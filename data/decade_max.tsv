12314	12314	S1V0013P0-00070	1809-03-09	[CONDUCT OF THE DUKE OF YORK.]	Mr. Whitbread.		"Mr. Whitbread. Much as it was my wish to have followed the Chancellor of the Exchequer in this debate, I am now glad that the rt. hon. gent., who last addressed you, has interposed; and that the house has had the advantage of hearing his clear and judicious statement of that part of the voluminous mass of evidence upon your table, to which he has chosen more particularly to advert. It will save you the trouble of hearing any thing from me on that head of the subject. His deductions are fair and perspicuous; his arguments sound, and such, as I think, no man can overturn. I agree entirely in the conclusions he has drawn, and think he has put the house in possession of all that can be urged in support of them. In the speech which he concluded this evening, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has surpassed himself. I can with truth say, that, in my opinion, a better speech has never been delivered by any living member of the House of Commons. Greatly as I differ from him, on the subject now under deliberation, I could not withhold my tribute of applause, and admiration, to the talents which he 160 has displayed. If, unhappily, the D. of Y. shall fall under the censure of this house, certain I am that his misfortune will not have arisen from the want of an advocate in the administration, willing, and able to defend his cause. I confess that, at first, I was much affected by the ingenious eloquence of the right hon. gent.; but, reflection has restored the impressions, which the hearing, and consideration of the evidence, had previously made upon my mind, and those impressions I am about to submit to the house. Sir, although I have the misfortune to differ from the right hon. gentleman, respecting the Charges against the D. of Y., I am nevertheless, fully prepared to admit that he has been actuated by conscientious motives. In his speech there has been a perfect consistency with the sentiments he has uniformly maintained. I purposely make this early admission, in order that, if I should hereafter find it necessary to animadvert with severity upon any parts of that speech, it may be imputed to the nature of the subject, and not to a deficiency of respect for the intentions, or personal character of the speaker. Sir, the right hon. gent. began, and concluded his speech, with vehement attacks on my hon. friend, the mover of the great question now before the house. I own, I was not a little surprised, to hear my hon. friend arraigned for having said, that the country, after the event of this discussion, would sit in judgment on the conduct of the House of Commons. I cannot, in that expression, discover any thing inconsistent with the spirit of our functions, or the usage of our debates. Nothing of an improper or unconstitutional interference was, I am sure, intended by ray hon. friend, in his candid and manly appeal to the people. He had a right to make it. In making it, he might justly feel great pride; and he has certainly not exceeded the bounds of his parliamentary duty. But it is singular enough, that such observations should come from the Chancellor of the Exchequer; whose administration was ushered in by a threat from his colleague, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, that if the house did not support the king's ministers, an appeal should be made from it to the people. The house was not found sufficiently pliant, and the threat was carried into execution; when the people, to whom the appeal was to be made, had been by the vilest arts excited to temporary madness. Such an accusation then comes with ill grace from the  161 right hon. gent. and has no foundation in propriety or truth. The right hon. gent. also complains, that through an indecent abuse of the Liberty of the Press, garbled extracts from the evidence have been circulated and commented upon with industrious malignity in the numerous diurnal and weekly publications; that gross libels are sent forth against the I), of Y. and he still maintains that there is a plan, the object of which is, to write down the house of Brunswick, and to bring the royal family into contempt. If an3' such false libels there are, uttered in furtherance of so base a scheme, I call upon his learned Associate at his right hand (the Attorney General) to discover and bring to punishment the authors. He cannot be accused of any want of discernment, or of inactivity in his office. But, perhaps, by the word Libels, it may be intended to mark with reprobation the strictures upon the present proceedings of this house. I have read many of those strictures; in which there are, doubtless, occasional misrepresentations, some of them of a nature to be complained of by the right hon. gentleman and the supporters of the Duke of York. Of others, I myself, and those who think the accusations against h. r. h. well founded, have equal reason to complain. Even to-morrow there may be much foul and gross misrepresentation of what I shall say this night. Such circumstances are to be lamented. Notwithstanding, I take it to be highly beneficial that free comments should be made on our conduct. I must, however, be permitted to observe, that the right hon. gent. triumphantly forced into publicity these proceedings. The evidence has gone forth by authority. Could he expect that on a question of such vital interest, the press would be silent? or that the public would refrain from commenting on that which the house directed to be laid before it?  Sir, the right hon. gent. has answered these questions himself. He has acknowledged that nothing has occurred which leads him to repent of a choice which in a difficult case he thought it right to recommend; that the grounds of our determination will be as well known to the public as to ourselves; and that we could not have the benefit of publicity without its attendant evils. With this recapitulation of his own sentiments, I shall dismiss that part of his appeal to the feelings of his audience.  Sir, I shall here notice another passage, towards the conclusion of the speech of 162 the right hon. gent. calculated to work upon our passions. It is that in which he hinted at the practical inconvenience of removing the D. of Y. from the office of Commander in Chief. He tells us that if the D. of Y. is removed, a species of military interregnum will be created; and we are bid to recollect, there is none other who can supply his place. Sir, I hope we have men who can supply his place. I hope we have many officers fit to succeed the D. of Y. We are told in an animated enumeration of the services rendered by the D. of Y. to the army, to recollect whom it is we are proposing to remove. His attentive regard 10 the interests of the officer, and to the comfort of the soldier; the establishment of charitable institutions under his auspices, for the support and protection of the widows and orphans of those who have fallen in the service of their country, are pathetically displayed before us. The political inconvenience of having any but a member of the royal family in this high situation, whom the different changes of administration do not affect, and who, therefore, cannot be induced to sacrifice the interests of the army to party purposes, is artfully stated. Above all, we are reminded, that in voting for his removal, we vote for the degradation of a -member of the royal family: and we are told of our deep interest in upholding the character of every descendant from the throne. Sir, I am not now disposed to question the truth of the panegyric bestowed upon the Commander in Chief: the usefulness of his regulations in the army; the claim he has upon the gratitude of the officer, and the affection of the soldier or his pure administration of the patronage of the profession, as fat-as relates to politics. But these merits cannot avail him against his own acts; and must not be allowed to influence our determination in opposition to that which has been proved. I wish to uphold the character of the royal family, and should have been glad to prevent the degradation of the D. of Y.; but to attempt the latter would be vain, he has made it impossible. Moreover, I am compelled to say, that to me there appear the strongest objections to the placing any member of the royal family in a responsible employment. Such are the salutary prejudices of mankind, that it is impossible for us to treat this royal personage as we would do any other public servant. Such is the fascination of Royalty! see  163 how its magic shield is thrown over the D. of Y.! Put out of the question for a moment the charge of connivance at corruption. Does any man think that if a tenth part of those things which by universal consent have been brought home to the D. of Y., and which the right. hon. gent. has proposed to the house to censure, had been proved upon any other subject, filling the same office, he could have retained his situation for a single hour? Would it have been endured, that any person except one of the blood royal should have remained Commander in Chief of the military force of the United Kingdom, for a moment, after the disclosure of only a few of the facts, which have been unhappily proved at your bar? Sir the state must not he left without remedy for the evils which, unredressed, would lead to its destruction. If the delinquencies of the Commander in Chief cannot be punished, for fear of degrading the D. of Y., I deem it a matter of deep regret that he was ever appointed to that office; and a conclusive argument is afforded to me, against any branch of the royal family ever in future filling a situation of public trust. Sir, I would willingly check myself. I wish not to enter into a detail of the failings of the D. of Y. Each of us has but too many. God have mercy upon us all! But if there are, in the conduct of the D. of Y., immoralities of such a nature, as that, connected with his high station, the indulgence of them threatens to bring this country to its ruin; if the proof of such immoralities is brought before us, we must not, we cannot, shut our eyes, and say we do not see them. Having seen them, and witnessed the miserable result to which they have led, we must dismiss all inferior considerations; we have but one course to pursue. Sir, these observations are wrung from me. I do not, as the Chancellor of the Exchequer was pleased to insinuate against the members on this side of the house, wish to catch at every thing I can find against h. r. h. Such imputation was unjustly cast upon us. We have no pleasure in detecting the faults of the D. of Y., but we owe a duty to the public, and, however painful, we must perform it. Here I am led to notice what was said by a learned gentleman, (Mr. Burton,) in the early part of this debate. His speech has been greatly extolled by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. His advanced age, and judicial character, added to his unfortunate depri- 164 vation of sight, to which he himself alluded, insure attention, and give due weight, to every thing he utters in this house. He has endeavoured also to throw an artificial solemnity over the whole; by reminding us how soon, in the course of nature, he will have to appear before the last dreadful tribunal: by way of impressing upon our minds a sense of the inflexible adherence to truth with which he feels himself compelled to speak. Such warning, Sir, was superfluous. The youngest amongst us who is not guided by a consideration, that in this cause he ought to decide according to the dictates of his conscience; and that he moves under the eye of Him who sees all our actions and knows the inmost recesses of our hearts, is not likely to have his feelings sharpened as he advances in age. In the midst of life, we are in death: and many who have not numbered the years of the learned judge, may sooner than him, reach that goal to which all men are perpetually approaching. But notwithstanding his advantages, for advantages he has, as an orator in a popular assembly composed of men of liberal feelings like this; I must take leave to treat the speech of that learned gentleman, with as little ceremony as I should that of any other member. That honourable and learned gent. began his speech, by informing us, that he had a partiality for my hon. friend (Mr. Wardle,) and that his prejudices, if any, were against the D. of Y. (Murmurs of No! No!) I certainly understood the honourable and learned gentleman so to say; that he came to the consideration of this subject, with some prejudice against the D. of Y. but with great partiality for the integrity, the honour, the courage, of my honourable friend. He, good easy man, had lent too ready an ear to the reports industriously circulated against the reputation of the D. of York. He had given credit to those calumnious libels, which he had been induced to read; whether out of respect to their authors, or from the ingenuity of the performances, he has not vouchsafed to tell us; and it was only by the evidence produced at your bar, that he was happily undeceived; that he discovered his own error, and the immaculate conduct of the D. of York. Sir, I came to the question, under the same impressions as the learned judge, as far as they regard my honourable friend, of whose integrity I felt sure; but my impressions differed from his, as  165 relating to h. r. h., for I disbelieved the stories told of the Duke of York. I shall hereafter have occasion to return to the speech of the learned judge, and to examine how far prejudices and partialities have produced their usual effects upon his judgment. Sir, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, having delivered to us a precept not to deal in unhandsome insinuations against each other, alluding to what has passed in the course of former debates, proceeded to state that he was quite sure, that my hon. friend (Mr. Wardle) had not consulted his own manly feelings in offering his proposition to the house: that it was the production of cooler heads, of men who carry their meaning beyond that of my hon. friend, and further than they care to let him know. Insinuating, that he is under the direction of some unnamed persons. If the right hon. gent. means to say, that my hon. friend has lent himself, to further the selfish views of mischievous people, or that he himself entertains any views, other than those which an honourable man ought to entertain, and such as are unworthy of an independent member of parliament, those assertions I would venture flatly to deny. Who are the persons he means to designate as men of cool heads, I know not. The right hon. gent. has not told us. If by mixing himself in counsel with cooler heads, was meant, that my hon. friend had in a matter of such difficulty and importance consulted men on whose ability and judgment he had reliance; it charges him with no more than his duty, and may be received as a compliment. Assuming the expression to have been ironical, it deserves the contempt of my hon. friend, notwithstanding the quarter from which it came. As nothing, sir, was ever more interesting to the public, than this whole proceeding, and as it is essential the world should know who the conspirators are, if any there be, or rather who they are not, I shall beg leave to advert to the origin of the accusation, which I do for no other purpose, than that my hon. friend may stand on his proper ground. Sir, it is far from being matter of reproach to a member of parliament, that he asks the advice, or assistance of other members, in any business he may undertake, or to any member that he affords them, but I think it right, that the fact should appear as it really is, even in a minute particular.   It has been supposed, that in the beginning my honourable friend had advisers, whom he 166 did not chuse to bring forward, and who dared not avow themselves. Such a sup position is as unfounded, as it is unworthy of my honourable friend, and of those who have supported him. Some things were said in the earlier part of the investigation, evidently with a view to induce a disclaimer of all connection with my hon. friend, and his cause: and some advantage was attempted to be taken of him in that way, at the time when one of the charges which he exhibited against the Duke was supposed to have failed; which charge, although I do not yet assert that it is proved, bears a very different aspect from what it did on that day. I own, I then thought the whole of the charges, would ultimately amount to nothing. We had then a good deal of idle vaunting. It was said, there were persons behind the curtain, who sheltered themselves in silence. The case was deemed desperate. But the moment when the case of my hon. friend appeared desperate was not, in: my mind, the moment for me to disclaim him, or to state that I was not his adviser. The dictates of generosity forbad it. The attack which was made was unparliamentary and irregular. Sir, no member of this house has a right to call upon another of its members, to state, what share he has had, or whether he has had any share, in advising the commencement of any measure. From the manner of it, I supposed the attack was directed against me,c although, when repeatedly called upon, the right hon. gent. (Mr. Secretary Canning) who made it, did not think proper to say so. This is the fit and convenient time to say that I did not advise any part of this proceeding. It is now many years since an intimate acquaintance commenced between my hon. friend and me. Events separated us, and for nearly twenty years our intercourse had been interrupted. It was renewed in this house. Before my hon. friend gave public notice of his intentions, he called upon me, and told me the Charges he intended to produce, and stated the nature of the evidence by which they were to be supported. I frankly told him that the substance of the thing appeared to me incredible, that the testimony by which his allegations were to be made good, was of the most doubtful sort, and that there seemed to be many links deficient in the chain of proof. I warned him of the heart-burnings which the discussion of such a subject would excite; of the numerous enemies he would create;  167 and I painted to him in strong colours, the storm to which in the event of failure, he would inevitably be exposed. He was, however, resolved. Finding him so, I told him, Since you are determined to bring forward these Charges, I shall attend in my place in the house of commons: upon, a. bare statement of the facts, I shall vote for a committee to enquire into them, and I think no man will be found to vote against it. Such, sir, is the history of all the communication I have had with my lion, friend upon this subject, except some casual conversation on meeting him twice accidentally, in the street, of the duration of a very few minutes only. Thus ends the tale of my advice to my hon. friend, and of the share which I have taken in secret, of the assistance I have given him behind the curtain. What share in the business I have taken before the curtain, it is needless for me to say. The house has seen it. Sir, I understand, that my hon. friend, in my absence, was generous and kind enough to use expressions very flattering to me, for which I thank him; confessing at the same time, that I did for him no more than I should think myself bound to do for any other member of parliament in the same situation. My object was to see fair ploy. I mean nothing injurious to gentlemen on the other side of the house. They had their feelings as I had mine. They viewed things through one medium, I through another. My object was such as I am bound to believe theirs to have been. My endeavours are, as I am bound to suppose theirs are, directed to the attainment of justice; and through the medium of justice, of tranquillity to the public mind. There have perhaps been many occasions on which my honourable friend had a right to expect assistance from the learned members on the other side of the house, but it has not been afforded to him on any. Again, sir, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has alledged unmanliness of conduct against my hon. friend, for the manner in which he has thought proper to shape his address. He does not scruple to say of him, that he now flies off, that he flinches from that; with which he had, at first, the rashness to charge the D. of Y., that he shrinks from the execution of his duty, that he meanly endeavours to dispose of the whole by a measure framed with complicated ambiguity. Has he indeed done so? Has he flinched from the Charges which he has exhibited against the D. of Y.? Do the advocates of h. r. h. really think so? Does my hon. friend 168 acknowledge that he has left the Charges unproved? Does he not assert that he has now given full proof that the D. of Y. knew the transactions, in which Mrs. C. was engaged for military promotions, in the name, and under the auspices of h. r. h.? Does he not say that he has proved a direct communication from Mrs. C. to h. r. h. of the names of those whom she wished to have promoted in the army; that he promised to promote them; that they were actually promoted; and that there appeared, for some of such promotions, n* reason upon earth, except the recommendation of Mrs. C.? Does he not manfully say that these things are proved r Weil then, what objection does there lie against my hon. friend on the ground of manly conduct in debate? what would his opponents have of him? But it seems that the manner in which the address moved by my hon. friend is worded, is obnoxious to every sort of reproach. It is stated by the. learned judge to be fraught with cruelty and injustice: and the right hon. gent, has characterized it as adopted for the purpose of presenting an insidious alternative, with a view to catch the straggling votes of those, who, disbelieving the accusation, may have public or personal motives for wishing for the removal of the D. of Y. Can there be any persons, members of this house, to whom the imputation conveyed by such condemnation of the motion will apply? Upon whom has the right hon. gent. fixed his eye? Sir, I disclaim, as a supporter of the address, the motives ascribed to the mover for the construction of it, by both those learned gentlemen. I conceive, that it is highly commendable for its temperance and moderation. It conveys indeed, a direct, and clear communication to the throne, on the conduct of the D. of Y., but in language, such as I presume to think ought, upon such an occasion, to be used at the foot of the throne. It speaks of the Commander in Chief, in terms which convey no personal disrespect: and in which neither the dignity of the sovereign, nor the feelings of the father, are insulted. How whimsical are the objections urged against my hon. friend! The right hon. gent. now objects, or, affects to object, to the address, because it is not sufficiently decisive; meaning, if in this place any meaning such an expression has, that it is not sufficiently severe against h. r. h. But, if my hon. friend had adopted language less mild, I am confident we should have been told  169 of the cruelty of addressing the throne in terms unnecessarily harsh. ""Could you not adopt a milder tone?"" ""What necessity for harsh language, the meaning would have been perfectly intelligible without it?"" and such remarks would have been well applied. Sir, this is but a common-place way of meeting any proposition, however framed. It is couched in terms of mildness, and therefore is not sufficiently direct and manly. Had the false and affected manliness for which these gentlemen are now such advocates, been adopted, they might then with some shew of justice have made the outcry we should have been sure to have heard against it for its severity and harshness. I think, the language of the address now before us, is in the just medium between the extremes; it is decorous to the throne, and at the same time expressive of a determined spirit on the part of the commons. Sir, the long experience, and known parliamentary skill of the right hon. gentleman render it beneath him to talk of entrapping members into a vote for the whole of the address of my hon. friend, when they do not believe the charges of corruption brought against the D. of Y.; because the address also contains assertions relative to other parts of the conduct of h. r. h. which they think deserving of censure. I was even surprized that the learned judge should have condescended to state, that a majority might vote for this address, upon different and even contradictory grounds. How little acquaintance with parliamentary form does it require to avoid such a snare. Amend the address! leave out the parts which charge a knowledge of corrupt practices, and retain the rest! You, who think that of the corruption proved, it was possible he should be ignorant: yet agree with us in declaring that after such influence as has been unquestionably demonstrated, it is not expedient he should remain at the head of the army! Thus the Gordian-knot is untied, the snare is thus easily escaped. But, sir, it was never planted. Observe too, that the right hon. gent. has a formidable lecture ready for h. r. h. The Duke does not escape without chastisement from his hands. He wishes the house of commons gravely to submit to the throne that ""under the cover of a connexion formed by h. r. h. the existence of which has caused in us the most sincere regret and concern, transactions of the most criminal and disgraceful mature have been carried on: and that an 170 opportunity has been thus afforded of coupling the name of the D. of Y. with such transactions; whereby the integrity of his conduct in the discharge of the duties of his high office has been brought into question."" We are all agreed then, as to the fact thus strongly stated in the proposed address of the right hon. gent. If that be so, we say, the D. of Y. cannot, retain his office, it would be dangerous to the public that he should do so. No, says the right hon. gent., it is so, but it would be contrary to the interests of the country that he should be removed from his office. Let the house and the country judge between us. But I think I have shewn the accusation against my hon. friend on the structure of his address to be ill founded. Sir, for the whole of that address I shall vote: and I will add that few of the opinions expressed by my horn friend (Mr. Wardle) upon this matter, are substantially different from my own. I cannot disguise my conviction as a member of parliament, after having heard and most attentively considered the whole of the evidence, that the D. of Y. could not possibly be ignorant of the corruptions, which have been related by Mrs. C. at your bar. Sir, if I thought the D. of Y. innocent, I would eagerly say so, in term* as unambiguous, as I now say that I think he is guilty. That is to a degree guilty I say to a degree guilty; for there are in my estimation many shades of difference, and many degrees of guilt. The monstrous doctrine of the Chancellor of the Exchequer that in point of moral turpitude, personal corruption, or connivance at corruption, are the same thing, and especially in this case, needs but to be stated to be exposed. It is a fallacy, which must have been thrown out to mislead us; to the consideration of which I shall hereafter return. Sir, I feel no disposition whatever to respect the veil of sanctity, which, as a last resource, the right hon. gent. has made a faint attempt to throw over the royal Duke. The question of Prerogative was slightly hinted at, but instantly abandoned. Another objection, however, has been urged in a shape as formidable as it could be made to assume, which, (if attended to) would go the length of precluding us from voting any censure against the D. of Y., whatever may be our impressions as to his delinquency. We are warned against voting this address relative to the D. of York, because he may eventually ascend the throne: And upon  171 this possible contingency, the Chancellor of the Exchequer dwelt at great length. He painted to us the evils to be expected, from the degradation of a character, to whom we might hereafter be bound to look up as our sovereign. I think after what has been shewn, there is no way left for the restoration of the character of the D. of Y., but through his submission to the censure of the House of Commons. Through that ordeal he must pass. Then indeed if the event alluded to should take place, the clouds of these days, so far from obscuring, may add lustre to his reign. He who ascended the throne after having incurred the censure of the representatives of the people, would by his submission to that censure have recognized the power of that tribunal, to which the people of the British empire can appeal in case of any extraordinary emergency he would have felt that in England, all that is connected with royalty, is subject to the law, and not above it that the eventual heir to the throne has no exemption from those penalties, which attach upon him, as upon the most obscure inhabitant of the realm.  If by the dispensations of Providence it should hereafter happen that the IX of Y, should rule over this people, it may be well for him, and for us, that in the school of adversity he should have been taught the lessons of temperance and wisdom. Then may he rise, as many of illustrious birth and character have done before him, purified and greater by misfortune: better qualified for the discharge of the important duties he would have to perform.  Sir, I cannot be led astray from my duty, by such a consideration, however specious, and however dextrously urged.   Sir, I have been compelled to dwell at considerable length, upon the general topics urged by the right honourable gentleman and the learned judge, and something more remains to be done before I go into an examination of the particular cases: but I will not apologize, for the question is of the first magnitude. It is no less than a question upon the life and death of the character of the D. of York. Were we to be guided by the same rules which the learned judge has thought proper to lay down for the direction of his own mind, and the detail of which, for the benefit of others, he considered the most useful service he could render to the house, we should be reduced to a very7 strange situation. After having employed some weeks in the examination of 172 witnesses with great assiduity and perseverance, he calls upon us to discard the testimony of every one in the least material. Much of that testimony, the learned gent. has informed us, ought not to have been received, and he has given us the reasons why he did not stop it at the time. Indeed, sir, I think-that the evidence of every material witness must be blotted out, before we can vote for the resolution of acquittal proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, but I cannot consent to part with them, upon the mere authority of the learned gent., however much I may be inclined to respect it. The doctrine laid down by the learned judge, (whose dicta the Chancellor of the Exchequer leant upon, without affording much additional support to them, from his own legal stores) on the subject of the testimony of accomplices, was pushed to an extent infinitely beyond the opinions of the most eminent men of the profession, as far as my very limited information goes. I dare say the learned-judge has always acted in his own court upon the rules he has in this debate propounded to us, and the unconfirmed evidence of an accomplice in a crime, has never, I am sure, by him, been left to a jury; but if what the learned gent, has asserted to be his practice, had generally prevailed, many murders would have gone un punished; the real perpetrators of which have now suffered for their crimes. The unconfirmed testimony of an accomplice, even according to the practice of the courts, where stricter rules are adhered to, than are consistent with the usage, or would be beneficial in the proceedings, of this house; and in cases of capital offences too, is left to a jury, with such observations only, as the particular circumstances of the case may demand from the bench. We cannot, then, strike out the evidence of any witness who has appeared at your bar, merely because that witness is an accomplice. But the principal witness, Mrs. C. in whom, if there be a scintilla of truth, the D. of Y. is allowed to be guilty, is a woman of infamous character, and therefore she is not to be credited. The learned judge has carried it so far, (and the Chancellor of the Exchequer is very little behind him), as to assert, that she is of a class which makes her society contamination. Sir, I, for one, cannot admit of this sweeping disqualification of witnesses by classes. It is as barbarous, as it is extravagant. To what length would it lead  173 us? Shall we, an assembly of men, sitting in judgment upon a cause submitted to our decision, (in the conscious purity, I suppose, of our own lives, in the very point which is to operate the incapacity of unhappy women), decide, that because a woman has sacrificed the distinguishing virtue of the female sex, she has therefore forfeited all pretensions to credit? How base and unworthy a decision should we thus make? Sir, I need hardly call to your recollection, the illustration given by the Spectator of the general injustice of men towards the weaker sex; of the licentious freedom with which they treat the female character, and of their grounds of retaliation, if they had but the same means of giving them vent. The reply of the lion to the sculptor carries too keen an edge, I think, not to have been felt by every man who reads it. Of the treatment of those wretched outcasts from all the dignity, the ties, the comforts and endearments of social life, whom men first pretend to worship, then ruin, and then hold in contempt and abomination, I cannot speak in terms sufficiently strong to express my sense of its grievous injustice, or of their hard fate, and deplorable wretchedness. Shall we add to their miseries, the overwhelming disgrace of a total incapacity to utter truth? If the case were reversed, and they were to sit in judgment on men; which of them would not be able to convict some one man of perjury, of the basest and most detestable kind? But we all demand to be believed upon our oaths; aye, and upon our honours too. True it is, from step to step some prostitutes are led to such a total depravation of the moral sense, that their powers of distinguishing between truth and falshood are utterly extinguished, and from the circumstance of their initiation in one vice, they become capable of all. Let us recollect, however, that we have had examples of great depravity exhibited before us from other descriptions of witnesses. That the conviction of depravity in one, or more than one, of a particular class or profession, does not disqualify the whole of that body. If it did, I fear that Captains would fare ill hereafter in courts of justice, fur we have capt. Sandon now confined in Newgate expiating the offence of his gross prevarication at your bar. Alas, sir, could we believe even General Officers, if the fault of one were to disqualify all? Gen. Clavering we cannot be- 174 lieve, and if bound by the rules of impartial justice, because we cannot believe him, he must be sent to Newgate also. Chastity is a great virtue, but there is a commandment as binding as the one which imposes the obligation of chastity, wherein it is said, ""Thou shall not bear false witness against thy neighbour."" Sir, there is nothing in the character of the life led by Mrs. C. which disqualifies her as a witness in a court of justice. In cases of property, witnesses of her description have often given decisive testimony. There happens to be a remarkable instance which but lately occurred in the courts below, where two decisions were given in the case of a will, upon the sole testimony of such a witness; and her veracity was not then questioned, nor has it since been impeached*. The instances are innumerable wherein convicts have suffered death on the sole testimony of witnesses of a lower degree, and of more dissolute lives. Mrs. Clarke then, Sir, appears to me, to be a witness, whose testimony must have weight, although she is stiled an accomplice, and although she has led a dissolute life. It is not for either of those two reasons that you can strike your pen through the evidence she has delivered. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has boldly stated, that in the whole course of his professional life, he never met with a witness so wholly unworthy of credit as Mrs. C.; and, having made as much as he could of the general disqualifying circumstances which, he says, attend her, he has recourse to her palpable contradictions and detected falsehoods. That she is open to the imputation of self-contradiction, and detected falsehood, I am not prepared to deny; but, that those falsehoods and contradictions leave her without a spark of credibility, I do deny; and that her evidence upon oath, in a court of justice, would be received, I firmly believe. As to her contradictions. Let us have some feeling of justice towards her in a situation so difficult, as to have obtained indulgence for all the persons who have ever been placed in it. Did any witness, with the most upright intentions, fortified by the habits of business, and possessed of the greatest ability, ever go through a long examination at, the bar, amidst the numerous, desultory, *Mr. Whitbread is supposed to have alluded to the evidence of Mrs. Carey, taken in two on the will of Mr. Smith Owen.  175 irrelevant, and perplexing questions, which are perpetually asked, with perfect accuracy and consistency, without one slip or one contradiction? Sir, the thing is, I believe, impossible. To demonstrate it to be so, I need only say, that it has not happened to col. Gordon himself. But in all other cases allowance is made. Some witnesses are permitted to explain or correct their evidence; for others, a liberal construction is put by the house upon inconsistencies which, under such circumstances, are excusable; if not of that grave and wilful cast to call for punishment, (none fell upon Mrs. Clarke). For her no allowance is to be made. She had united, for her discomfiture, the first legal talents, and the greatest authority of the house; and every slip, in the course of an examination of extreme length and severity, is to be noted down as destructive of her credibility. Sir, this proves too much, and therefore is good for nothing. I shall hereafter examine the particular contradictions, and the nature of the falsehoods, in which she has been detected. The accidental introduction of colonel Gordon's name in this part of my speech, leads me to notice a glaring mistake into which the learned gent, has fallen. When stating the presumptions in favour of the D. of Y., he told us, that he could not have been in the remotest degree acquainted with the foul transactions going on; for he had fenced himself round against malpractices, by such characters as Brownrigg and Lorraine, and by the adoption of Gordon, as his bosom friend and the observer of all his actions. Sir, the learned gent, must excuse me. Such is not the state of the case. Col. Gordon does not appear to have been the bosom friend of the D. of Y. He was officially employed by the D. of Y., and a better officer was never appointed to any situation. Unhappily he was not the depository of the secrets of the Duke; if he had, there would have been none such as we have heard, to be divulged. Sir, the house will recollect, that the truth of all the transactions imputed to his royal highness is consistent with the most perfect official regularity. Nay, it was almost necessary to the scheme, if such a scheme existed. It would, indeed, have been an act of inconceivable insanity for the Commander in Chief to have attempted such practices at the Horse-Guards. No, sir, it is not at the Horse-Guards nor at home, nor under the eye of col. Gordon; but abroad, at the house of Mrs. C, before 176 the matters came to the office, that this scene of corruption is laid, and with a studious and successful endeavour to elude the vigilance of all official persons. Again, the right hon. gent, insists, that Mrs. C. is not to be believed because she comes here, urged by sentiments of rancour, hatred and malice, against the D. of Y., because she is irritated by his desertion of her, because she threatened to expose him upon his non-compliance with her terms, and finally because she has brought him here for the purpose of exposing him. Sir, if my belief of her, is to depend upon my opinion that the assertions I have just quoted, are well founded or otherwise, I should be compelled to believe, because I do not find a solid foundation for any one of them. First, Sir, I deny that there has appeared, in the examination of Mrs. Clarke at the bar of this house, any symptoms of a deep-laid plan of revenge. It would not indeed be very extraordinary, if Mrs. Clarke, should be actuated by strong feelings of resentment; for upon the case disclosed, the conduct of the D. of Y. in withholding from her the annuity he had promised her, does not appear to me to be justified by any conduct of hers, and is far from creditable to him. I have formed my opinion on this matter not upon the statement of Mrs. C. alone; but upon that statement confirmed by the evidence of Mr. Lowten and Mr. Wilkinson, who were called to prove, what had been communicated to the house by my hon. friend Mr. Adam, for whom I have the highest respect, but who in fact did not quite make good all that he had been led to believe was true. I agree with the Chancellor of the Exchequer that the annuity ought to have been given unconditionally, and that the amount of it ought to have been more liberal. I see- no pretence for the non-payment of it. It is not proved to us that she used the D. of Y.'s name for the purpose of obtaining money after their separation. Even if she had, I should have thought it a harsh measure, to have punished her by depriving her of the only means she had of subsistence; which punishment at the same time would have been wholly ineffectual to its purpose, or indeed must have counteracted it. But the penalty was never incurred, for it is not proved that she acted at any time incorrectly, according to the interpretation of the word given by my learned friend. Be that as it may, I deny that the irritation produced in her mind by this natural cause of re-  177 sentment against the Duke, is such as ought to make us incredulous of what she says. In the next place I do not agree with the right hon. gent. that she has threatened to expose h. r. h. for the purpose of extorting money from him. True it is, that driven to great pecuniary distress, she did inform my learned friend Mr. Adam, that she should be under the necessity of having recourse to the means which were in her power to obtain a supply. Sir, I refer to the letter addressed by Mrs. C. to Mr. Adam of the 19th June 1808. I protest, I see nothing in that letter which can justify the expression applied to it by the right hon. gentleman. Her repeated applications to the D. of Y. had failed; three quarters only of her miserable pittance had been paid. She was then compelled to solicit, for that is the expression, of h. r. h., the payment of the arrear due, and a security for the future payments. She states her necessities to be very pressing, and that the Duke knows them to be so. She adds that if he refuses, she has no other mode, of supplying her immediate wants, than to publish all the circumstances of their connexion. At the same time she expresses the strongest wish that her request may be complied with, both for his sake and her own. Not receiving any answer to this letter, she was induced to write another, couched in stronger terms than the former, still alledging the strong temptation of her poverty, still praying not to be driven to extremities; but by no means amounting to that style of menace which ought to induce us to discredit her. The solution of all this is simple and easy, without having recourse to the existence of those deep-laid plans which are represented as intended finally to produce the exposure of these unhappy transactions at your bar. Sir, the persons best acquainted with Mrs. C. were also acquainted with her distresses, and with the connexion which had so long subsisted between her and the Duke, and must have known her to be possessed of materials, which if wrought into a publication, would produce a considerable sum of money? Was it not natural they should suggest to her such a step for her convenience, and their own? Was it not probable that the fact of her having such documents should be rapidly conveyed from mouth to mouth, till at last it would come to the knowledge of persons who would make her considerable offers? Was not the 178 temptation in that case strong? and are the terms in which the existence of that temptation was communicated, (in candour left me ask it?) are those terms so highly offensive, and of such a menacing nature as they are represented to be? I contend they are not. Sir, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has told us that it was quite impossible for the Duke to comply with Mrs. Clarke's request, that if he had done so, he would have exposed himself to conclusions, most injurious to his reputation. Sir, again I differ from the right hon. gentleman. I think that the D. of Y., if he had been well advised, would have complied with her just request. Nay, sir, the pledge of his word could alone be redeemed by his so doing. Her claim upon him has been talked of. She made no claim. He had voluntarily offered the annuity. It is preposterous to say, that the refusal of the D. of Y. to accede to the terms proposed, is a conclusive proof of his innocence. Sir, again the proof goes too far. I would ask of any man who hears me, whether, putting out of the question all connivance at corruption, or any letters or documents from which it may be inferred, would he not have given a large sum to have stifled the publication of such trash as has been read at your table. But trash as it is, it was money's worth. Sir, I own, that he who would risk such an exposure, might in my opinion possibly have risked much more, from negligence, inattention, or in the confidence that she would not have the courage to publish. I wish, sir, that the annuity had been paid with all my heart. It ought to have been paid. The painful exhibition we have witnessed would then have been spared. You, sir, would have been spared the trouble of listening to the reasoning, upon which I build my conviction of the guilt of the D. of Y. The house would have been spared the shame, and the public the disgust, too fatally attending this whole proceeding. Irritated as she must have been, reasonably irritated, against the D. of Y., did she preserve the materials with care, by which alone she could have carried her plans into execution? Would she, in that case, have given her letters in heaps to the landlord of the house where she lodged, to have been burned? some of them have been preserved in an extraordinary manner, and were produced, not by herself, but against her; nevertheless, confirming many of  179 those parts of her evidence, which appeared the most improbable and extravagant. Sir, I do not find, in the evidence which she delivered at the bar, any indications of such feelings of vengeance. Did she immediately and eagerly produce the fatal manuscripts of the royal Duke, which are now recorded upon the Minutes of evidence? Did not a circumstance of a most important nature intervene, between the first examination of Mrs. C. and the production of those letters? Had not gen. Clavering voluntarily appeared at the bar, for the avowed purpose of impeaching her credibility? This witness introduced himself to the house, by a formal application to the Attorney General; stating that he had something of great moment to communicate. We were all anxious to know what this communication, could be No one doubted, but that its effect would be the destruction of Mrs. Clarke as a witness. It very soon appeared to the house, that the General had not very correct ideas of the nature of evidence, and that the ground, upon which he attempted to impeach her credibility by the assertion she had made to him relative to her living with a Mr. Mellish, was not tenable. But he flatly contradicted her, as to his canvassing some members of parliament at her instance, to vote for a particular measure; and he asserted, with the greatest solemnity, that he never was acquainted with any person, who ever asked Mrs. C. to use her influence with the Commander in Chief, on the subject of army promotions. It has been well stated by an honourable member, that he who ventures to impeach the testimony of another, should himself come with clean hands. That gen. Clavering came with clean hands all must have agreed; and although, when scrutinized, his evidence amounted to nothing in point of falsifying the testimony of Mrs. C., the language of the hour was, that general Clavering had thrown discredit upon her; the prevailing opinion in the house, the triumphant statement of the friends of the D. of Y. was, that after such an attack on the part of a person of high honour and consideration, who had been acquainted with her for some years, no faith could be given to any thing she said. Then, and not till then, did Mrs. C. produce the letter from the D. of Y., which mentions the name-of gen. Clavering, and disproves the assertion he had made at your bar. Then, and not tilt then, did she 180 tell the story of her having made an application to the Commander in Chief, on the behalf of that very man, who had officiously presented himself to impeach her credibility, whilst she had in her power the means by which she afterwards proved, that he, and not herself, had given false witness. Then, and not till then, did she produce under the D. of Y.'s hand-writing, a confirmation of the improbable tale she had related, about the recommendation of Dr. O'Meara to a bishopric. Who for a single moment believed that story when it was first told? Who did not treat it as a fiction of her own brain, a pure romance? Who could have believed that she could have produced a letter written by the Commander in Chief, to shew that a clergyman of the established church, of dignity sufficient to aspire to the mitre, had placed himself under the protection of Mrs. Clarke, and that h. r. h. had condescended to assist the views of that reverend divine upon her recommendation? that she could produce a document signed by the archbishop of Tuam, (not indeed addressed to her, but to Dr. O'Meara himself) genuine however and undisputed? Sir, if the plans of vengeance ascribed to her by the right honourable gentleman had been so deeply laid as he contends they were, if she had been actuated by that deadly hatred and malice which he has so forcibly pourtrayed, if she had brought the D. of Y. here for the purpose of exposing him, would not these letters have been put in front of the battle? Would she have waited till gen. Clavering had awakened her recollection to their existence; till it became necessary to expose to the world which was the false witness? till it became necessary to shew that the circumstance of a clergyman asking, receiving, and finding effectual to a certain extent, her protection, was no romantic tale, but a simple narrative of a fact? Sir, I have seen no traces in her conduct, either in her applications to my learned friend Mr. Adam, in her examination in chief, or in her cross-examination, which lead me to disbelieve her because she acts under the baneful influence of the passions imputed to her. True it is, that when from the hoards of Mr. Nicholls, whom the learned judge has considered the sheet anchor of testimony, but who appears to me dishonestly to have retained letters committed to his servant, for the express purpose of being destroyed, and under the implied engagement that they  181 should be destroyed; and who afterwards unjustly withheld from her the property which he had thus fraudulently obtained; when from the hoards of Mr. Nicholls, and amongst the number of those letters which had been thus accidentally preserved, there did appear recorded in the hand-writing of gen. Clavering, in characters as black as Erebus, a further condemnation of that witness, and another conclusive contradiction of the evidence which he had given, a smile of satisfaction did overspread her countenance: and if she was gratified by this complete over- throw of her adversary; by the detection of one who, she thought, owed her something of kindness and had repaid her with ingratitude, who, in his attempts to destroy her, had so egregiously duped himself; I own for one, I can forgive it. I can pardon the emotion of pleasure which I perceived, and do not ascribe it to any other than the uncontroulable impulse of our nature. To gen. Clavering is to be attributed, and to his interference, the disclosure of some of the circumstances which bear the hardest upon the D. of Y.; and he came before you to impose his own statements upon the house under the mask of exposing the falsehoods of others. Sir the right hon. gent. has been induced to confess, (what was sufficiently obvious,) that Mrs. Clarke completely foiled all her examiners. The right hon. gent. has endeavoured to account for the fact, in a manner which is not satisfactory to me. He has told us, in terms which I am not inclined to contradict, of her sarcastic insolence, and playful pleasantry, her general cleverness and versatility, her art and trick in answering those questions which she chose to answer, her dexterity in evading others, and misleading the examiner, and of her unblushing effrontery. This I acknowledge to be a true representation, as far as it goes. Added to all this, she displayed a great deal of firmness and consistency; and there we shall find the true solution of her success, his failure, and that of his learned colleagues. Am I to be gravely told that an examination, conducted by the persons of the nation selected, as it is presumed, because their natural abilities and their acquirements are superior to those of other men (the present Attorney General and the Chancellor of the Exchequer who was lately Attorney General, assisted by a corps-de-reserve, to give advice, and to step forth upon an emergency, with nume- 182 rous watchers to take up every slip or failure, and turn it to the best account,) against an unlearned woman, submitted to the process of examination, cross-examination, and reexamination, at various times, for hours together; incurring the displeasure of the house, ordered out on a sudden, and on a sudden recalled, and immediately proceeded with; ending with the humiliating confession, ""She has baffled us all."" Am I to be told, that this examination has failed through the art, dexterity, pertness, wit, and playfulness of the witness? Sir, I must ascribe such success, and such discomfiture, to other causes. I cannot be persuaded that any thing, but a foundation of truth, could have supported Mrs. C. against the combination of talents, experience, and power, arrayed against her. I have no faith in the dexterity of witnesses; nor do I believe it possible, that address can prevail against acuteness, when unsupported by the truth. Sir, I have seen many an artful, dexterous witness overthrown; and I would rather risk the success of a cause upon the evidence of the dullest witness ever exhibited, intending to speak the truth, in defiance of the most acute examiners; than upon the ingenuity of the most dexterous witness that ever appeared in court with a contrary intention. I will not pay so ill a compliment to the learned gentleman, hi* associates, or to the right hon. gent. himself, as to accede to his position. They have not been all defeated by the superior ability of their frail antagonist. Sir, concurring in some part of the censure upon the witness, I think some indulgence also may be extended to her. Her sex, the novel situation in which she was placed, the extraordinary and interesting scene; herself the object of the eager curiosity of every eye in the house, are all to be taken into consideration. If some flippancy at the beginning produced a great deal of mirth, was it extraordinary, that she should persevere in a course which had produced that effect? The house must take some share of the blame. If hon. members would indulge in merriment, they could only expect a continuance of the display which had excited it. It was not to be expected, that questions asked in the midst of laughter should be answered with that steadiness and decorum, which the witness was afterwards, inconsistently enough, reminded, was demanded by the dignity of this house. Sir, I believe I have drawn a true picture of the levity of  183 the witness and of the conduct of the house; however reprehensible that conduct now appears. Sir, the learned judge has said, that, upon hearing the evidence read to him, he has discovered, and caused to be noted down, no less than twenty-eight contradictions of assertions made by Mrs. Clarke, by herself, and by other unimpeached witnesses. The learned gent. however, named only a very few of those contradictions; the remainder he has, as he informed us, in his pocket. I have not had the benefit of seeing them. I am therefore quite unable to discuss them. But it is fair and candid to suppose, that the learned gent. has put forward those which made the strongest impression upon his mind, and appeared to him of the greatest value. I will examine them. They amount to this, that Mrs. C. having been asked, whether she ever passed herself for a widow, or for the wife of Mr. Dowler, flatly denies that she ever did so: in which she is contradicted by different respectable witnesses. By whom is her testimony upon these points impeached? By witnesses who are all unimpeachable? By no means. Unless the being called on the part of the D. of Y, can purge off all impurities, and impart veracity and integrity. First, I will consider the evidence of that tremendous witness, Mr. Nicholls, upon whom so much stress has been laid! Before I agree in the opinion expressed of his purity, I must revert to the manner in which he became possessed of the letters which he produced; and to the fact, that, having possessed himself of them in the clandestine manner proved upon him, he dared refuse to give them up to the right owner? He knew they were sent down to be burnt. He knew their contents; for he had read them after the investigation began. He knew that they affected the character of Mrs. C. and were material to her support. According to the evidence given by Mr. Lowten, he trusted him, Mr. Lowten, with a slight examination of the letters, which Circumstance he did not mention himself. Now, sir, after such conduct, I cannot assent to the perfect purity of Mr. Nicholls. Does he prove what the learned judge asserts, that Mrs. C. made him believe that she was married to Mr. Dowler? There is a positive contradiction to his own testimony out of his own mouth, as to his belief of her being the wife of Mr. Dowler, because he has stated, that he never applied to Mr. Dowler for the satisfaction of his debt. We must not forget the 184 acute question put by my noble friend with which that part of the examination was closed: ""Did you ever apply to Mr. Dowler for the satisfaction of your debt?"" and the short conclusive answer ""Never."" Sir, when Mr. Nicholls has so positively contradicted himself, by such an avowal, I must be excused for not laying very great stress on the parts of his evidence, which go to the contradiction of another witness; especially when I consider that amongst all the letters, found in his possession and elsewhere, there is not a single scrap of paper addressed to her under the name of Dowler, and that Nicholls himself says she never was called, or Went by the name of Dowler. In corroboration of the evidence of Mr. Nicholls, (which was quite needful,) we have the master and the waiter of Reid's hotel, who tell you that for the purpose of meeting together at that hotel, Mrs. C. pretended to be, and was supposed by Mr. Reid and his servant to be the wife of Dowler; and that he should not otherwise have suffered her to come into his house. Upon a review of the conduct of Nicholls, respecting the letters of Mrs. Clarke; I am not uncharitable in doubting, whether she ever told him she was a widow. That he did not believe her to be Mr. Dowler's wife, he has convinced us. As to what passed at Reid's Hotel, when the question is, whether we shall or shall not believe Mrs. C, it amounts in my mind absolutely to nothing. I am speaking only for myself, other gentlemen have a right to think differently from me, but if this were a case of life and death, I should leave this sort of contradiction wholly out of my mind, So help me God! Sir, I perceive marks of surprize in the countenances, and I hear it testified by the acclamations of the gentlemen on the other side of the house, at what I have now said. I am speaking only for myself, and showing how my mind has been, brought to the belief of the facts alledged. I will repeat the sentiment: and I declare, that the evidence given by Nicholls, Reid, and his waiter, all put together, would not weigh one feather with me, in a case of life and death, towards inducing me to disbelieve the testimony of Mrs. Clarke. Let us for the sake of common sense, common candour, and common honesty, call to our remembrance the earlier period of our to how many will it have occurred to have made a wife by name, of her who was no wife at all?  185 We really ought to dispose of that point, by the bare recollection of past scenes, and the wanderings of our youthful days. As to the evidence of Mr. Few the auctioneer, the learned judge did not lay much stress upon it. Mr. Few told us, that in ordering some goods Mrs. C. talked of her late husband, and that her servant had once told him, upon his perceiving a cocked hat on the sopha, in her house, that her mistress was a gay young widow, and had lately been at a masquerade. Mr. Few not having been paid punctually, pursued her with great acrimony, he advertised and exposed her; but finally, she did, notwithstanding her coverture, satisfy his demand. Again I say, if this were a case of life and death, I would not discard the testimony of Mrs. C, upon the evidence of Mr. Few. Mrs. Clarke acknowledged that she had in moments of levity called herself a widow, and that she had once represented herself to be so to a Mr. Sutton at a court martial. Mr. Sutton was called to prove that she had sworn she was a widow. That attempt failed. Mr. Sutton's evidence did not even go so far as her own statement. She said she had represented herself as a widow. He did not re-collect that she so described herself. He rather thinks Mr. Smithies her solicitor so described her, but he is quite sure, and indeed the minutes of the court martial, where Mr. Sutton acted as deputy judge advocate, shew it, that she did not swear that she was a widow., and that no question was ever put to her, whether she was a widow or a wife. Here the whole of the case rested on the part of the learned gentleman; and from the testimony which I have examined, he told us, Mrs. C. had been so contradicted, that she was not worthy of belief. Let the house determine with what justice. Sir, the situation of those who have heard the evidence delivered viva voce by the witnesses, differs materially from the situation of such as have only had the opportunity of reading it. The demeanour of a witness, and the manner in which the evidence is delivered, may fairly be taken as a part of the evidence itself. The manner and demeanour of examiners must also be taken into the account. Harrassing peevishness on the one side, may beget corresponding feelings on the other, and witnesses may be sometimes taunted and provoked into answers, which a cool by stander may think improper, but of which the full advantage sought, ought not to be 186 allowed to those who have questioned them. I was led to the observation upon the advantage possessed by the hearers, over the readers of evidence from a re-collection of that part of the speech of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, wherein he dwelt upon the contradiction given to Mrs. C, relative to the condition in life of her husband, by Mr. Stowers. I ought to apologize to the right hon. gent, for having interrupted him, and given him the trouble to read the whole of that evidence through. But the impression upon me, that Stowers intended to apply his answer, to the last question proposed to him, ""You know nothing about the matter of your own knowledge?"" ""I do not,"" to the whole of his previous examination, was so strong, that I could not resist it. I admit that, had I simply read the minutes, I might have supposed, the question and answer cited, referred exclusively to the period of her having parted with her husband. So I must leave it. Myself persuaded that the answer of Stowers referred to the whole of his evidence; but admitting that, as it stands, the words may be limited to a part of it only; that the condition in life of Mrs. C.'s husband has, in itself, nothing to do with the question, is clear. Let it be recollected too, that in all her answers to that point, she spoke with much guard, and qualified them by a reference to what he had told her. Of all the attempts made to contradict Mrs. C, winch I have enumerated, none appear to mo, to have been successful. Some of them have triumphantly established her most doubtful, and improbable assertions. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, after stating the more general contradictions to the assertions made by Mrs. Clarke, has dwelt at considerable length and with great force upon the contradictions which are given to her repeated affirmations, that she did not desire the transactions in which she engaged, to be kept secret from the D. of Y.; and in the case of Brooke and Knight, the right hon. gent. finds two or three witnesses who flatly contradict her on this point. The right hon. gent, admits that my hon. friend, who spoke immediately after the learned judge in this debate, (Mr. Curwen) has made a very fair remark. I think the remark fair, and the argument which arises out of it, unanswerable. It is this. Such injunctions to secrecy were utterly inconsistent with the story which she  187 told to these persons, of her being able to obtain the favours for which they paid her, by means of her influence over the D. of Y. only; and that to pretend that all this must be kept from the D. of Y., was to mar her own plot, and to declare her own inability to perform her engagements. The right hon. gent. has not been able to get over that remark. After all the labour he has bestowed upon it, it remains in the force it originally possessed: proving that the witnesses cited by the right hon. gent. must have mistaken general injunctions of secrecy, for such particular cautions respecting the Duke himself, as the words did not imply. Dr. Thynne tells you that she talked a great deal about secrecy, and the danger of the affair transpiring. ""Whether she meant the secret to be kept from the D. of Y. as well as the rest of the world, Dr. Thynne says is, to him, mere matter of surmise. Mr. Knight says that Mrs. C. expressly told him that she had applied to the D. of Y., on behalf of his brother, and as expressly tells us, that she wished the matter to be kept a secret, lest it should come to the ears of the Duke of York. The influence exercised over the D. of Y., nay, a conspiracy with the D. of Y. for corrupt purposes, is quite compatible with the injunction of secrecy, to which evidence has been given. Mrs. C. never could have suspected that any person with whom she trafficked, would be so simple as to go to the D. of Y., and thank him personally for favours purchased of her. Supposing, for one moment, that the D. of Y. could so far have degraded himself as to enter into a league with Mrs. C. for such bad purposes, would not the first injunction given by him have been, ""Take care whom you recommend; and above all see that you can be sure of the secrecy of the parties: for if it should once transpire, that such things are done, the whole will be at an end, and we must be ruined."" It was most improbable that Mr. Knight should address the Duke, and thank him for having, at the instance of his mistress, promoted the interest of his brother: but it was not improbable, that without such injunction of secrecy, the thing might be talked of, and come round in the most unpleasant manner to the ears of the D. of Y.: and if it did come round to the ears of the D. of Y., it is pretty evident, that it would be known to Gordon and others, and that it would be impossible to continue the traffic. The whole therefore is consistent. There is no necessity for discarding 188 one part of the evidence, to give value to the other. It all hangs together. The right hon. gent, has truly stated that Corri, and his wife, Hovendon and Sandon, all speak to this point. Corri particularly says, that about the month of July 1804, there was a great noise, that Mrs. C. desired he would burn all his papers; alledging that the Duke was closely watched by Green-wood and Gordon. Mrs. C. states a conversation (pretended if you please) to have taken place between herself, and the D. of Y., respecting a person ""who had only played with her, and come to her for the purpose of making a talk."" She admits, that she did desire Corri to burn all his papers, and might have said that the Duke was angry with her for being incautious. No deduction can be more absurd than that the ignorance of the D. of Y. must be the consequence of the secrecy enjoined. It has been proved, that besides the times Mrs. C. acknowledged to have seen Dowler, since his return from Portugal, she had passed the night with him at Reid's Hotel. Can it cannot be insisted upon, that the omission in her evidence of such a fact ought to be taken into our consideration. Is it surprizing, that a woman should have concealed such a meeting from the knowledge of this assembly? I will venture to say that such concealment would not operate to her discredit in any court of justice. But, the denial on the part of Mrs. C, and the equivocation of Dowler, on the subject of this interview, is to work wonders for the light hon. gent., and both these witnesses are to be destroyed at a blow. I crave a little indulgence for them both. The right hon. gent. here broke forth in a strain of indignant eloquence. ""Here, said he, at last, I have discovered that midnight conspiracy, in which was engendered the foul tale of Dowler's payment to Mrs. C, of her application to the D. of Y-, and of his consequent appointment to the commissariat, of a piece with all those other conspiracies against the tranquillity and fame of h. r. h."" Sir, all this is gratuitous assumption on the part of the right hon. gent., none of it is proved: and although some conversation might have passed between them, at Reid's, on the interesting topics of the day, I must suppose there were other objects in view, and that if no investigation had been on foot, the meeting would have taken place. To the credit of Mr. Dowler I shall presently speak.  189 Sir, I have detained the house thus long, labouring to set before you, in as clear light as I can, the reasons upon which I have founded my opinion, that the evidence of Mrs. C. cannot be entirely discarded, as the chancellor of the exchequer and the learned judge have contended that it ought to be. I have watched with anxious attention every step she has taken. I think I have perceived a substantial connection in the whole of her story. I have witnessed most extraordinary confirmations of her evidence from sources authentic, unexpected, and quite independent of her controul. I have said, I was moved by the parts of the eloquent pleading of the right hon. gent, last night. Since I quitted the house, every waking hour has been employed in comparing the evidence with the inferences drawn from it by those who differ in opinion from me; and the result is, not that I think Mrs. C. a witness free from suspicion, not that I think all the stories she tells ought to be credited, not that her unsupported testimony ought to go to the conviction of any person arraigned, but that there is in her a scintilla of credibility: the existence of which, with all his original prejudices, the learned judge has thought proper to deny. Whither does that lead me? Sir, I must add, that I think the presumptions are against the Duke of York. The learned judge attempted to establish a presumption in favour of his royal highness from the circumstance of the very limited number of transactions which took place, amongst the multitude of promotions. He has used a figurative expression to illustrate his meaning. If such had been the case, said he, there never would have been any want of money. The mill might always have been set to work. Sir, the house must recollect, that the wind did not always serve. Times and opportunities were to be watched. All was to be made to correspond with the routine of office. Great stress has been laid on the evidence of col. Gordon, and nothing has been said in commendation of that hon. officer to which he is not, in my opinion, entitled. His official arrangements, his unremitting and punctual attention to his duties, his integrity and uniform correctness, I admit and admire. A more perfect system of business than that which he has devised for the office of Commander in Chief has probably never been framed; and a more firm perseverance in executing that system was never known. But col. Gordon has 190 said, in his evidence, that he was not in the habit of any confidential communication with the Duke of York, except on official business. We are told, that strict injunctions were given to recommend none but proper persons. Surely, surely, if there was a connivance on the part of the Duke of York, it would be folly to say that the vigilance of twenty Gordons might not have been eluded. One circumstance of presumption against the Duke has occurred to me within these few hours, which is of some weight. It appears, that the D. of Y. was acquainted with Mrs. C. some time before she was settled in Gloucester-place. That happened in the beginning of the year 1804. Previous to that period, we do not know that there was trafficking for a single commission. The moment that expence began, began also the shameful sale of Mrs. C.'s influence. The coincidence is remarkable, and deserves to be attended to. Allow that the Duke might, by bare possibility, be ignorant of her corrupt agreements; that he permitted her interference and influence is fatally proved. The presumption is strong that he connived at her mercenary purposes, and that presumption is founded on the daily experience of human nature. Do we not see in innumerable instances the utter impossibility of stopping when the career is once begun? Pendens retinacula tendit, Instat equis auriga, neque audit currus habenas. Alas, there is no controul! With the unbounded affection he felt for this woman, is it not to be believed that he would have allowed her to take money from the pockets of officers for the pretended purpose of furthering or obtaining that which would have been equally done without her interference? And might he not have laid this unction to his conscience; that the service did not suffer? Supposing his connivance to such an extent, I deny that his guilt is of so deep a dye as it would have been, if he had been convicted of gross personal corruption. The right hon. gent. also, has endeavoured to build an argument upon the very small number of facts respecting which any attempt has been made to produce proof before this house; and he has asked whether it is not miraculous, admitting the connivance of the D. of Y., that no more than the few cases stated should have come to light? I would ask in return, whether it is not much more miraculous that a private individual like my hon. friend,  191 who so courageously and at such imminent hazard to himself, has charged the son of his sovereign, a man for fifteen years past Commander in Chief of the army, with all the means which his station has afforded him to form an extensive party of friends and supporters indissolubly attached to his interests, should have been able to prove one charge, than that many should have; escaped detection? What effect could a wretch arraigned at the bar of a court of justice hope to produce upon a jury, by telling them that the fact charged and proved ought not to be believed, because his opportunities of committing the same sort of offence had been numerous, and none other had been brought home to him. It never could be accepted as a defence to say, the theft of a shilling, proved upon the prisoner, is not true, because he might have stolen thousands, and he has not been detected in so doing. The single offence subjects the convict to the penalty of the law: in suffering the punishment affixed to it, all his misdeeds are expiated. From miracles, the right hon. gent. descended to possibilities. Is it possible, said he, that the D. of Y. should have so conducted himself? Time was, that I asked that question. But, we have here before us, [holding up the evidence] with sorrow and deep regret I say it, damning proof of the fact. Let me not be misunderstood. I do not believe that the D. of Y. was guilty of so base and foul a crime, as that he pocketed or coarsely partook of the wages of iniquity; but I cannot disbelieve his privity to the existence of corruption. Is it possible the D. of Y. could have defied her if he had not been conscious of his innocence? So should I have said heretofore. Extraordinary instances of blindness have since been developed. In 1808 Mrs. C. wrote to the friend of the D. of Y. soliciting the payment of her annuity, and in default declaring that she must publish. Who, that had committed even the follies proved, would not have thought an oblivion of them cheaply purchased by the payment of a stipulated annuity of 400l. a year? Yet the D. of Y. defied this publicity. A volume of nonsensical letters might have been put forth to the world, which he and his friends would afterwards have given the world to have retrieved. Yet this serious risk was incurred. Might not others more serious have been ventured? Sir, as considerable stress had been laid upon, the profuse expence in Gloucester 192 place, and the inadequacy of the means, afforded by the D. of Y., for its supply, the right hon. gent, was provided with a statement, from authority, of the sums of money paid and the valuables furnished, by h. r. h. I do not question the accuracy of the statement made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, but I must remark upon it, that the only effect it can have is, to confirm the testimony of Mrs. C.: for it corresponds with her account, almost to a fraction. It by no means accounts for the mode in which the expence of that establishment was defrayed, even so as to have kept it on from day to day. The learned judge, in order to account for the insensibility displayed by the D. of Y. to the inadequacy of the supply afforded by him, when compared with the extravagant outgoing, favoured the house with au anecdote, neither curious, nor valuable. He informed us, that more than forty years ago, he was told by one of the preceptors of the young princes, that though they were quick at learning; though it was easy to teach them Latin, or Greek, or arithmetic, he could not teach them the value of money. The learned judge, I suppose, argues that such incorrigible ignorance has grown up with them, and therefore this Duke of York stands excused. That princes understand such subjects less than other men is too true, we have had much experience of the fact. Restricted, as royalty unhappily is, from all equal intercourse, and associations with mankind, it is not possible princes should have notions so correct upon some matters as those who are born to inferior, but not less enviable stations. But, sir, when we recollect that at the period alluded to by the learned and honourable member, one of these princes was only seven, and the other only five years of age, we shall not be so much surprized at their want of comprehension in a matter wherein all knowledge must be derived from experience; as we should have been, had we been told, that the royal children had imbibed any thing like a correct or definite idea upon it. It would indeed have been a prodigy of acquirement. I have listened, in common life, to a child of about the same age, inquiring what could be the use of money, of which he had heard so much? For his part, he could not tell why people wanted it. He had every thing for his use and amusement without it, he did not want money. Of what good could that be? Forty  193 years have since passed over the head of the Duke of Y., and have they brought with them no additional information, and no experience? It may be thought that he ought to have had some knowledge of the value of money, at the time he accepted the office of Commander in Chief. It is not an office, in which the pecuniary transactions are extensive, but such ignorance as the learned gentleman would attribute to the D. of Y., is not consistent with a due performance of his duty.   From pecuniary embarrassment, he might have derived a salutary lesson. To say that he did not know the value of money is but a weak defence against the strong presumption created, by what is proved to have happened in Gloucester-place. When he sat down to the exquisite dinners, and saw the retinue of servants; the carriages and horses, the lavish profusion in every way, and knew how slender were the means he contributed towards the expenditure, I think it absolutely impossible that his suspicions should not have been excited. When, amidst boundless waste, he heard perpetually of distress, when the applications of creditors were incessant, and he knew that he but rarely afforded any relief from their importunities; when things occasionally came to such a pass, that the woman he adored was compelled, in order to procure a temporary supply, to part with her jewels and other ornaments; to divest herself of the dearest objects of her vanity, when these pledges were again redeemed: carriages, horses, expences of every description renewed; unceasing clamour, no money ! yet the establishment not broken up ! Is it possible that under such glaring circumstances, the D. of Y. could be blind to the fact, that the recommendations she presented to him, were the sources whence she drew the means of continuing her wasteful but tottering establishment? Had Mrs. C. applied only in favour of her relations, and known friends, his suspicions might have slept. Had she intreated him to promote a brother, that would have caused no alarm. If with a gentle rebuke at the application, and a request that it might not be repeated, the man had been promoted, I do not think much blame would have been imputable, and a meritorious person might have been placed in the army. But, when the D. of Y. saw, that applications were daily, and hourly, made on the behalf of persons with whom Mrs. C. had no family alliance, 194 for whom she could feel no warm interest, and with many of whom she could have no justifiable acquaintance, can it be believed, by any rational man, that he was not only ignorant, but unsuspicious of the existence of corruption? Col. French! Capt. Sandon! were these the friends of Mrs. C.? Perhaps, however, the proof of her interference, on their behalf, will not be admitted. But, gen. Clavering ! In whose case Mrs. C. has the confirmatory testimony of the D. of Y. What friendship, acquaintance, or connexion, could be supposed to exist between her and gen. Clavering? The Duke must have known the tie between that officer, and his mistress, was to be the same as that, which connected her with the rest of the crowd of candidates for her favour. Gen. Clavering has told us that he offered Mrs. C. 1,000l. for her influence. Look at the character of the letter from Sandgate, of the 24th of August, on the subject of Clavering. Is there any surprize expressed? does he rebuke her for her application? On the contrary, in terms of the fondest endearment he tells her, ""Clavering is mistaken, my angel! in thinking any new corps are to be raised, you had better therefore tell him so, and that you are sure there will be no use in applying to me."" Is not the inference clear, that if Clavering had not been mistaken, but had applied for anything which could have been granted, her application would have been useful. Does not this expression go a great way to confirm that part of Mrs. C.'s evidence, where she says, ""if the applications were improper, he told me to say I could not interfere, without saying I had mentioned the matter to him."" But, supposing it possible that the D. of Y.'s suspicions might not have been awakened by this, added to the other and indiscriminate recommendations of military men, what shall we say, when she stepped beyond that profession; to her application in favour of Dr. O'Meara? upon what plausible footing can that be put? How came he acquainted with Mrs. C.? What was the bond of union between them? The Doctor had his credentials; a general letter of character addressed to himself, from one of the highest dignitaries of the church of Ireland, the archbishop of Tuam. A reverend doctor of the church, with a character from an archbishop, skulking and watching the door of the mistress of the D. of Y., soliciting and cringing for ecclesiastical preferment at the feet of Mrs.  195 C.!!! How did he win her good graces? What entitled him, or could, in the opinion of the D. of Y., have entitled him to the letter of recommendation, which Mrs. C. told us she gave to Dr. O'Meara? which fact is confirmed by the letter of the D. of Y. himself. Again, in that letter, does he express any surprize at the recommendation? Does he hesitate about the course he shall pursue? No. The thing requested by the Doctor, in consequence of her introduction of him, is set about. ""The Doctor wishes to preach before royalty. If I can put him in the way of it I will."" It is afterwards accomplished. What a recommendation! What a subject! What a profanation of the pulpit! Whoever, after a due examination of this case, can believe that the D. of Y. thought all the recommendations of Mrs. C. were disinterested, and gratuitous, the pure effects of friendship, must be (I was almost tempted to say) wilfully blind. I will not take up the time of the house, by dwelling any longer on this part of the subject. The circumstances which I have thus brought together, to me carry conviction. Sir, there is a case which has excited a strong sensation in the public mind, and as it is the only one, in the view of which I agree with the right hon. gent., I the rather mention it now. It will be needless to dwell upon it at any length, but I cannot pass it by in silence. I mean the case of Samuel Carter. I sincerely wish it had never been brought forward, and it is so far from my desire to aggravate, that I should be much rejoiced, if I could mitigate the prejudice which exists upon it. The learned judge has in my opinion ridiculously overstated the circumstances of extenuation, which in the opinions of the most rigid, it must be allowed, accompany it. When the learned gent. talked of the situation of pages to the royal family, that persons of superior rank claim it as a privilege, and consider it as an honour, to wait upon princes, and applied that, to the condition of a foot-boy in the house of the mistress of the D. of Y., who is proved to have gone behind her carriage, and to have done all the work of a menial servant; it will be well if such an overstrained defence does not excite additional prejudice against the person in question; at best such reasoning can only create a smile. But, sir, take the case as it is. It does not in my mind at all operate against the D. of Y. It is not of that unseemly character of actions, into 196 which many, before upright and independent, have been betrayed, when once they have laid their heads in the laps of those Dalilahs, where so many Samsons have been shorn of their strength. The learned judge will perceive, that I do not feel it necessary to press this instance into the service, to prop a falling cause. I will admit, that it is honourable to the D. of Y.; and the Chancellor of the Exchequer has declared, that if one trait that has been disclosed, can in the slightest degree retrieve the infamy of Mrs. C.'s character, it is her conduct towards Samuel Carter. He will not be surprized, that I should go a little further, and consider her conduct towards Samuel Carter, as meritorious, and generous. The affectionate and natural effusions of gratitude, contained in the letters written to her by Samuel Carter, could not have been addressed to a person incapable of acts of kindness and humanity. Sir, I think the right hon. gent. might have added to this trait, respecting Carter, the behaviour of Mrs. Clarke towards captain Sutton, the reputed father of Samuel Carter. How severe a satire did she pass, in the short uncontradicted history she gave of the life and death of that gallant officer of artillery! He had sung to the gay, and revelled with the great; he had been the welcome guest of every festive board; the esteemed friend of princes! But when the spirits ebbed, and the voice was no longer tuneful, whilst disease slowly dragged him to an early grave, he lingered and died in poverty and neglect; a debtor to the kindness and bounty of Mrs. C. alone. Sir, I feel it a duty enjoined by every principle of justice, as well as of humanity, to express my anxious hope that nothing which has passed in this house may injure the fortune of the young man: for he appears to have conducted himself with unimpeached propriety of conduct. I should be deeply grieved if his continuance or advancement in the army should be rendered incompatible with his feelings. Speaking in this house, and looking at those who in this Country have risen to power, Nam fulgente trahit constrictos gloria curru Non minus ignotos generosis. Knowing how much the country is benefitted by open competition for honours, I may venture to hope the liberality of the British army will convince them, that, however justly the pride of ancestry may be felt, high birth is not an  197 indispensible requisite in the profession of arms. The generals of the French emperor, himself a mart of birth comparatively obscure, have been uniformly selected for their merit without regard to their extraction or former occupations. With what ability they have executed the commands entrusted to them, is but too well known throughout Europe. Sir, the former low situation of Carter would have been no impediment to his rising to the highest military rank in the army of France: I confidently hope that the officers of that of England will not deem it necessary to alter their conduct towards him on account of the early incidents of his life thus accidentally made public. (No, No, No!) I joyfully receive these symptoms of the feeling of the house. I have stated my sentiments as strongly as I could, for although the appointment of Samuel Carter shews the wide, extent of influence exercised by Mrs. C., I wish it had not become a subject of discussion; and I would ward off, if I could, all the injury he might otherwise suffer from it. In examining the case of the exchange between Brooke and Knight, it is impossible for me to persuade myself that there are not, independent of the testimony of Mrs. C., many circumstances which ought to induce a belief that her influence was exerted for the purpose of forwarding that exchange; and that the D. of Y. knew the terms upon which that influence was obtained. Sir, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in order to invalidate the whole of this case, endeavours to shew, and I will admit that he does so with success, that the account of the dates given by Mrs. C. as to the period of the application, said to have been made to the Duke of York, for the purpose of forwarding the exchange, and the appearance of the official confirmation of it in the Gazette, is inaccurate; and therefore, that no such application or interference could have taken place. Sir, I admit the premises, but I deny the conclusion. Mrs. C.'s account of the dates is erroneous, but she may nevertheless have interfered. The right hon. gent. calls for a degree of official regularity from Mrs. C., which is not, I think, necessary to render her evidence credible; and he does not take into his account the loose nature of such business; that this transaction took place between three and four years ago, and that Mrs. C. enters a general protest against an accurate recollection of days and dates. That Mr. Knight had 198 found his brother's promotion was stopped, for some reason or other in the office; that he imagined, upon the suggestion of Dr. Thynne, that Mrs. C. could remove the obstacle; that the exchange did, after Mr. Knight's application to Mrs. Clarke, proceed; that it was effected; and that Mr. Knight thought it was effected through the influence of Mrs. C. there can be no doubt. Mr. Knight has proved it: and that he actually paid her the 200l. Another circumstance, if unexplained, would go to strengthen the evidence. I mean the pencil memorandum which has been so much alluded to. The terms of that memorandum, ""Cannot be acceded to, his royal highness does not approve of the exchange proposed,"" would naturally lead any one who reads it, to suppose, that the whole matter was then at an end. But col. Gordon, whom I hold to be truth itself, has informed you, that these words did not imply a decisive and final refusal; only, that further inquiry should be made; which further inquiry having been made, and the result appearing favourable, the exchange was in the common course allowed to proceed. After this declaration from col. Gordon, I can lay no stress upon words which otherwise would have appeared to me so important. They were written by colonel Gordon, and intended only for his own information. They can be properly construed by no one but colonel Gordon: as the hieroglyphics which I have in my hand, whereby I have noted such parts of the speech of the right hon. gent. as I wish to remark upon, can be understood and explained only by myself who made them. There is a minute circumstance which merits observation. Dr. Thynne tells us, that he gave in the names of Brooke and Knight, with an account of the exchange desired, upon a slip of paper to Mrs. C. Mrs. C. informs us, without any attempt having been made to shew a conspiracy between her and Dr. Thynne, or her knowledge of what Dr. Thynne had said, that she gave the Duke of York the slip of paper delivered to her by Dr. Thynne after dinner. Mrs. C. says, she received the compliment in a bank note of 200l., which note she shewed to the Commander in Chief; and, ""she thinks she got it changed by one of his servants, through h. r. h."" The right hon. gent. has bestowed a great deal of labour upon this part of the evidence. He has assumed more than is the fact.  199 Mrs. C., you will observe, thinks only that she got the note changed by one of the D. of Y.'s servants. The right hon. gent. argues as if she had all along positively asserted it. Then Ludowick Orramin was called to prove that he was the only one of the Duke's servants who ever attended in Gloucester-place; and that he never, upon any occasion, got change for a bank note whilst there. I think it quite clear, that he did not get change for the bank note in question; but, from subsequent testimony, it appears to me equally clear, that his memory fails him as to his not having got change at any time for any note. Sir, there is a troublesome witness in this part of the case; one David Pierson, whom it became necessary for the chancellor of the exchequer and the learned judge to remove before they could make their way. To knock his brains out was impossible. He had none. But he was to be destroyed as a witness; and the right hon. gent. has thought proper to impeach his testimony, because he came to amend his evidence on a day following that of his first examination; and because, as he would insinuate, his illness was altogether pretended; and that he had concerted his second appearance with Mrs. C. Sir, of all the preposterous suppositions that ever were hazarded, that of a conspiracy between Mrs. C. and David Pierson, appears to me to be the most so. Why, Sir, the whole evidence goes to disprove the possibility of a conspiracy, if such a thing had been pre-supposed. Sir, I am simpleton enough to believe, that Pierson did labour under the infirmity which he has stated the first time he was called to the bar; that he did then forget the circumstance of his having been sent to get a large bank note changed, and that, what he afterwards told you, of his having been sent to get a note of considerable value changed, and that he did get it changed at some one of the places he mentioned, is true. The right hon. gent. has asserted, that Mrs. C., after the examination of Ludowick, shaped her evidence so as, in some degree, to make it meet his, as well as to introduce the second evidence of Pierson. I believe that whatever opinion may have been formed of Mrs. C. in other respects, no one takes her to be a fool; and yet, if the assertion of the right hon. gent. be true, she must be one of the most foolish women that ever lived. Look at the way in which she introduces this second evidence of Pierson. This cunning contriver of 200 the conspiracy tells you, that she had seen the person, who is supposed to have conspired with her, for the purpose of imposing upon the house in a second examination, a confirmation of a story, which she had previously told, (of a bank note for 200l. having been changed on a certain night from Gloucester-place;) but that he, when called upon, would not confirm her allegation. He would say ""that it was a note for 50l., and not for 200l. as she had stated, with which he was intrusted, and for which he actually did get change."" (Afterwards, at your bar, he said it was a bank note of 100l.) This is to tell you, in plain terms, I have endeavoured to suborn a witness, I have endeavoured to effect a conspiracy with a person to support a part of my evidence against the D. of Y., and my associate will not bear me out in my allegation. This is not all. The witness returned, and the right hon. gent. would have you believe, that Pierson was not only asked by Mrs. C. to be, but was, a party to the conspiracy. He was far too dull and stupid to be selected by her for a conspirator. Sir, the conspirators do not agree in the same story even in their examinations in chief, to which any dolt might be tutored; and yet the Chancellor of the Exchequer is convinced, that the second evidence of Pierson is the result of a conspiracy formed between him and Mrs. Clarke. I do not apply myself to the reasoning of the learned judge on this part of the case, who has palpably mistaken Pierson's evidence.  The disjointed nature of the evidence on this case disproves a conspiracy; and I put it to the good sense and candour of the house to decide, whether Pierson is, or is not, what I believe him to be, the witness of truth. Sir, the result is, that an exchange had been negociated between Brooke and Knight, and was stopped; that Mrs. Clarke's good offices were solicited; that the exchange proceeded, and was completed; that the stipulated sum of 200l. was paid to Mrs. C. for her supposed interference; and that, on the night of the D. of Y.'s departure for Weymouth, a large bank note was given to one of the servants of Gloucester-place to be changed, and was changed. So far, independent of the testimony of Mrs. C. Upon her evidence depends, taken together with all the confirmations it has received in various points, whether the D. of Y. listened to her interference, and knew of her receiving a pecuniary recompence. By my vote  201 I shall decide what I think upon these points. Having attempted to destroy this fabrication of an under conspiracy in the case of Brooke and Knight, I pass to the consideration of the case of major Tonyn, which has some very remarkable features. In the case of Tonyn, all the official transactions were conducted with perfect regularity. No clue whatever was afforded to the detection of any improper proceeding, which the keenest eye, or the most suspicious jealousy, could take up. All was, according to the expression of the right hon. gent., demonstrably uniform, regular, and official; and yet, that Mrs. C.'s influence was sold, and exerted; and, that it was recognized by the Duke of York, is, as demonstrably certain. The prejudices of the right hon. gentleman, which he faintly suspects may disable him from forming a correct judgment, can alone have led him to assert that this case is utterly destitute of every thing which can constitute a charge against h. r. h. Notwithstanding the characters of Donovan and Sandon, the only witnesses to the preliminary part of this case, I think it has not been disputed, that the influence of Mrs. C was sought, through the medium of Sandon, by Donovan, for the purpose of forwarding the promotion of capt. Tonyn; and that the sum of 500l. was actually paid by major Tonyn upon the accomplishment of his wishes. I will just notice that Sandon, who has told you, that he paid several sums of money to Mrs. C. on his own account, and that of col. French, but believed that both he and French had been duped by her; for that, in fact, she had no such influence as she pretended to have; (capt. Sandon was always incredulous upon this subject, and had communicated his incredulity to col. French!) did, after that transaction, bargain with Donovan to procure that influence which he did not believe to exist, and received a valuable consideration upon the performance of that which he declares it was not in Mrs. C.'s power to perform. Sir, I allow it to have been proved, that on the 27th of June 1803, gen. Tonyn, the father of capt. Tonyn, and the commanding officer of the regiment in which he served, did recommend his son to the Commander in Chief for a majority; that capt. Tonyn did present a memorial to the same effect in March 1804; and that an official answer was returned by col. Clinton, saying, that his application should 202 be considered on a favourable opportunity: that, in August 1804, an augmentation did take place of 50 battalions, and that Tonyn was then appointed to a majority, together with 52 others, whose names appeared in the same gazette. It must, however, be conceded to me, to have been as fully proved, that major Tonyn believed the influence of Mrs. C. would expedite his promotion; that he deposited 500l. in the hands of Mr. Gilpin, a very respectable army clothier; and at length, that on being gazetted, he was so well convinced the influence he had intended to purchase, had been efficacious, that he actually paid the money: having, in the interval between the deposit and the final payment, threatened, on account of the delay, to withdraw it. In this case we find the mysterious note which has been mentioned by the right hon. gent. and the learned judge. It has been swelled into a size and importance which by no means belong to it, by the manner in which it was originally announced; by the extraordinary circumstances attending its production, and by the fruitless attempts which have since been made to invalidate it. I believe it to be genuine. Sir, I was one of the depositaries of the secret, that such a note had existed, and from the manner in which the communication was made to me, by my learned friend Mr. Adam, I thought the note was as dead as Homer, and so I am sure did he. I therefore waited patiently for the moment, at which the friends of the Duke should deem it most convenient to disclose the conduct of capt. Sandon to the House: and my only duty was, to watch that such disclosure was at some time or other made. The Chancellor of the Exchequer selected the time he thought the most opportune. I have since learnt, with great astonishment, that before he entered upon his narrative, he was given to understand the note was still alive. I have to complain of the right hon. gent. that he did not explicitly state the fact, of which he had become possessed, to the House: and that he stopped short in the examination of capt. Sandon, at the very point where it became the most necessary to press him. Where the right hon. gent. paused, I took up the examination of the witness. Suspicion had been excited in my mind, by the tenour of Sandon's answers, that the note was still in existence. I intimated those suspicions to the right hon. gent. across the table. My attempts to extract the truth, were followed up by  203 my learned friend (sir Samuel Romilly); and at length the note was extorted from the reluctant witness, by the hand of power. Sir, I impute not any sinister motives to the right hon. gent.; I am bound to believe that he acted with perfect purity. But I think his judgment failed him, when he withheld from the house the information he had then recently received, and when he stopped in the examination of capt. Sandon. At length the note was produced. Having heard that the D. of York had protested before God, that he had never written such a note, that it was a base forgery; and relying on that solemn protestation, I looked at the paper with the greatest jealousy, and my impression at the first view was, that it was forged. I looked at it again, and I altered my opinion. I have since examined it repeatedly. I have heard the evidence which has been produced upon it, and I firmly believe it was written by the Duke of York. The examination of col. Gordon to the handwriting persuaded me it was the note of h. r. h.; the evidence of general Hope strengthened that persuasion; that of my learned friend Mr. Adam put it beyond all doubt. An extraordinary course was then pursued by the house, in recurring to evidence of less value; after the hand writing of the D. of Y. had been proved, by the witnesses the most competent to decide upon it. The gentlemen from the Bank and the Post Office were brought before you. A species of testimony which would not, according to the rules at present observed in the courts (Mr. Nesbitt tells you such examinations have been discontinued) have been admitted, elsewhere. Their evidence all tended to confirm, if confirmation had been required, the direct evidence; except that of Mr. Nesbitt: and he closed a long examination, in Which he was convinced that the note was not of the D. of Y.'s writing, by telling us 'that he felt himself an incompetent witness to such kind of examinations; because his constant practice has been with regard to signatures only.' The testimony of Mr. Bliss was very curious. He would have had no doubt on comparing the papers, of the note having been written by the D. of Y., if he had not seen Mrs. C.'s hand-writing in some other letters lying upon your table. An observation manifestly arising out of a prejudgment of the case, in consequence of the assertion known to have been made by the D. of Y., that the note was a forgery. 204 After all this evidence, can I believe my ears? Did the learned judge really say, in the sight of Heaven, that he entertains doubts as to the genuineness of the note? In the case of life, liberty or character, would he, in the discharge of his judicial functions, discard this writing as spurious? He does still doubt. Then, neither if one were to come from the dead could he be convinced. It was reserved for the right hon. gent. to lay any stress upon such rubbish, as the evidence of Town: whom I think it was disgraceful to call. To believe it possible that Mrs. C. should, without any circumstance leading to it, inform a man with whom she had no acquaintance, but as a drawing master, that she could forge the signature of the D. of Y., and immediately set about it, in his presence, requires more credulity than I am possessed of; especially, when Mr. Town acknowledges that she wrote nothing but the signature; and that he does not know which of three distinct words that signature was. The right hon. gent. has spoken with bitterness, of the avowal made by Mrs. C., that she could imitate the hand-writing of different persons, and that she had frequently amused herself by so doing: building upon that avowal alone, a presumption, that Mrs. Clarke herself was the authoress of the supposed forgery. No part of the examination of Mrs. C. touching this matter, has impressed me with such a belief. It was not with the infamous audacity ascribed to her, that she boasted at the bar, of her power to imitate the writing of different hands. She did indeed, upon a very pointed examination, acknowledge, that she had in sport tried to imitate the hand-writing of others; and she treated the questions then put to her in a manner, not entirely unmerited; but the inference, drawn by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, is unjustifiable. She, in common with every subject of the realm, has a right to be considered innocent, until she is proved to be guilty. The ground was shifted at one time, and the guilt of forgery was to be laid upon capt. Sandon: that did net succeed. The conduct of capt. Sandon is, I think, easily explained. He intended, in the first instance, to favour the Duke of York, by withholding the note. If he had succeeded in his plan, hereafter, the note would have been produced; and compensation no doubt would have been expected for service done and performed. I cannot forget the striking passage in the  205 statement, made by col. Hamilton, of what passed between him and Sandon. Although capt. Sandon could not bring them to his recollection, I have no doubt of his having uttered the words, ""The note is destroyed, and they have forgotten it."" Evidently showing his belief in its authenticity, and describing the party, which he intended to benefit by his conduct. Sir, after all I have said, I have a right to argue upon the note as genuine. Granted, says the rt. hon. gent. for the sake of the argument! what then is proved? how does this note connect itself with Tonyn's transaction? where does it dovetail in? I confess, I am at a loss for the meaning of the note. I do not see any part of the proceeding, with which it can be made exactly to tally: but because we cannot find a place which it fits, are we therefore to exclude it altogether from our consideration? The right hon. gent. cannot seriously hazard such advice. By this note, it is, in another instance, substantiated that Mrs. C. did possess influence over the mind of the D. of Y.; that she did interfere in military promotions; that the Duke did write to her in more cases than one of that nature. For the D. of Y. to allow of the interference of Mrs. C., there could only be one of two motives, a connivance at the corruption of his mistress, or a desire to flatter her, and court her favour. But did he not, at all events, sanction her corruption, by abandoning himself to the blind infatuation of the love he bore her. Human nature has been always the same, under the influence of that fatal passion. With unresisted might, the monarch reigns, He levels mountains, and he raises plains; And not regarding difference of degree, Abas'd your daughter, and exalted me. On the mighty effects of love it were superfluous to dwell; mankind have bowed to its irresistible controul. Mrs. C. was an adept in the knowledge of the human mind when once subdued by that passion; and she has most happily illustrated the state of the lover, in the sprightly device, mentioned by the gallant officer (col. M'Mahon) in his note which was read the other night. Cupid is represented riding on the back of an animal, not more celebrated for his patience than his obstinacy; with this inscription; Tels sont mes sujets. The Case of Tonyn, so far as it goes, in proof of the sway exercised over the Commander in Chief by the object of his 206 affection, is conclusive. The whole world, with the right hon. gent. to lead it, cannot overthrow the facts. How far the connivance of the Commander in Chief, at the corruption practised by Mrs. C. is in my opinion satisfactorily made out in this Case, also, I shall by my Vote hereafter decide. Sir, the right hon. gent., throughout the whole of his able speech, was fighting with a two-edged sword; every argument he used, every position he took, might, by a person of ability equal to his own, be successfully turned against himself. If I possessed talents equal to those of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, with his own weapons I would cut him to pieces. Mrs. Clarke said, that she had no re-collection of the existence of this note. The right hon. gent. presumes that she is guilty of a base falsehood, and tells you it is impossible she should have forgotten it. I will not be so uncharitable towards the witness. I believe she had the note from the D. of Y., and that she did forget its existence. I will not even be so uncharitable towards the D. of Y. as not to suppose it may have been written, and forgotten by him. I will not be so bold as the right hon. gent. and for the purpose of strengthening my case, brand any person with infamy, upon the presumption of a recollection unsupported by the experience of my own imperfect memory. The right hon. gent. must be now aware, that if he disbelieves the evidence of Mrs. C. as to her want of recollection in this matter, he justifies those who, being persuaded of the authenticity of the note, disbelieve the solemn asseveration of the Commander in Chief. Sir, I have before adverted to the demeanour of the witnesses at your bar, and I cannot help recalling the recollection of the house to the conduct of Mrs. C. upon the memorable occasion of the production of this note. Were you in the house, Sir, at the time the committee were engaged in that part of the investigation? if you were, you could not fail to be an attentive observer of that interesting scene. You must well remember how positively she had denied the possibility of the existence of such a note; the confidence with which she declared that she never could have given to any one, a paper in the D. of Y.'s hand-writing. After the house was in full possession of all the case, the note itself being upon your table, she was again called in; her denial was fixed upon her by every probing question which the ingenuity of a cross-examiner could devise.  207 She was put a la question, and, the scene having been wrought to the highest pitch, the paper was put into her hand. A breathless expectation was entertained of her total discomfiture. We were all ready to exclaim, Quousque tandem abutere? What was our disappointment and surprise, when, with unruffled composure, and a simplicity which could not be feigned, she said, the note was in the D. of Y.'s hand-writing, and must have been in her possession. Sir, I think you will agree with me, that this could not have been acted. For one, I was ready to exclaim, as I am now ready to assert, Truth upon my oath! The case which I shall think it right next in order to advert to, is that of col. French's levy. Here again recourse is had to the old, and only expedient for acquitting the Duke of York, and the direct witness to the fact is to be destroyed. That witness is Miss Taylor. She was subjected to a long and severe examination from Several honourable and learned members of this house, and for her cross-examination the powers of the learned gentleman over against me (the solicitor general), were reserved. He had acted more as prompter during the former part of the enquiry; but upon this occasion he made his appearance on the stage. He suddenly came amongst us like a sportsman mounted upon a fresh horse towards the close of a chase. He drove away at a furious rate: but his career, like that of many a sportsman in the same situation, was soon stopped by a most disastrous tumble. A slight mistake was committed. Unfortunately no previous enquiry had been made into the nature of the testimony which was to be given by the witness called to contradict Miss Taylor. The learned gentlemen would hardly conduct themselves in other places with that degree of indiscretion which they have manifested in this. I suppose they generally inform themselves what their witnesses will say. By omitting such precaution in this case, they have brought themselves to signal disgrace. My hon. friend was accused in the early part of these proceedings, of having had too much intercourse with the witnesses whom he called; and a good deal of stress has been laid upon the embarrassed answers given by him to questions put with so much asperity and hostility, as was well calculated to disturb the recollection, and confuse the mind of a member of parliament not very conversant in matters of business. It is the only 208 way in which I can account for the sort of answers given by my hon. friend: but of this I am sure, that it was his duty to extract from the witnesses, before they appeared at your bar, every thing they could say when placed there; and therefore, that he could have no desire of concealment. The prompt avowal of constant communication was the most honourable to him, and the most consistent with his duty to the house. I charge the right hon. gent. and his learned associates, with not having sufficiently informed themselves of the value of the evidence of the witnesses which they have produced. If they had, I think Dederick Smith would never have been called. He, I will venture to say, and I will presently prove it, has not invalidated, but confirmed Miss Taylor as a witness. The experience of gen. Clavering ought to have been a warning. By his friends, and not by his accusers, the case has been set up against the D. of Y. My hon. friend ventured to sea in a skiff; he has been placed on board a man of war. His r. h. must unfortunately abide the consequences of their indiscretion. When the testimony of Miss Taylor is pronounced by the right hon. gent. to be unworthy of credit, on what foundation does that serious and cruel imputation rest? why, truly, on this for one: that the father of Miss Taylor has passed, and been commonly known by the name of Chance, as well as that of Taylor, of which circumstance she has denied any personal knowledge. On this single ground, if there were no other, or rather on this single presumption, (for there is no proof of the fact), the gentlemen on the other side of the house are bold enough to assert, that she is not entitled to be believed. This, sir, had I not actually heard it, I could not have believed. It is necessary to examine the ground of this utter annihilation of her testimony. I have stated the charge, let us proceed to consider how it is supported. In her examination, the mildness of which cannot yet have been forgotten, she was asked, 'Do you mean to state that you never heard any body call your father by the name of Chance?' She answered, 'No, I do not think I ever did.   Have you a doubt about it? None.' Then, sir, the learned gent., (the solicitor general), collecting himself in his might, with that importance and solemnity which I have experienced when he wishes to dive into the very soul of a witness, and with those awful tones  209 which have penetrated me upon other occasions, addressed this young woman, 'Then you mean to state that he has always passed by the name of Taylor. To the best of my knowledge.' 'Recollect yourself, whether you mean to persevere in that; that throughout the whole time you have known your father, you never knew him called by any other name than the name of Taylor.' 'Never, throughout the whole time I have known him.' 'Do I understand you to say, that during all the time you have known him you never yourself, or in your presence, never heard any body else, call him by the name of Chance? 'No, never.' To overturn the evidence so extorted from this unfortunate, and persecuted young woman, Mr. Dederick Smith was called the very next witness, and from the questions asked of him by the cross-examiners of Miss Taylor, it seemed as if they entertained no doubt, of removing, hors de combat, her interesting and damning evidence, without further trouble. Now, sir, for Mr. Dederick Smith. He knows the witness; he knows her mother; and he knows her father; and he knows that his name is Thomas Chance. Very well; all very glib, smooth, and plausible. Mr. Smith has bought land, which was conveyed to him by the father of Miss Taylor, by the name of Thomas Chance. By the bye, it would have been more satisfactory if Smith had produced the deed of conveyance signed by the said Thomas Chance. We might, perhaps, have found an alias; Thomas Chance, otherwise Taylor. I should like to have seen how the vendor had written his name. But he says Taylor did convey land to him by the name of Chance. This same Smith says, that when first he knew the father of Miss Taylor, and for many years after, it was by the name of Taylor. It seems, however, that enquiring for him once at the Stock-exchange, he could find no such man as Taylor; but at last he discovered whom he sought under the name of Thomas Chance. Smith was brought here to destroy the testimony of Miss Taylor. I have a right to sift the consistency of his own, and I shall not be restrained by any morbid sensibility from so doing. Smith says, 'I found out then,' that is at the time he sought for him at the Stock-exchange, 'that his name was Chance.' 'At what time did you find out that the name of this person was Chance? I cannot exactly say the time; but it was when I wanted him to do business for me 210 at the Stock-exchange. By what name did the person of whom you are speaking go, when you were first acquainted with him? He went by the name of Thomas Taylor About how long may it be, that you apprehended the true name of this party to be Chance? My memory will not furnish me with that; but it is several years ago.' Mark the extraordinary circumstances, to apply no other epithet, of Mr. Smith's first introduction to Mr. Chance. Mr. Smith, after an acquaintance of several years with a man, whom he only knew, and had never heard of, but by the name of Taylor, at last finds out, that his friend had been for years deceiving him by the assumption of a false name. His name was not Taylor, but Chance. I think the feelings of most men would have been disconcerted by such a discovery; and if Mr. Chance had, for so many years, concealed his real, under the fictitious name of Taylor, Mr. Smith might naturally have concluded, there was some strong motive for such deception. It is a circumstance very likely to destroy all confidence. Most extraordinary however it is, Smith's confidence was not thereby diminished one jot. He immediately employed his old friend under his new name, without any enquiry, to transact his business as a stock-broker, and must, therefore, necessarily have entrusted him with his property. This Mr. Chance, who, we are told, had failed, having subsequently acquired landed property, he, Dederick Smith, paid for and accepted a conveyance of that land from his old friend Thomas Taylor, under the name of Thomas Chance. I do not, sir, mean to say, that all this is impossible, but the degree of Mr. Smith's confidence is to me incomprehensible. I have dwelt upon this part of Mr. Smith's evidence so long, because it is material the house should properly appreciate the character of a witness, by whom the destruction of another witness is attempted: that the house should properly appreciate the talents of the right hon. gent. who has worked with such tools for the defence of the Duke of York. I shall now proceed to investigate the nature of the proof we have from the mouth of Smith, that Miss Taylor knew personally that her father went by the name of Chance; and that she had heard him called by that name in her presence. Mr. Smith tells us, that Mr. Taylor lived in Normanton-street and at Bayswater,  211 and he adds, during the whole of that time, I never knew him by any other name than that of Taylor, nor my family, never any of them knew him, by any other name. To the best of my knowledge he was universally known by the name of Taylor in that neighbourhood, and by no other name.' He recollects that Mrs. Taylor, (the mother) and Miss Mary Ann Taylor, called one day at his house, and that Mrs. Taylor wanted to borrow some money upon a security which she had with her. He is then asked, 'Did you state to them that Mr. Chance was coming to your house that morning? I did  Did they know him to be the person you knew as Mr. Taylor? Yes.' (Mark, how positive.) He was then asked, 'Did Mary Ann Taylor make any observation upon your stating that Mr. Chance was coming? She laughed, and said to her mother, we will say we only paid Mr. Smith a morning visit.' This was again put to him with some slight variation. 'What did Mrs. Taylor and Miss Taylor, or either of them, say or do, in consequence of your telling them Mr. Chance would be there that morning? Miss Taylor told her mother, we will tell my father (I think, I won't be positive), if he comes, that we only paid Mr. Smith a morning visit. They stopped a bit, and then went away.' Here then we have in the evidence of Mr. Smith, a direct contradiction to the evidence of Miss Taylor. Had the examination closed with the question and answer last-mentioned, the purpose for which Smith was called would have been answered. Fortunately for this persecuted young woman, and for the cause of truth and justice, he did not leave the bar until two more questions had been put to him; his answers to which changed the whole face of affairs. 'Are you quite sure, when you told Mrs. Taylor and her daughter this person was coming, you made use of the name of Chance? Are you quite sure you did not say Mr. Taylor is coming? I am not quite sure; I think I said Mr. Taylor, by way of a compliment!!!' Now what shall we say of this man, who after stating positively, in answer to a question put to him, that he told Mrs. and Miss Taylor, that Mr. Chance was coming to his house; that they knew the person he so called Chance to be, in fact, Mr. Taylor, the father of the witness who preceded him, and that 212 she laughed at his saying Mr. Chance was coming? What shall we say of this man, who is to overturn the testimony of Miss Taylor, when, in his very next answer, 'he is not quite sure of having used the name of Chance at all. He thinks he said Taylor by way of a compliment?'  Thus, sir, the very foundation of that proof, which was to convict Miss Taylor of falsehood, of which the defenders of the Duke of York made themselves so certain, to which the Chancellor of the Exchequer stooped, is at once overturned by a single kick from Dederick Smith himself. The evidence of Smith, which I have already recapitulated, can only be surpassed in absurdity and inconsistency by his concluding answer. He is asked, 'Have you any means of knowing that Miss Mary Ann Taylor knew her father by the name of Chance? and if you have, what are those means? I have no means of knowing that she did. What, sir, had he no means of knowing that she knew her father by the name of Chance? Had he not told us the very minute before, that Miss Taylor laughed at his saying Mr. Chance was coming, and that she and her mother both knew him (Chance) to be Mr. Taylor.  Sir, the whole merit of Smith's testimony, if merit it can be admitted to have, is, that he has firmly rivetted that which he was brought here to disprove and to cancel. I intreat the pardon of the house for having detained them on points so minute; but as the value of the evidence of the persons brought to destroy the credibility of Mrs. C. and her conspirators, has been highly estimated, I trust I shall be excused for the humble attempt I am now making to set before you its real worth. Sir, I am at a loss to describe my feelings inspecting the active persecution this unfortunate young woman has endured from the first moment of her appearance at your bar; but, if ever there was a woman, whose case ought to call forth the compassion of the public, that woman is Miss Taylor, so far as relates to the examinations to which she has been, exposed in this house; and the imputations cast upon her character and veracity. Now it is proper I should look at the true state of the question, with respect to this alleged double name. Is there a man in this great metropolis so ignorant, as not to know, that many of those who traffic in the lottery have found their account in assuming certain appropriate and  213 enticing names, with reference to the blind goddess who presides over that annual scandal and reproach to this enlightened and moral nation. Hazard, Burne, and Co.; Richardson and Goodluck. Why not Taylor and Chance? The fact, I suppose to be, that Mr. Taylor assumed the name of Chance as a name of business, on the Stock-exchange, by which he chose to be known in his transactions in the funds and in the lottery. But can gentlemen imagine, that when Mr. Richardson retires to his family, his children or his servants would accost him by the name of Goodluck.  The opulence, long standing and established respectability of some of the gentlemen to whom I have adverted, renders it natural, that they should be indifferent to the knowledge their families may have of their addition of fictitious names; but the obscurity of Mr. Taylor makes it probable, that his assumption of the name of Chance was wholly unknown to his daughter, as it had been for so many years to his intimate friend, Dederick Smith. Smith himself gives a very substantial reason in his corrected evidence for having said Taylor and not Chance, 'It was by way of compliment to Mrs. and Miss Taylor!' He dropped the name of Chance out of delicacy to the wife and daughter. Knowing that his friend Taylor had for so many years concealed that name from him, he inferred that if the wife and daughter were ignorant of his having assumed it, the discovery might give them pain. This is the real explanation of the compliment Dederick Smith paid, by using the name of Taylor instead of Chance. So much for Mr. Dederick Smith. Of him, I take it for granted, we shall never again hear one syllable from those who brought him forward. Sir, there has been another attack on the credibility of Miss Taylor, more furious and formidable in its nature, than that which was made through the assistance of Smith. Another circumstance is relied upon by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the learned Judge, as being of itself sufficient to render her testimony unworthy of credit. The defenders of the D. of Y. have taken two strings to their bow. Upon trial, both will prove useless. The masked battery of Dederick Smith has failed. We have now to encounter the forlorn hope. Miss Taylor was brought to the bar of the house to give evidence on the charges before us. Having given that evidence, having had her feelings tortured by a com- 214 pulsory acknowledgment of domestic calamity; having answered the almost innumerable irrelevant questions, with which her temper might have been disturbed; having been sifted to the very bran for her knowledge of the circumstances, to which she had been privy, respecting Mrs. C. and the D. of Y. we are told by the greatest authorities in the house, that she is not to be believed. Not to be believed! For what reason? The accusation of Smith has been completely dissipated by himself. Aye, very true; but Miss Taylor was acquainted, intimately acquainted, with Mrs. Clarke. She was her associate and companion. Upon this important accusation I have three short observations to make. First, if Miss Taylor had not been acquainted with Mrs. C. she never could have been examined at the bar of the house; she could have had nothing to tell. 2dly, The same objection might be urged against every other person who has been acquainted with Mrs. C. (Do the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the learned Judge see, how dangerous it is to proclaim the contagion of her acquaintance; how dangerous to affix indelible infamy on all those who have been so unfortunate as to become accidentally known to that woman?) and 3dly, If Miss Taylor's acquaintance with Mrs. C. is to stamp her with discredit, was it not worse than superfluous in the right hon. gent., was it not absurd and cruel to torment a witness, who could not utter a word to be believed, with questions about Mrs. C. and Mrs. Favory, her father and her mother, about her own legitimacy, and an infinity of circumstances, which excited disgust at the time, and which appeared to have no relation to the question before us? (I said, during the examination, that whatever the appearances might be, I could not, in my own mind, decide, whether the right hon. gent. was, or was not, unnecessarily harsh towards Miss Taylor, because I did not know how far the issue might, or might not, justify the course he took. I am now ready to express my decided opinion, that the line of examination was oppressive). Those gentlemen, who now so loudly exclaim against the credibility of Miss Taylor, because she was intimate with Mrs. C., and who were amongst the foremost and most pertinacious of her cross-examiners, have betrayed some want of judgment, in bringing forward this charge after she has answered every question they chose?  215 to put to her. To have given any force to what they now assert, they should have stopped, the moment her intimacy with Mrs. C. was announced. Then it was they should have protested against her evidence. What, intimate with Mrs. C.? There is an end of you! You are not a credible witness! We shall not ask you another question. Let those examine you, who chose so to waste their time. You are intimate with Mrs. C. and we shall not give credit to one word you say. We protest against you. Had the gentlemen seized that moment, there would have been something like consistency in their conduct. Instead of acting in that manner, they called her back, and the very first question put, on her re-examination, was, Have you not said you were very intimate with Mrs. Clarke, and frequently visited in Gloucester-place? Yes. Away they then went into a long examination. Sir, the conduct of those who persevered in the second examination of Miss Taylor, after the discovery I have mentioned, either in the hope that she might contradict herself, or that something might be extracted from her favourable to the cause which they defend; and who now tell you that Miss Taylor is not to be believed, because she was intimate with Mrs. C. reminds me of the admonitory injunction of the Mock-Inquisitor in Cil Blas, to the witness whom he examined respecting the mode of life of the Merchant of Xelva. 'Recollect,' says he, you are not to say one word in favour of Samuel Simon; you are only to tell all you know against him. But, in this case, it was reversed; every thing was to be said in favour of, but nothing against the Duke of York. So long as there was the smallest chance, the remotest hope of over turning the charges, or her own evidence, by the cross-examination of Miss Taylor, the gentlemen on the other side persevered, and if any thing could have been extracted contradictory to the evidence of Mrs. C., depend upon it, we should have heard nothing of the defect of credit in Miss Taylor, by reason of her intimacy with Mrs. C. That very intimacy would have been urged to give force to her evidence. But every tortuous effort of legal ingenuity having been exhausted to take off the force of the evidence which she did give, the resource of Dederick Smith having been in vain attempted, they are reduced to this miserable, paltry subterfuge; and turning short round, they tell us, 'Miss Taylor is 216 a witness totally unworthy of credit, because she was acquainted with Mrs. C.' just as if that was a discovery of the present moment; just as if, had her evidence been favourable, Miss Taylor would not have been held up by them as a very paragon of veracity ! Sir, I really blush for those who have so inexorably persecuted this young woman; who have resorted to such shifts to get rid of these damning, facts; and who, if you would allow them the benefit of their own inferences, as I will now prove to them, to the house, and to the world, would destroy the man whom they undertake to defend. They do not see where they are going. Where is the effect of the imputation of infamy on every one, who has had an acquaintance with Mrs. C. to terminate? Miss Taylor is accused, nay convicted, on her own confession, of the inexpiable crime of having been acquainted with, protected, assisted, relieved, and harboured by Mrs. C. Gracious God ! What, sir, is no person credible who has ever kept company with Mrs. C.? Is Dr. O'Meara, a clergyman recommended by the archbishop of Tuam, one of the dignitaries of the church of the united empire, not credible because he was known to Mrs. C.? The worthy, grateful, but unfortunate Samuel Carter, is he an outcast from courts of justice, because he was protected by Mrs. C.? Captain Sutton: is a perpetual stain to be fixed on his memory; is his veracity to be eternally impeached, because he was known to Mrs. C., and by her preserved from the extremity of want? The baroness Nolleken, it is indisputably proved, under her own hand, not only kept company with, but was an intimate acquaintance of Mrs. C., Is she, therefore, not to be believed? Sir, I would ask, Did not the D. of Y. keep company with Mrs. C.? Was he not her intimate acquaintance? Was not that royal personage actually harboured under her roof? Do we not trace him into her arms? Will they then consign him with the rest to eternal infamy and discredit? Equal justice must be done, and his is the most aggravated case of all!!! Sir, the right hon. gent., in his zeal for the defence of the accused, has strangely overshot his mark. I think he must now be willing to retract all he has said, of the infamy attaching upon persons acquainted or connected with Mrs. Clarke. I have something more to say on that subject. Of all the persons whom I have named, who may justly claim belief, notwithstand-  217 ing the imprudent anathema of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Miss Taylor is the only one who has any justification for her intimacy with Mrs. Clarke. The right hon. gentleman was silent on the material fact proved, of a family connexion between the two. Miss Taylor's brother is married to Mrs. Clarke's sister. Her justification is complete. A circumstance from the existence of which such harsh and unwarranted inferences were drawn, is properly accounted for. Has it happened to the rt. hon. gent. in the course of the experience he has acquired of the world, to find, that where the path of chastity has been deserted, all communication with the sinner and every branch of her family has been cut off? Sir, I feel that the arguments used by the right hon. gentleman in this part of the case, are weak; that they do not deserve the labour I bestow upon them: but I am unwilling in such a case as this, that a mole hill should remain unlevelled. I cannot pass over the cruelty of the rt. hon. gent. towards Miss Taylor in the observations he has made upon the profession she had undertaken for the maintenance of herself and her sister. Was it not enough that her means of procuring her livelihood had been destroyed in consequence of her examination at the Bar? Was it not enough that her scholars had all left her? That her creditors had pursued her, and seized upon her goods? That she was thrown destitute and friendless upon the world without the power of doing that mischief to society which the imagination of the rt. hon. gent, created, and which his eloquence stated in terms of such gross exaggeration? Was it necessary for him to trample upon her when fallen, and to taunt with the bitterness of reproach the victim he had so largely contributed to destroy? Had she herself been shewn to have been a woman of doubtful character, the fact of her keeping a boarding-school would not therefore have rendered her unworthy of belief as a witness. But no stain upon her has been discovered: and no pains, I will venture to say, have been spared, to detect any that might have been supposed to exist. Into what inconsistencies with his general philanthropic character has the rt. hon. gent. been betrayed? Provide a Refuge for the Destitute! Build Penitentiaries wherein to place abandoned females, and thereby reclaim them to the paths of virtue! send them again forth to the world to gain the bread of industry, in the service of 218 the moral and the good! Establish Magdalen Hospitals, and associate for the Suppression of Vice! But, if you find a lowly woman endeavouring to preserve herself from infamy by habits of industry, with unimpeached propriety of conduct; should she unfortunately have any family connexion with one of immodest life, hunt her out, persecute her, hold her forth as practising a standing fraud upon the public: Ruin her, leave her no resource to satisfy the cravings of hunger but prostitution. Then you may undertake the work of regeneration; you may raise her from the abyss into which you have hurled her. She may then become a fit member of general society, capable of undertaking any of the duties of life! Now, Sir, for an examination of the evidence given by Miss Taylor, which is very short, and relates only to one conversation at which she was present, between the Duke of York and Mrs. Clarke. She says that the Duke of York told Mrs. Clarke ""that col. French worried him continually about the Levy business, and was always wanting something more in his own fa-favour. Turning to Mrs. Clarke, I think he said, How does he behave to you Darling? or some such kind words as he used to use. Mrs. Clarke replied, Middling not very well. The Duke afterwards said, Master French must mind what he is about or I shall cut up him and his Levy too."" Upon this narrative of what passed in the presence of Miss Taylor, the rt. hon. gent. has made several observations; tending to shew that the conversation itself is invented. That Mrs. Clarke is the authoress, Miss Taylor the instrument, and that not one syllable of it ought to be believed. First, he confidently states, that, at the distance of time at which this conversation is said to have taken place, it is quite impossible Miss Taylor should be able to remember it. I cannot but observe, how very unequally the rt. hon gent. treats the two witnesses, Miss Taylor and Mrs. Clarke. With Mrs. Clarke it is quite impossible she should forget, with Miss Taylor it is quite impossible she should remember. He uses them at discretion, just as it suits his purpose. He creates impossibilities both ways, which do not in fact exist: Thereby shewing that he argues upon no fixed or settled principles of reasoning, or experience; and that his conclusions are not to be accepted without the most scrupulous examination. Sir, it must be admitted.  219 that it is difficult to give a correct account of a conversation after a considerable lapse of time, and especially if it shall have passed only in our presence, and we have had no interest in it: except, there shall have been some exciting cause of an uncommon nature, such as would be likely to fix it in the memory. In this case there was such a cause, and very likely to produce such an effect. It was the Duke of York, the Commander in Chief of the army, speaking for the first time in the presence of Miss Taylor, on the business of his office. It is highly probable that this single conversation would make an impression never to be effaced. Upon that ground therefore I find no difficulty in believing that Miss Taylor might recollect every word that passed. As to the words themselves: a good deal of weight would be given to the evidence respecting them in my opinion; if I could ascertain whether they were on were not such words as the Duke of York would in all probability have used, if he had talked with Mrs. Clarke on such subjects. There are some persons with whom I am intimately acquainted, whose words when repeated I should immediately recognize, and be able at once to declare that they were uttered by such a person, without the name being mentioned. I had never the honour of being in company with h. r. h., it is therefore impossible for me to form any judgment on that matter: but there are many who hear me who are able to put the evidence of Miss Taylor to this, amongst many other tests, of its truth. The right hon. gent. again flies to the refuge of a conspiracy, and Miss Taylor, he tells us, is a witness instructed by Mrs. C. If I could allow this to be the case, again I should say, that, acute and ingenious as Mrs. C. shewed herself to be, in the sharp encounter of wits, which she so effectually sustained against the learned gentlemen on the other side, as to set them all fast; and in which she must have been so confident of her own superiority, that I think when she next wants legal advice she will not apply, as she did at the outset of her examination, to the crown lawyers: acute and ingenious as she has shewn herself, she is a very bungling conspirator, a miserable instructor of a witness. The conversation would have been more direct, or it would have been supported by others, confirming it. To me it bears the character of truth.  Sir, I have given, as I hope, a dispassionate, deliberate, and candid account of all 220 the circumstances attending the witness, Mary Ann Taylor, and of the evidence given by her. I cannot forget the general tenour of all the questions put to her, nor the last question of her first examination. The whole, I believe, has excited a feeling of great indignation in the public mind: for a credible witness and an innocent member of society has been brought to him. I can boldly say, that I am divested of all the feelings of an advocate, and that it is my wish to act in the impartial character of a judge. I do here then most solemnly declare my belief that Miss Taylor has spoken the truth. Independent of this testimony, which, if true, makes the Duke of York an accessary to the corrupt practices of Mrs. C.; (for I cannot admit of the forced constructions attempted to be put upon the words she has recorded:) the infamous Levy of col. French bears the strongest marks of corruption from the beginning to the end, and of the connivance of the Commander in Chief in that corruption. Here, Sir, we have the fact that the influence of Mrs. C. over the Commander in Chief was hawked about for sale. Cockayne informed Sandon that business in the army might be accomplished through a person who had power with the D. of Y. Cockayne introduced the parties to Corri the music-master. Corri, with a proper degree of mystery, introduced one of them to Mrs. C. Great pains have been taken to shew that Mrs. Favery was the sister of Mrs. C, that Miss Taylor was intimately acquaints ed with her; but it would have been much, more material, if it could have been done, to have shewn that some previous intimacy or acquaintance had existed between col. French or capt. Sandon and Mrs. C., to have accounted for her interference on their behalf, and to have taken out the sting from the evidence of Miss Taylor. No such thing has been attempted. Let me pause, however. Perhaps I do not sufficiently respect the urgent motives that are said to have justified the Letter of Service to French and capt. Sandon. Col. French was known to be an able recruiter; men were wanted, and men must be had. Why! we have no proof that col. French had at any preceding period rendered the essential service described to the army by his ability in recruiting: therefore no advantage can be allowed to the assertion, which I have also heard flatly contradicted. But we have had proof that all the officers opposed themselves strongly to  221 the issue of the Letter of Service. It was obnoxious to them all. Gen. Hewitt, lord Cathcart, gen. Taylor, all declared their marked disapprobation of it either in its origin or its progress; but the influence of Mrs. Clarke for a time surmounted every obstacle. The Letter of Service was signed. Extraordinary indulgences were from time to time granted. The bounties were increased, the standard reduced, the limitation of age extended: and it was not till the misconduct of the principals and their subordinates had become so gross, and the remonstrances so strong, that the one could no longer be palliated, or the other evaded, that the Levy was discontinued. True it is, as has been stated by the right hon. gent. that the first representation on the situation of the Levy in Ireland came from colonel French; but had he not felt that he was under powerful protection, would he have dared to make such a representation as he did against gen. Taylor, with his consciousness of the facts with which that officer would be able to charge him or his agents? Read the letter of quartermaster Fawcett, wherein he talks of the sermons of gen. Taylor; the sarcastic insolence with which he describes what passed at the Inspector General's office in Dublin; his sketch of the conversation which took place at the time: ""the men and the money, and the money and the men, till he was quite tired of it."" Well, indeed, might a faithful servant of the public preach about the men and the money and the money and the men, and apply the word crimp! Well might the quarter-master sicken at the words! Look at the dispute about the beating order of O'Reilly, and judge whether a support more powerful than internal consciousnes of right, was not relied upon by col. French when he made the representation! Look at the answer of gen. Taylor, and judge whether it would have been possible for the Commander in Chief to have allowed the Levy to continue for a moment after the infamous transactions stated in that letter, but for some powerful charm. The insolence of the persons employed, and their avarice; the complete failure of the engagement entered into, the frauds practised upon the recruits, and the enormous expence to government there described, could not have been tolerated unless the Commander in Chief had been bound by some spell superior to his general sense of duty! that spell was the reward of 500l. 222 paid to Mrs. C. at the outset; and the 850l. in addition, paid at various times, up to the period at which the Levy was, by the irresistible force of its own internal corruptions and frauds, discontinued. I do not mean to say, that the D. of Y. knew of the specific sums bargained for. Sir, the right hon. gent. has condescended to tell us, (he cannot hope we shall condescend to believe him) that after the statement made by gen. Taylor, ""that the raising of the men produced by colonel French, had actually cost government 150l. for each,"" the Duke of York had allowed the Levy to be continued from motives of oeconomy. This from the Chancellor of the Exchequer! The machinery had been erected at such an enormous expence; and therefore it was better to try whether it could not pump up more men for the service of the country. This is too bad! At length, however, the machine was removed to There the nuisance became intolerable. This ""able recruiter"" having upon an engagement to produce 5,000 men in 13 months, produced much less than 200 men in 12 months, each man having cost government 150l. Col. Robinson, the Inspecting Field Officer of the London district, having represented to gen. Whitelocke, ""that the conduct of the temporary Serjeants of col. French's Levy, was in every respect infamous and disgraceful to the service; and that in addition to their various crimes and irregularities, they were then actually employed in crimping for other corps, and most particularly for the additional force,"" (The men thus described are the persons whom it is stated in col. French's memorandum, it would be necessary to employ, as steady and experienced Serjeants) the Levy was at length discontinued. But in terms of mildness ill suited to the conduct of those who had engaged in it, and the representations which had been made of the behaviour of those employed in their service. Sir, I refer to the letter addressed by the Commander in Chief to the Secretary at War, dated April 16, 1805, signed ""Frederick."" Unabashed by the detection of their former proceedings, these gentlemen returned to the charge, and solicited a renewal of their Letter of Service, with a modification of the original terms; but it was too rank. Whatever might have been the disposition, it was impossible to accede to the proposal, and it was rejected. The right hon. gent, has endeavoured to shew, that because the D. of Y. ven-  223 tured to order the discontinuance of the Levy at all, he could have known nothing of the corrupt agreement by which it was brought about. Sir, I deny the inference. The Levy was continued to the detriment of the service, and the shameful waste of the public money, till its farther continuance was absolutely impossible. The disreputable nature of French's Levy had excited attention at the time. In consequence of a motion of a right hon. friend of mine (Mr. Elliott) who had been in Ireland, and had there become acquainted with the transaction; a motion had been made and returns produced to this house, which are now before me, and not till after that period does it appear that any steps were taken to put an end to so gross an abuse. The right hon. gent. asks us, whether we believe that the D. of Y. would have exposed himself to the vengeance of these men, if he had really been acquainted with their corruption. Would he not, says he, have provided for them after some manner? Sir, he might well defy them. They were themselves accomplices in the guilt. Moreover, they owed to their agent the sum of 3,800l.; a pretty effectual bridle to the licentiousness of their tongues! and after experience has shewn that it is not quite so easy a matter, as the right hon. gent. would, for a temporary purpose, represent it to be, to attack a Commander in Chief armed at all points like the D. of Y. They might have proclaimed it at Charing Cross. Would any have listened or believed? They must at the same time have been the heralds of their own condemnation. Nothing is proved; no presumption is supported by the fact so stated by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Sir, I feel the task I have undertaken, to be arduous and afflicting. I must deliver opinions which nothing but my consciousness of my duty to the public and to my own integrity, could prevent me from withholding. In that duty, however, I am determined to persevere. I do avow, then, my firm conviction, expressed without fear or hesitation, but with unfeigned sorrow, that the D. of Y. must have been privy to the corruption of Mrs. C. respecting French's Levy; perhaps without knowing the details. Of those even, from causes which I shall hereafter touch upon, it will be difficult for his friends to plead his complete ignorance. Sandon has affected to say notwithstanding he paid his own and colonel French's money in sums so considerable to Mrs. 224 Clarke, that he did not think she had any influence. Can any man believe such an assertion after an examination of the letters produced by the officer of your house from capt. Sandon's chamber, together with the Note respecting Tonyn? Is there not evidence in those letters that she gave him and French instructions how to proceed: at what hours to go to the Horse-Guards, how to be dressed? has he not told you, that he did wait upon the D. of Y. accordingly? did he not find that she was acquainted with the different official changes? when col. Clinton was to quit his situation, and when col. Gordon was to replace him in the office? Were not all these notes preserved and docketed by him? It he had found her account erroneous in any particular, would he not immediately have returned and stated, in the familiar language which seems to have been pretty current amongst all the parties concerned, ""How is this, Mrs. Clarke? You have given me false accounts. You have pretended to influence, which you do not possess. All this is a mere humbug! I must have my money back; I shall not suffer myself to be so imposed upon."" No such thing. All fell out as she told him it would. He paid the 500l. and continued to make his payments until the bubble finally burst by the misconduct of the Levy. The letters themselves bear marks of authenticity from the originality of the expressions they state to have been uttered by the D. of Y. They are of a character not easily to have been invented. I know it has been proved upon Mrs. C. that up to this very period she has sold influence she does not possess, and that she has defrauded persons of their money, and written the same sort of letters as those now under our consideration. Sir, I can answer that, by saying, that if she was drawn into the course of corruption she pursued whilst living with the D. of Y., the poverty to which she was afterwards reduced by the withholding of her annuity, may have compelled her to engage in those swindling transactions with which she is now justly charged. Here I must say, I tax myself with a degree of forbearance which I have thought blameable from the moment. I mean for not interfering in the protection of a witness at your bar, when I felt that such witness was not treated with the fairness all witnesses have a right to claim. The letters found at capt. Sandon's lodgings, were put into Mrs. C's  225 hand, in order that she might prove the hand-writing; at the same time she was strictly ordered not to read the contents of the letters. ""Say whether that is your hand-writing, but do not read a word."" Such treatment was not justifiable. I reproach myself for not having remonstrated against it at the time. She had a right to look at the contents of the letters. Many alterations, additions, and interpolations, might have been made without her knowledge. She had a right to examine and to discriminate. She however did not hesitate; she owned them all, with a fearlessness which was remarkable, although she knew not their contents, although they must deeply implicate her. and although she had guarded against their preservation as far as she could, by adding to almost every one, ""burn this as soon as read."" I do not waste the time of the house by repeating the observation I have made in the case of Tonyn; (which is equally applicable to the case now before us) that the Levy went through all the official forms. I proceed to the consideration of an important link in that chain of circumstances which seems to bind the D of Y. to a knowledge of the details of this transaction. Sir, there is a specific tangible fact respecting the memorable service of Plate purchased with a part of the money received from col. French, and the balance satisfied by the bills of the Commander in Chief. Here again the right hon. gent. and his learned friends, in their eagerness to impugn the testimony of Mrs. Clarke, completely out-stepped the bounds of prudence. The indefatigable industry with which every collateral source of information was raked through, and carefully sifted in the hope of fixing a direct falsehood on Mrs. C. has only tended to prove the truth of her assertion, and the fact appears to me to be established by circumstantial evidence as strongly as fact can be so substantiated. In her second examination Mrs. C. was asked to state any particular sum or sums which had been paid to her on account of col. French's levy. She answered without hesitation, ""I recollect. having received one sum of 500 guineas; (Bank notes making up the sum of guineas) and I paid 500l. of it to Birkett, for a service of plate, and h. r. h. paid the remainder of it by his own bills.""  Then it was we first heard of the splendid service of plate, which the right hon. gent. has reminded us, had descended, from the proud possession of a prince of 226 the blood royal of France, to that last refuge of the indigent and unfortunate, the shop of a pawn-broker; and had thence been removed by means, such as these, to grace the side board of the mistress of a prince of the blood royal of England. To dispose of her assertion as to this fact, which, independent of its general connexion with the charges against the Duke of York, had awakened feelings of the strongest interest, became eminently important; and the greatest efforts were made to overturn it. Vain attempt! Sir, had the most strenuous advocates of the credibility of Mrs. C. been employed to elicit corroborating facts by which her testimony might be supported, they could not have been more successful than were the active agents of the D. of Y. to that purpose. Unluckily for h. r. h. the pertinacious disposition which they manifested to deny every thing, had the effect of proving every thing. When Mrs. C. first asserted that she had received 500 guineas from col. French, for the exertion of the influence which she possessed over the D. of Y., the fact was denied. Then came Sandon's corroboration, which drove them out of that hold; and then Mr. Parker exhibited the account from the late Mr. Birkett's book; and in that account was seen an item of 500l. corresponding in date and amount precisely with her assertion. The ground was immediately shifted, and, from endeavouring to show that Mrs. C. had invented the story, the gentlemen demanded, where was the scintilla of proof, of the D. of York's privity? As to his having given his acceptances for the remainder of the purchase money of the service of plate, he knew nothing about the matter. True it was, that in the account produced by Mr. Parker, it appeared, that the balance had been paid in bills at various dates from two to twelve months; but it was an abominable falshood of Mrs. Clarke, to say, that these bills were the acceptances of the D. of Y. In order to sift this matter to the bottom, recourse was had to the books of Messrs. Marsh & Co., the bankers of the late Mr. Birkett; and Mr. Wm. Tyson, one of their clerks, attended with them at the bar. The evidence of this gentleman was given with some reluctance, as those who recollect it will doubtless admit. He was first asked, ""Have you got any account of checks of his royal highness the Duke of York that were sent into your house by the  227 late Messrs. Birkett of Princes-street? Not any. Being afterwards asked, You have stated that you have examined Messrs Birkett's account, and find in that account no checks whatever by his royal highness, as having passed through your hand?"" he gives the following answer, ""My instructions were to see what checks were drawn by Birkett's and Dockery in favour of Mrs. Clarke, which I have done."" Here then, was a witness from whom nothing was obtained to support Mrs. Clarke; and it was clear, that the Duke of York had had nothing to do with the payment to Birketts. The whole of this was, like the rest of Mrs. Clarke's assertions, a mere fabrication. At length, however, Mr. Timothy Dockery, who had been, first the journeyman, and afterwards the partner, of Mr. Birkett, was called to state his knowledge of the transaction; and his evidence, though very far from being willing, at once terminated the triumph of those honourable and learned gentlemen. Respecting the examination of this service of plate by the Duke of York and Mrs. C. previous to the purchase, Mr. Dockery had no recollection, and he had no knowledge with respect to the bargain. ""The bargain concerning that plate was not made in my presence."" He at that time held only the place of journeyman in the house, and therefore may have been really unacquainted with the terms of the bargain. As however, he was soon afterwards taken in as partner, it is very difficult to believe that he was absolutely ignorant not only of the real purchaser, but of the terms upon which the purchase was made. Nothing, however, on that point, could be extracted from him, and if his then master, Mr. Birkett, had ever mentioned the customer he had had the good fortune to meet with for this plate, (a circumstance in itself highly probable) he did not recollect any thing about the matter. The first thing he admitted he knew, was, that the plate was purchased from Mr. Birkett. This, as he must have assisted in delivering the plate, was no very extraordinary piece of information. As to the sum to be paid for it, he knew nothing but by referring to the book. He did not know that any part of it was sent to Gloucester-place for inspection, nor could he recollect either Mrs. C. or the D. of Y. calling at the shop for that purpose. Respecting the payments, his memory was better, ""Do you recollect any 228 thing with regard to the payment for that plate? ""Yes; 500l. was paid at the time the plate was delivered, and the remainder was settled by bills at different dates. The 500l. was not paid to myself, but it was paid, I believe, to Mr. Birkett."" ""Do you know by whom it was paid?"" ""I do not."" Thus far Mr. Dockery's testimony cast no light upon the matter, it was still involved in mystery, for the D. of Y. was still out of sight. Not a word was dropped by which he could be implicated by the evidence of this witness, any more than by that of the clerk of Messrs. Marsh and Co. At length Mr. Dockery, who had not any knowledge of the party who had paid the 500l., told the house, that the remainder was paid in bills drawn by Mrs. Clarke. There we got a step further. Mr. Dockery was then asked, ""Upon whom were they drawn?"" When, to the astonishment of those gentlemen who had been so vehement in denying the privity of the D. of Y. to any part of the transaction, Mr. Dockery answered, ""The Duke of York."" Mr. Dockery himself presented all these bills to the D. of Y. as they became due: And by the D. of Y. they were paid to Mr. Dockery, by drafts on the house of Messrs. Coutts and Co.  Thus then, the fact of the D. of Y.'s privity, was, to my mind, indisputably established: And what makes this statement dove-tail in with the whole transaction, is, that Mr. Dockery speaks to the payment of 121l., the balance of that account, by a draft of his royal highness on Messrs. Coutts and Co. on the 23d of July. The fact is clearly brought home to the D. of Y. by the evidence of Mr. Dockery; who, as I have already stated, was not a very willing witness, of which, if any proof were wanting, it may be worthy of remark, that although the D. of Y. paid him these sums of money at different payments, yet he affirms, that he cannot recollect the D. of Y. ever speaking to him at all respecting the service of plate, or any thing that he said. The right hon. gentleman feels no surprise at this. He deems it impossible to recollect a conversation which passed at such a distance of time. I am astonished that the witness cannot call to mind what passed between him and a personage of such distinguished rank in the country, upon a business so novel and extraordinary, as the one in which he was then engaged. From the evidence of Mrs. C.,  229 the corroboration of it given by Sandon, the coincidence in the account produced by Mr. Parker, and lastly, the evidence of Mr. Dockery, I believe not only that the D. of Y., as is proved, paid for the remainder of this plate, but that Mrs. C. had obtained, by reason of her influence with the Commander in Chief, that sum of 500 guineas out of which she paid the 500l. on account to Birkett; and believing that, can I doubt the knowledge of the Duke of York of the source from whence she had derived the means of paying at one time, so large a sum of money? The Duke of York must have known what was the cost of the plate, that is clear; that he must also have known 500l. on account to have been paid by Mrs. C., is equally clear; for he could not have given his acceptances for the remainder of the plate, and have paid the balance of the account, without having seen that account stated, when the payment of the 500l. would have stared him in the face, being the first item on the credit side. Now, sir, if the allowance of Mrs. Clarke was 1,000l. per annum, would not the Duke of York, if he had been ignorant of the sources from whence Mrs. Clarke obtained 500l. have taken the alarm? would not his personal feelings have been roused by such a circumstance? Sir, it is impossible that he could have been ignorant of the real nature of Mrs. Clarke's connection with col. French. This verily in my conscience I believe! Sir; We cannot help being forcibly reminded by the incidental circumstances of this case, how deeply nations are concerned in the private conduct of those connected with the monarchs appointed to rule over them. I have said, that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has called to our recollection, that this service of plate belonged to the Duke de Berri, a branch of the house of Bourbon, once so mighty and illustrious. The last unhappy sovereigns of that family were murdered by their own subjects, and the few of its members who survived the promiscuous carnage of those bloody days, driven from their native home, are wanderers on the face of the earth, or supported by the charitable munificence of this country: affording a melancholy but instructive lesson, of the near connexion subsisting between the private lives of princes and the fate of nations. It might have been expected, that the Duke of York would have started at the name of the Duke de Berri, and 230 contemplating his sad reverse of fortune, would have resolved upon such an alteration of life and conduct, as would have precluded the necessity of this painful enquiry. He might have reflected on the state to which a man of such high descent was reduced, on that surprizing vicissitude of human affairs, which had driven to such expedients for support, in the metropolis of the kingdom which had for centuries been contending against the ambition of his family, a near relation of the ruined throne of France. He might have accepted the warning thus offered. A man of sound understanding could hardly have overlooked it. Tracing effects to their true causes, he might have seen that the revolution, of which that royal house and its appendages have been the peculiar victims, and which has in its consequences convulsed the whole moral state of Europe, was brought about, not by the theories of speculative men, but by the vices of individuals, and the foul corruptions of the state: finally drawing down upon the innocent as well as upon the guilty, one universal ruin. Such were the real causes oft he destruction of the ancient monarchy of France. It has been truly said, that philosophy has no such triumphs to boast. In the national effects produced by the vices and follies of the higher orders of society, are to be found the reasons which take the matters now under our consideration, out of the private transactions of the Duke of York. It is the influence which the moral behaviour of persons of exalted rank has upon the public weal, which gives such vast importance to all they do, and makes it decisive of the fate of empires. Let us for the sake of example trace back the history of France to the La Valieres, the Montespans, the bigotted Maintenon, through the profligate period of the regency, down to the Pompadours, and the wretched du Barre, who lived to suffer in that Revolution, which was hastening to it's fatal crisis, with the velocity of a comet, unperceived by those who were indulging in their gorgeous vices. Look how the strength of France was blasted, how England flourished in her decline! When vice and corruption reigned paramount in France, was not France humbled to prostration before the power of England? To what cause but that of the weakness produced by her corruption, can that prostration be ascribed? Sir, I feel that I have dwelt at great length upon so painful a topic, but this instance of the  231 instability of all human greatness, is so striking, that I could not refrain from expressing my astonishment, that it failed to make such an impression on the mind of the Duke of York, as to induce him to abandon the course of life in which he was engaged, and to trace back his steps to the paths of prudence and decorum. At the bare possibility that his name might be implicated in deeds so odious, he might have shuddered. This magnificent and awful monument of fallen pomp and greatness, might have served for the remainder of his life, as a beacon to direct his course: and he might have thanked his Creator for his rescue from the abyss over which he hung, with a resolution immoveably fixed, thereafter to lead a life of virtue! Sir, I now come to Mr. Dowler, whose case appears to me to bear still stronger proof of the corrupt influence of Mrs. Clarke, than any of those which have been brought before us. It has been contended by the right hon. gent. that the testimony of Dowler ought to be rejected, on the ground of his having been convicted of falsehood, or at least, of his evidence having received from an hon. member of this house, Mr. Alderman Combe, such contradiction as renders Mr. Dowler unworthy of belief. This, sir, I positively deny. The substance of Mr. Combe's evidence is, That having been acquainted with Mr. Dowler, and his misfortunes on the Stock Exchange, he had heard with pleasure of his having obtained an appointment in the Commissariat, but that he at the same time heard this appointment had been obtained through the influence of Mrs. Clarke. On meeting Mr. Dowler in the street, he, Mr. Combe, being on horseback, and Mr. Dowler on foot, and separated by a press of carriages, (and as Mr. Dowler states by the unruliness of Mr. Combe's horse,) Mr. Combe congratulated Mr. Dowler on his good fortune, and asked him whether he had obtained his situation through Mrs. C.'s influence, or by the interest of Mr. Brook Watson. To which Dowler's reply was, ""Oh! by Mr. Brook Watson's."" This assertion is denied by Mr. Dowler, and indeed, if it was made, turns out not to have been true. But, sir, let us deal a little fairly by the witness, and try whether the falsehood, admitting it to have been such, is of a nature to make us reject all Mr. Dowler may ever after say as a witness. Was it an examination on oath? was it a judicial enquiry of 232 any sort? was it even a conversation of a strict and severe character? By no means, It was of that loose desultory sort, where no right existed in the one to demand, nor any obligation lay on the other to disclose, what had passed. We are told, and it is not improbable, that strict secrecy had been enjoined to Dowler. That moralist must have been able to balance himself with great success, upon the pinnacle of perfection he has attained, who can undertake to say he has never made a greater deviation from truth, than the one here ascribed to Mr. Dowler. Listen a little to Mr. Alderman Combe, and hear whether his opinion of Mr. Dowler's integrity is weakened by the circumstance to which he has himself given evidence. He is asked, ""From your own knowledge of Mr. Dowler, do you believe him to be a man of integrity? Perfectly so. I would have recommended him to any situation for which he was a candidate."" Sir, the Chancellor of the Exchequer may hold this cheap; but I have a very great value for the opinion of Mr. Alderman Combe. I believe him to be an excellent judge of mankind. I have great confidence in his tact, and I am sure no consideration would induce him to represent a man as one of perfect integrity, who, in his opinion, had been guilty of gross deliberate falsehood. The right hon. gent. thought, if he could extinguish the character of Dowler, the glaring case of the commissariat would be extinguished with it. Of Mr. Dowler there is no concurrent recommendation at all. He stands upon the influence of Mrs. C. alone. No trace has been discovered of any other support. That Mr. Dowler exercises the duties of the commissariat is before our eyes; how he became commissary, no man can tell. Every nook and corner of the treasury has been ransacked. The soothsayers have been consulted. The wise men have opened the books of the mysteries, wherein are recorded the applications, promises, and performances. A former secretary of the treasury has applied to the stores of his memory; the present secretary has carefully reviewed every paper in his possession. The universal return has been ""Non est inventus."" Mr. Commissary Watson from the grave disclaims him. Dowler indeed, himself, has mentioned one person who might have thrown some light upon the matter, but he has never been called. Mr. Dowler has said, that  233 Mr. Vernon of the treasury told him, ""I believe you are going to be appointed ""assistant commissary. I have no doubt the appointment will take place, it has been signified from the board."" Why was not Mr. Vernon, who is now alive, brought before us, to tell us what he knew about this appointment? I have no doubt that Dowler has spoken the truth. The right hon. gent. cannot do that which is impossible even to Jupiter himself. He cannot call back the past day. He cannot annul the appointment. He cannot rail the seal from off the bond. Divest Dowler of the protection of Mrs. C, he stands alone, perfectly insulated, without friend, connexion, or recommendation; yet he did obtain an appointment. He served in South America and Portugal with the king's forces, from whence he returned, providentially as it would appear, to give his testimony at the bar of this house. To the D. of Y. Dowler must have been an object of personal aversion. But the money which he produced, secured the influence of Mrs. Clarke, and her influence over the Commander in Chief secured a recommendation which was sure of success. Such is the story he has told. Circumstances strongly corroborate the statement he has made, not a shadow of contradiction is given to any part of it. I believe it to be true. I now come to the case of Mr. Elderton, who was appointed pay-master to a regiment. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has said, that paymasterships are not in the appointment of the Commander in Chief, and he is certainly right. But will the right hon. gent, pretend to say that the recommendation of the D. of Y. to such an appointment would have no influence? Mrs. Clarke applied to the D. of Y., and the D. of Y. mentioned it to Mr. Greenwood. Had that no weight? But the D. of Y. never applied formally to Mr. Greenwood on the subject, and never directly recommended him to his notice. What trifling is this! do not we all know how the matter passed? The D. of Y. said to Mr. Greenwood, ""Mr. Elderton will call upon you about a paymastership."" Verbum sat. Greenwood bowed, and the thing was done without another syllable. Mr. Greenwood had only to see the man was duly qualified. It was indisputably by the influence of Mrs. Clarke alone the appointment was obtained: and what, like many other circumstances attending this investigation, is almost miraculous, the 234 letter of thanks addressed by Elderton to the D. of Y. was produced from the repository of Mr. Nichols. Of the existence of such a letter Mrs. Clarke was utterly ignorant at the time she told her story. Sir, the right hon. gent, has endeavoured to throw some doubt upon the existence of the real influence of Mrs. C. in this case of Elderton, because the letter of thanks addressed to the D. of Y. upon his appointment was found amongst papers belonging to Mrs. Clarke, because it was not, according to technical language, in it's proper custody. Sir, is the right hon. gent, so little versed in the ways of the world, as to suppose that all papers communicated by Mrs. Clarke to the D. of Y. would be consigned to the care of some official person, and that if this letter was really written in the way, and upon the occasion stated by Mrs. Clarke, it would have been found amongst the papers of h. r. h.? No. If in the hours of familiar intercourse it was shown to him, as it most probably was, it would have been glanced over, and immediately thrown aside, with the same carelessness and indifference which Mrs. Clarke herself displayed with regard to all the important papers which at different times came into her possession. A carelessness so substantiated as to make it morally impossible she should have acted from any fixed design of vengeance against the Duke of York. There remains but one more case to be disposed of, which is that of Kennett. I should wish to go into it, but I have trespassed so long upon the indulgent patience of the house, that as it is but collateral I will dismiss it with a very short I observation. It proves to what shifts the D. of Y. had recourse for the purpose of raising money. It shews to what purpose he would have applied the adventitious influence which he possessed in consequence of his high situation. Taken with all the other facts upon which I have felt it necessary to dwell, it adds to the general mass of proof of the existence of corruption. Sir, at the outset of these inquiries, the friends of the Duke of York might have had some plausible pretence for talking of Conspiracies against him, and through him against the Royal House of Brunswick. It was in consonance with the feelings of some hon. gentlemen to speak of the existence of such traitorous designs with a pomp and solemnity which would better have become the great Roman Orator, when he divulged to the astonished Senate the  235 plot which had been formed for his assassination, the subversion of the state, and the massacre of the best men of the republic. But what is become of such Conspiracy now? We find all the reputed conspirators disagreeing and quarrelling with each other. Yet the more they quarrel the more they strengthen the charges against the Duke of York. Look at the reluctance with which Donovan, a notorious trafficker in the sale of real and pretended influence, gave his evidence. Recollect his gross prevarication on the first day of his examination. Did he conspire against the Duke of York? Did Sandon conspire against the D. of Y.? Look again, and see how these witnesses, who evidently had very different objects in view, than to oppress the Duke of York, have entrapped themselves into evidence, which has had a fatal effect in the minds of many upon the character of h. r. h.? The right hon. gent, to the last exclaims Conspiracy! and yet when he has wanted to support an argument, he has deigned to summon these pygmies to his assistance. In one case, I remember, where he was in the greatest streight, he set number against value, as if one Gordon was not worth a whole kingdom, filled with Donovans, Sandons, and such a tribe. Sir, in order to carry this Conspiracy into effect, a special interference was necessary. Dowler arrived from Portugal, and Sandon from Spain, at the very moment. I do not know whether the right hon. gent, thinks these extraordinary coincidences were brought about by the machinations of Mrs. Clarke. In my opinion the men arrived most providentially for the service of the nation, to confirm the testimony she had given. Sir, there is one part of the written, evidence which has foiled the ingenuity of the right hon. gent., and he has fairly declared that he can give no explanation of a fact, the existence of which however he does not deny. I mean that part of the correspondence of Mrs. Clarke where she talks of the introduction of foreigners into the British service. Aye, and of Catholics too! I do not imagine, any more than She right hon. gent., that Mrs. Clarke granted regular letters of service; but I apprehend that through her influence, facilities were given for raising the men described. I wonder the right hon. gent, did not take the alarm at the introduction of Catholics, that that did not strike him as one of the features of the Conspiracy. Catholics filling up the ranks of the British army! 236 Catholics sanctioned by a Royal Duke! flat Popery! Why, sir, this was paving the way for the Pope to become Commander in Chief!!! Most happy, sir, should I be to see that class of my fellow citizens restored to the privileges to which they are entitled, and of which they have been deprived by those arbitrary acts, which ought long since to have been repealed. Sir, I disregard the clamour I have excited by the expression I have just used, and I repeat it. The acts which deprive that oppressed part of our fellow subjects of their common rights, even of the privilege of bleeding for their country, but under the heaviest penalties, are arbitrary, cruel, and unjust; and if the greatness of this empire is to be maintained, they must be repealed. But, I will not now be led further by feelings which I own have strong possession of my mind. The train of reasoning used by the right hon. gent, to prove the existence of conspiracies and plots, appears to me absurd. That a Conspiracy, however, has existed for the destruction of the Duke of York, I am compelled to admit. That such conspiracy was forming by the rankest jacobins this or any other country has at any time produced, is indisputably true. Sir, it has been said, that the blood of the martyrs is the seed of the church. It may with equal force be asserted, that the follies of princes are the food of the jacobins. The underling conspirators were Donovan, Sandon, Maltby, and all that crew connected and supported by the corruptions which took their source in the Duke of York's fatal abandonment of himself. Where were the more select meetings of the chief conspirators held? In Gloucester-place. Who, unconscious of his own danger and disgrace, presided in the chair? The Duke of York. At the orgies of Gloucester-place, the genius of jacobinism displayed his fullest state. That dreadful masquervjder  There foremost at the banquet and the ball, He led the dance, and threw the deadly die: Nor ever failed the midnight bowl to crown. Gaily carousing midst his gay compeers, Inly he laugh'd, to see them laugh at him, As absent fur. Let the true method be taken, and this malignant spirit, will be quelled. Expel jacobinism from the palaces and chambers of the great, and it will no longer be found in the hovels of the lowly and the poor. My honourable friend who has made the motion which I support,  237 is no jacobin, but the true anti-jacobin, who would save the Duke of York from the fangs of those vultures and harpies who fatten upon the corruption they create. Of the publications, not to say libels, with which the press has teemed against my hon. friend, and all who in these perilous times have dared be honest, I cannot speak without contempt. If to gloss over to the public the errors of princes and the weakness of ministers,; if to jingle in rhyme, and to turn patriotism into ridicule, be the test of anti-jacobinism, then has not my hon. friend any claim to that appellation. But, if to stand forward for the relief of royalty from the machinations of a profligate crew; if to oppose the hydra of corruption, be the business of a true anti-jacobin; then is my hon. friend an anti-jacobin in the most legitimate and extensive sense of the term. In the early part of these debates it was said, by a right hon. secretary, that whatever might be the result of the Charges, infamy must fall somewhere. Sir; there was something shocking in the efforts made, and the language used, to deter my hon. friend from persevering in the difficult task he had undertaken. I would now ask of that right hon. gent., Where is the infamy to fall? That it falls upon my hon. friend no man will now have the boldness to assert. Will the right hon. gent, and the other defenders of the Duke allow that it rests upon the head of his royal highness? No. Where then is it to be placed? It must return whence it came. It is in the custody of the right hon. gent, until he shall think proper to tell us where is now its appropriate place. Sir; my hon. friend is not one of those grovelling despicable characters, who give birth to plots and conspiracies, which exist only in their own fancies, and are promulgated only for their own purposes. He is not one of those who paint in odious colours all who stand between them and their own wishes. He is not one of those most pernicious of jacobins, who would approach the throne with the fatal language of falsehood and adulation. He has shewn himself courageous, candid, and consistent; nor can any eulogium which can fall from my lips, add to the sum of his merits, or to the esteem in which he is held by a grateful country. Let the house of commons follow his example in the courageous discharge of its duty. The country totters to its ruin: but it may yet be saved. 238 Let us forthwith set about the work of Reform. Let the house of commons shew that true regard for the throne which consists in taking the measures best calculated for its preservation. That throne is the most powerfully supported which has its foundation in the hearts of the people. There fix it, by shewing to the people of England your determination to support their rights, and to destroy corruption, in however lofty a branch the canker may be found. In so doing you will act nobly by the Duke of York himself. Let the censure passed upon him by this house be remembered only as the chastisement by a parent of a beloved child, whose welfare and happiness are the only objects of the infliction. Let us by voting the address proposed avert the fatal consequences which I greatly apprehend may result from a refusal to do justice to the feelings of the country. Sir, I cannot pass over the Letter which his royal highness has been advised to address to this house. It was an act of great impropriety. I will not now say what might be urged upon the manifest infraction of our privileges; for such is the importance of the main subject of our debate, it absorbs all other considerations. It is a melancholy task he has imposed upon the representatives of the people to pronounce upon his guilt or innocence, after having solemnly pledged his word to his utter ignorance of facts to which it is charged that he was privy. Against the conviction which I feel upon this point arising out of the proofs, what can I put which ought to make the scale preponderate? The honour of a prince! Sir, what is the honour of a prince more than the word of a man? If the pledged honour of the Duke of York is suffered to have the slightest weight in our deliberations, against the evidence of facts proved at the bar of this house, there is an end at once to all freedom of discussion; all inquiry must hereafter be fruitless. There was no necessity for this assertion on the part of the Duke of York. The alternative to which we are reduced by it, is by no means honourable to him, and very miserable to us. What can avail such asseverations? the hour must come when all distinctions will be levelled by death. The innocence and guilt of all will at some time appear: but to the protestations of the accused, we must turn a deaf ear. Have we not heard wretches led to execution, with the rope  239 about their necks, on the brink of eternity, in. the last vain hope of escaping from punishment, call on their Maker to witness that innocence which could not by possibility exist. Sir, such protestations are horrible to my ear, feeling as I feel, and acting as I shall be compelled to act, when called upon to give my verdict as a member of this house. It has been confidently asserted by the right hon. gent, that the public virtue of this kingdom is now eminently conspicuous; that there never was a period of our history, when public men could with less justice be charged with corruption. If by corruption the right hon. gent. means to confine himself simply to peculation, and direct coarse bribery by money, I may be disposed to agree in the justice of his remark, but let me add the reason. A spirit of enquiry is alive. Men do not chuse to have their names recorded in the blue books which lie upon your table. Detection is more likely, and therefore we act under stronger restraints. Such things, however, have been brought to light, as render the admission I have made, doubtful in the extreme. For the rest, Corruption, by the means of patronage and influence, has been extended till it's limits have vanished from our sight. Corruption to the very core! However we may flatter ourselves, that poison, more to be dreaded than all the hostile efforts of Buonaparte, is making an unheeded, but certain and rapid progress; it hourly saps the state, and if not checked, it must speedily prove fatal. I conjure the house of commons, instantly to set about the grand work of reformation in every department. Let not a moment be lost! for in reform, temperate and rational reform, lies the only hope of salvation. We must reform, or we shall perish! Sir, I trust we shall hear no more of prosecutions for libels on the Duke of York, on the subject of army promotions. Vile and calumnious as such publications have been I hope they will be suffered to rest. After what has been seen, we know too well what foundation has been given, upon which such false and exaggerated statements have been built. Let a veil be thrown over the past. It is for the interest of the community that it should. I know that in some gentlemen there is a disposition to restrain the press. Its perfect freedom is in my opinion as essential to liberty, as the circulation of the blood to the existence of animal life. Its licen- 240 tiousness is under the controul of the law. If, then, the learned gent, shall think it right to draw the vengeful pen of indictment, let him not forget the well known pamphlet called the Plain Statement, which issued from the press in the course of the last summer, than which a more calumnious libel was never uttered, either against the Duke of York, or against the British constitution. The fact charged by the greatest characters of the present reign, that there does exist an interior cabinet, controuling the operations of the executive servants of the crown, and thwarting their measures, is there directly avowed; and the Duke of York is named as the head of that dark and dangerous cabal. If any thing calls for prosecution, it is that, the grossest of all the calumnies which have been published against his royal highness. Sir, the indulgence with which I have been heard, demands my unfeigned acknowledgments. I have laid before you my whole heart, upon this most anxious and important subject. I have delivered my opinion, fully, freely, without hesitation or reserve. If my reasoning shall at all have tended to elucidate a matter involved in much intricacy, and where the chain of evidence is difficult to follow, it will be satisfactory to me, to think that my labours may have conduced to assist in forming the opinions of others. I should, however, be unfeignedly sorry to have given a false interpretation to any thing which has fallen from the witnesses, or unduly to bias the opinion of any member of the house. I will now conclude by again calling upon the house of commons, carefully to perform the solemn duty which they owe to their constituents. In this awful crisis of our fate, the safety of England depends upon the firmness and decision with which this house shall execute its trust. The passing moment is big with danger. The plague is amongst us. Bring incense quickly. This house alone can effectually interpose: alone can stand between the living and the dead, and stay the plague!!!"	222.0	1809.0	1800	[('fair', 'fair', ['positive', 'JJ']), ('sound', 'sound',

15572	15572	S1V0019P0-01407	1811-05-08	REPORT OF THE BULLION COMMITTEE.	Mr. Canning		"Mr. Canning rose and said: Mr. Lushington; After the ample discussion which this question has undergone, I rise, Sir, not in the presumption that I am able to add any thing to the information which the Committee has already received from gentlemen the best qualified by their talents and their acquirements, by their professional pursuits and their official situations, to throw light upon the subject in all its principles and details; but simply for the purpose of stating the grounds of my own vote upon the several propositions which are submitted to our consideration. In discharging this duty a duty which I feel to be incumbent upon me as a member of parliament I beg to be considered as speaking in that character only; as delivering freely and honestly a sincere' and unbiassed opinion, upon a question so important, that I did not think myself at liberty to let it pass without forming, to the best of my judgment, some opinion upon it; as neither adopting nor countenancing the prejudices of any set of men whatever; as neither the advocate nor the antagonist of the Bullion Committee; neither the advocate nor the antagonist of the Bank. With respect to both those bodies, I firmly believe, that they have, each according to their measure, performed conscientiously a very difficult duty. Of the Bank it is always to be remembered, that the condition in which they have found themselves, has been none of their own seeking; that the original restriction, in 1779, was imposed upon them by parliament; upon their own showing indeed of their difficulties difficulties,  1077 however, arising out of circumstances over which the Bank had no controul; and that the restriction was renewed after they had declared their readiness to resume their payments in cash. Of the necessity of the first restriction I have no doubt; of the policy of the terms upon which it was last renewed I certainly entertain great doubts; but the error of that policy, whatever it may have been, is not justly to be visited on the Bank. Placed as the directors of the Bank have been by the effect of that last renewal, and by the events which have since occurred, in a situation perfectly novel; having, from the mere managers of the affairs of a great money corporation, become, by the force of circumstances, the sole issuers and regulators of the whole currency of the country; it is surely not to be wondered at that in such a situation they may have found the maxims of their original and habitual occupation either inapplicable to their new and enlarged sphere of action, or insufficient for it; and may have committed mistakes in the exercise of one of the highest prerogatives of the sovereign, which they would easily have avoided in conducting the concerns of their constituents. If they have fallen into such errors, I am not inclined to blame them. I would correct the errors, but without imputation on the men. On the other hand, I must as fairly confess that I think the Bullion Committee has been hardly dealt with in the course of these discussions. A stranger who had derived his only knowledge of the case from the debates of the two last nights,-would almost have been led to imagine that the Bullion Committee was some Strange and self-erected power, wholly extrinsic to the constitution, and independent of the controul of this House; who without commission and without provocation had thought fit to intermeddle in the affairs of the Government and of the Bank, and to attempt the subversion of a system not only eminently beneficial, but confessedly without fault, without mischief; and without danger; a system with which all the world was perfectly satisfied in all its parts, until this officious Committee thought tit to disturb the general satisfaction. But what is the true history of this proceeding? A Committee was appointed last year by the House of Commons, to inquire into the causes of the high price of gold bullion, and into the state of the foreign exchanges arid of the currency 1078 of the country. They took these subject into their consideration: they brought to that consideration talents, and information, such as have rarely been collected together in any one Committee of this House; and they bestowed upon it (that praise no man denies to the Committee) unremitted, diligence and labour. The result of their investigations they submitted to the House, according to its injunction, and to their duty, And because that result was to some persons unexpected and is to others unpalatable, are we therefore justified in turning round upon the Committee of our own appointment, and rebuking them for the execution of the task which we had imposed upon them? What would we have had them do? refuse the task allotted to them by the House? or decline to render an account of the inquiries which we had ordered them to institute? Or would we have had them fashion their Report, in spite of their own conviction, to the creed or the convenience of any persons or party, and recommend only whatever might best flatter our prejudices, and justify our inaction? If such were our Wish, why was the Committee named? Why was not the proposal for its appointment rejected, orat least opposed? I was in the House on the day when it was proposed; and, so far as I recollect, not. a single voice was raised against it. If the subject did not require investigation, it was idle, and not only idle, but mischievous, to set the investigation on foot. If it was apprehended that the possible or probable result might be prejudicial to the interests of the country, then was the time to stop. It would, then have been perfectly easy to do so. A single word, the intimation of a doubt from any quarter of the House might, at that moment, have checked the proceeding. But to institute an inquiry upon a matter of great difficulty, with a predetermination to come to but one conclusion, is neither very creditable to those who appoint, nor very just to those who are appointed, the conductors of it. Although I do not go with the Committee (as I shall presently have occasion to explain) to the length of their practical conclusion; and although the details of this intricate and perplexing subject are, as little agreeable to my taste, or, habits, as to those of any person in the House; although I would as gladly as any, body; have turned aside, from the task of examining the reasonings and deductions of  1079 the Report; yet I cannot in justice throw upon the members of the Committee the blame of those inconveniences which are inherent in the nature of the subject referred to their inquiry. However much I may dislike the unpleasant truths which are told in the Report, I do not think myself warranted to transfer that dislike to those whose duty it has been to tell them. The Committee, then, I say, have only ""lone their duty. Nor can we avoid the performance of the duty which now devolves upon ourselves. Distasteful as the matter may be, it is before us, and we must dispose of it. I do not share in the apprehensions of those persons who predict danger and mischief from this discussion. I have seldom known an instance in which mote good than evil has not arisen out of the parliamentary discussion of subjects, however delicate, upon which the public mind had been previously agitated and divided. As little do I agree with those who think that the discussion must necessarily be barren and useless. Even if it should not terminate (as probably it may not) in the adoption of the practical remedy suggested by the Committee, or in the suggestion of any other in its room, I do not think that the time and the trouble of the House will therefore have been entirely thrown away. The discussion which has already taken place out of doors, renders some decision of this House necessary. In the course of that discussion, the fundamental principles of our whole money system have been disputed and denied; all that had long been considered as fixed and determinate in them, has been shaken, or at least attempted to be shaken: a mischief more serious than even that which the Committee has proposed to cure; and one to which a cure may be (and ought to be) administered by the Resolutions of this House, whatever may become of the practical recommendation of the Committee. Nor is it only out of doors, that these fundamental principles have been questioned. The right hon. gent. opposite to me (Mr. Vanaittart,) a gentleman for whom personally I entertain the sincerest respect as well as regard; and whose just reputation for knowledge upon these subjects, entitles his opinions upon them to very peculiar attention, has countenanced by himself adopting it, a mode of reasoning, which has been much employed in 1080 the written controversy, but which I had hoped no man in this House, and least of all any man of such extensive information, and such high authority, would have been found to endure, much less to sanction. He has rejected altogether the established doctrine of a fixed standard of the currency of the realm; and, instead of trying the disputed value of our present circulating medium by reference so that which has always hitherto been taken as the settled measure in all such inquiries, he has thought himself at liberty to bend and accommodate the fundamental principles of our money system to the state of our currency, such as he happens to find it. Others who have supported the right hon. gentleman's Propositions have carried this licence still farther. They have not only considered the principles of all our coinage laws, so far as they relate to the value of our money, as inapplicable to the present state of our currency, but as altogether obsolete. They appear to look upon the law by which Bank paper is made inconvertible into cash, not as an occasional law, growing out of a temporary necessity, and determinable with that necessity, but as a wise and provident contrivance to substitute, absolutely and indefinitely, for the ancient coin of the kingdom, a currency better adapted, in their opinion, to the present state of the world, and to the peculiar exigencies of this country. The suspension of the cash payments of the Bank had hitherto always been treated as a necessary evil; as an expedient, upon which we were forced with reluctance, and of which we had the decency at least to pretend to desire and to anticipate the discontinuance: but, in the view of the subject which has been taken by these supporters of the right hon. gentleman's Propositions, the Bank Restriction is now become the staple resource in our pecuniary system; it is to be avowed as the standing policy of the state, and to be prized as an invention long desired, and now happily found, for supplying boundless exertion with inexhaustible and un-exhausting finance. The decision of the House, therefore, important as it would undoubtedly be, if it should either confirm the recommendation of the Bullion Committee, or substitute in its stead some other practical measure for the termination of the Bank Restriction, will yet be not less (I had almost said will be more) important, if, even re-  1081 jecting that recommendation, and Confirming the continuance of the restriction, it shall nevertheless at the same time recognize the general principles which that Committee have laid down; and shall separate and distinguish the measure of the restriction itself, from the false and dangerous arguments by which it has been not only justified as an expedient, but recommended as a system. To record principles which are true, and which have been called in question, is not of itself an idle nor an un parliamentary practice: and it is no paradox to say, that to record principles is never so much a matter of duty as when some over-ruling necessity obliges us to a practical departure from them. It then becomes incumbent upon us to prove that we are acting indeed from necessity, not from indifference, or change of system; to take care that our deviation shall not be made a precedent to be resorted to hereafter on occasions of less urgency; to provide that the exception shall not be erected into the rule. This then is the answer which I give to those who represent the concluding Resolution of the honourable and learned chairman (Mr. Horner,) of the Bullion Committee, as the only essential object of our deliberations; and who would persuade us, that, if we are not prepared to decide with him upon the opening of the Bank, we have nothing to do with all his preliminary Resolutions but to get rid of them as quickly as possible. I, for one, am not prepared to vote with him for the opening of the Bank; I shall vote against the honourable gentleman's concluding Resolution: but I think that, according to all sound and practical views, the question, important as it is, whether the Bank shall be opened or shut, sinks into insignificance in comparison with that which has been raised with respect to the principles upon which the whole money system, and consequently the whole credit of the country, essentially depends. Give me the affirmation by parliament of the first ten Resolutions of the honourable and learned gentleman those Resolutions which state (and state correctly) the principles of that money system from which we have been compelled to depart, and the effects of our departure from them; and I would not unwillingly consent to a compromise with the right hon. gentleman opposite to me (Mr. Vansittart.) I would on that condition adopt the two 1082 last of his propositions; adopt them in substance at least, so far as to agree with him that this is not the moment at which our cash payments can be resumed, or at which the precise period of their resumption can be determined. The right hon. gentleman ought surely to be satisfied with this compromise. His conclusion would, to my mind, even flow more logically from the premises laid down in the Resolutions of the hon. and learned gentleman. I certainly cannot subscribe to it as flowing from his own. I am ready to do as he would have me do, if he will allow me to record the reasons of my concurrence: but it is a concurrence which, I feel, requires explanation and apology; it is a concurrence which, if I do not altogether withhold it, I certainly cannot give, except on the condition, that I shall be at liberty to prove at the same time, that it is given not in consequence of the right hon. gentleman's reasons, but in spite of them. That our currency is in such a state that the Bank cannot safely open, I agree: but it is hard to insist that I should find every thing right in that slate of things which forces me to come to such an agreement. My right hon. friend, who spoke last, has with great dexterity as well as eloquence endeavoured to divert our attention from the specific object of this night's deliberation, by directing it to those circumstances in the present situation of affairs, at home and abroad, upon which there is scarcely any difference of feeling or opinion. The inordinate ambition and gigantic power of the enemy the warfare directed by him against our trade and our manufactures; these are topics upon which my right hon. friend has expatiated with a force of statement, and a warmth of language, which do full justice to his argument; and has appealed to us whether we will wantonly aggravate difficulties already so complicated and so overwhelming? He has availed himself with equal skill of another argument, which he well knows would operate upon my mind with no less force than upon his own, and which, if I could indeed be convinced that it was legitimately applied to the question in the way in which he applies it, would lead me, I will not say to concur in his conclusions, but at least to hesitate in rejecting them. He refers to the recent triumphs of our arms; he places before our eyes the prospect of successes still more splendid; he describes the safety of  1083 this country as involved in the war in the Peninsula; and he asks us how that war is to be maintained? how we are to find the means of keeping on foot that army which has already performed such brilliant achievements, and of seconding the exertions of a commander who has carried the British name to the highest point of military glory? Shall such a contest a contest for all that is interesting to this country and to Europe be abandoned? shall lord Wellington be checked in his career? shall Portugal have been liberated only to be again given up to slavery? shall the hopes of Spain have been revived only to be finally dashed and extinguished? God forbid! My right hon. friend well knows that in calling upon me duly to weigh these considerations, he interposes the surest impediment to any rash decision on my part, by which interests so dear to this country could by possibility be brought into hazard. He knows that I must put a violence upon myself before I can coolly calculate the real bearing of topics which come home so forcibly to my feelings; before I can dissipate the illusion which they throw round the matter in debate, and examine dispassionately the degree in which they really apply to it. But I will not pay my right hon. friend so ill a compliment as to suppose that he is not himself perfectly aware, that in thus shaping his argument he has in fact either assumed or omitted the question that is in dispute. The question is not whether we shall continue the war in the Peninsula with all our heart, and with all our might? Who doubts, who dissuades that determination? That point might have been assumed, without hazard of contradiction. But my right hon. friend argues that point, as if it were disputed: and assumes without argument that which it was necessary for him to prove: namely, that to the continuance of the war, and of our successes in the peninsula, it is essential that the present system of our currency should remain unchanged. Just as fairly might I assume without argument that a change in our currency is necessary to this same purpose of continuing; the war; and then retort upon my right, hon. friend his own expostulations against fettering the energies, and cramping the exertions of the country. In either case the point which alone is in dispute, remains to be decided. Why is the continuance of the present 1084 system of currency essential to the continuance of the war? Is it because that currency is in a sound state? or that, being depreciated, a depreciated currency is the best instrument of foreign exertion? Which of these two propositions is it that my right hon. friend intends to maintain? I ask this question with the more earnestness, because throughout the whole of his speech, long, able, and eloquent as it was, I watched in vain for any sentence which distinctly expressed an opinion upon either of them. I did not hear him affirm that the currency was sound; I did not hear him admit that it was depreciated; he always stopped short of this affirmation and of this, admission; and if any distinct proposition could be collected and embodied out of those topics with which he endeavoured to cover these simple questions, it seemed at most to amount to nothing more than this that it was best to goon as we are, avoiding all inquiry on the subject. To that proposition (if that be the proposition which my right hon. friend means to maintain) I answer, that it comes too late. The period for acting upon that policy passed by when the House consented to the appointment of the Bullion Committee. To the question, how shall our military exertions be best supported? I reply By supporting the credit of the country; by ascertaining the soundness of our currency, if it be sound; by ascertaining the degree of its defect, if it be defective; with a view in the one case to apply a remedy so far as a remedy may be applicable; and it"" the other to fix and settle the public opinion, which of itself is no small ingredient in the financial resources of a state. I have no right, and certainly full as little desire, to impute to my right hon. friend that he is avowedly the advocate of a depreciated currency: but this debate would end most unsatisfactorily for the public as well as for the House, if it were to end without its being clearly understood on what precise grounds my right hon. friend thinks the present state of our currency such as it ought to be. First whether he thinks it is not depreciated; secondly, whether, admitting it to be depredated, he considers the depreciation as incurable, and therefore only would take no step to cure it; or thirdly, whether he concurs with those who see in that depreciation a fertile source of wealth and blessings to the country; these,  1085 after all, are the points in dispute: and these points my right hon. friend appears to me to have studiously avoided. Even in that part of his speech in which he approached the nearest to the question of depreciation, my right hon. friend so managed the course of his argument as to make it impossible that he should arrive at any definite conclusion. With a semblance of candour which seemed as if he had adopted an inverted mode of reasoning as the best calculated in this particular instance for discovering the truth, he begins with examining the question of excess. "" Prove,"" says my right hon. friend, ""that there exists an excess, and then I will be ready to go with you into an inquiry whether that excess has produced depreciation?"" Now it can not be necessary to remind my right hon. friend, that to reason from effect to cause has always been the course of sound philosophy. The Committee affirms the existence of depreciation; and, as that depreciation cannot arise from any doubt of the solidity of the Bank of its ability to meet its engagements, they attribute it (unanswerably, as appears to me) to excessive issue. ""Prove this excessive issue,"" says my right hon. friend. But how is positive excess (if I may use that expression) susceptible of proof? How is it possible to prove, that too many bank-notes are issued, so long as there is a single applicant willing to receive them? The comparison of the amount of bank-notes in circulation with that of the aggregate, pecuniary transactions of the community would of itself afford no certain criterion of the sufficiency or excess of that circulation even if it were possible to state that comparison with any thing like accuracy. But who shall pretend to state the actual aggregate amount of all the pecuniary transactions of the community? So far as a pretty general increase of prices is any symptom of excessive currency, that symptom undeniably exists. But I acknowledge it to be no more than a symptom. I admit further that the mere amount of bank paper in circulation, however large it may be, docs not of itself necessarily constitute excess. I admit that there is not excess, unless there be depreciation. Whether depreciation does exist or not, is, therefore, the question which must necessarily have the precedency in our examination. The right hon. gent. opposite to me (Mr. Vansittart), when he opened his 1086 counter-propositions to the House, put, to my hon. friend near me, (Mr. Huskisson,) the question ""What do you mean by depreciation?"" He put this question, rather irregularly, in the middle of his own speech; and seemed to think it matter of triumph that he did not receive, at that moment, an answer in a single word. An answer he has, however, since received, and I should imagine (in one sense at least) to his complete satisfaction. ""By depreciation, do you mean discredit?"" said the right hon. gent. If by discredit, the right hon. gent. means a doubt of the solidity of the Bank, a doubt whether the outstanding demands upon the Bank do not exceed the amount of their assets, unquestionably no such doubt exists, and consequently ""discredit"" enters for nothing into the ""depreciation"" of Bank of England paper. But when the right hon. gent. has obtained this concession, it appears to me that he has obtained nothing at all towards overthrowing the arguments his antagonists, or towards establishing his own. For the same concession would be equally, true with respect to a paper currency which should represent to its full amount the whole moveable and immoveable property: of the country. There would be assets in existence adequate to the redemption of that paper. Of a paper issued to such an amount, although resting on such unquestionable security, it is probable that ray. right hon. friend, who spoke last, would not dispute the excess; yet how could that excess be indicated except by depreciation? That depreciation, in the case which I have supposed; the right hon. gent. (Mr. Vansittart) could not deny; but he must acknowledge that it would arise from other causes than discredit. The argument, therefore, or rather the suggestion (for it has not been distinctly argued), that there can be no depreciation unless arising from or accompanied with, discredit: and the inference which it covertly insinuated, that they who affirm bank notes to be depreciated, intend to attack the credit of the Bank, entirely fall to the ground. The alledged depreciation of Banknotes consists in this that, whereas they did in fact represent heretofore the real as well as the nominal value of the coin which constitutes our lawful money, they, now represent its nominal value only. This is the answer to the question of the right hon. gent.  1087 In return, my hon. friend proposed a question to the right hon. gent., to which I think he has not yet given any answer. ""If you affirm,"" said my hon. friend, ""what I deny, the equivalency of Banknotes to money, tell me, What is the common standard by which you measure that equivalency?"" This question the right hon. gent. has altogether evaded. He as given no answer to it. Docs he mean to acquiesce in those which have been given for him by others who have taken the came side with him in this debate, or by some fanciful writers, who, under the guise and garb of practical men, have indulged themselves in the wildest theories and imaginations, upon this subject of the standard? ""The coin,"" (says a noble lord, who ""poke last night) ""is (or was) the standard of the paper."" But this description does not advance us a single step; for the question still remains, ""What is the standard of the coin? What is that common measure to which coin and paper may be equally referred for the purpose of ascertaining their agreement, or disagreement, with it, and with each other?"" The noble lord (Castlereagh) has indeed devised a singular definition of this measure, in which I should be exceedingly curious to know whether the right hon. gent. concurs. He defines it to be ""a sense of value in reference to currency as compared with commodities."" I hope I do not misquote him. To the best of my recollection, these were the very words "" A sense of value!"" But whose sense? with whom is it to originate? and how is it to be communicated to others: who is to promulgate, who is to acknowledge, or who is to enforce it? How is ft to be defined? and how is it to be regulated? What ingenuity shall calculate, or what authority controul its fluctuation? Is the"" sense"" of to-day the same as that of yesterday, and will it be unchanged tomorrow? It does fill me with astonishment that any man, of an accurate and reasoning mind, should not perceive that this wild and dangerous principle (if principle it can be called) would throw loose all the transactions of private life all contracts and pecuniary bargains by leaving them to be measured from day to day, and from hour to hour, by no other rule than that of the' fancies and interests of ""ach individual conflicting with the fancies and interests of his neighbour. A ""sense of value!"" It is not many days since an experiment was tried upon 1088 this ""sense,"" which may serve to illustrate the probable course of its operations, it left exclusively to its own guidance. The artisan who on the Thursday night had exchanged a one-pound note with his neighbour for four dollars, found in the morning that he had, insensibly to himself, become two shillings richer by the exchange. I am not, here, about to inquire whether the Bank were right or wrong in raising the denomination of the dollar; I refer to this operation merely as an illustration of the argument: and I ask, Where would be the end of such operations if every individual's ""sense of value"" were to be his only guide in his dealings with his neighbours? In this instance the authority of the Bank sanctioned and limited the degree of the rise in the current value of the dollar or, to put the same thing in other words, the degree of the loss which the Bank-note should sustain in exchange against the dollar. But is it to be imagined that, if they had merely sanctioned the principle of such alteration, without limiting the degree, two shillings in the pound, or ten per cent. is the precise amount of the rise on the one hand, or of the depreciation on the other, which all the holders of Bank notes, and of dollars respectively, would have agreed to fix by common ""sense of value?"" Is not such a supposition utterly absurd? Is it not clear that something wholly extrinsic to that capricious ""sense,"" is necessary to regulate the ordinary dealings between man and man; and that the course of those dealings could not be left without a guide, but at the hazard, or the certainty rather, of immediate and inextricable confusion? If, however, we were persuaded to leave the proportions and prices of all commodities to be adjusted by this ""sense of value,"" we ought at least to be consistent in our theory and practice. This ""sense of value,"" which is now proposed to be erected, into an universal measure, has been occasionally adopted as such by individuals. There is a man now expecting the judgment of the law, whose ""sense of value"" led him to exchange for guineas a proportion of Bank of England paper, which he considered as no more than an equivalent. Of what crime was this man guilty, but of obeying that natural and instinctive impulse, which the noble Lord is now prepared to set up as a substitute for the standard of our money? If there be nothing more fixed and stable than indivi-  1089 dual feeling, to which the estimate of values can be referred, let us at least refrain from punishing the exercise of that individual feeling. If the law shall decline to fix a standard measure, it cannot reserve the right of visiting erroneous measurement as a crime. This would be an injustice like that of the Eastern Monarch who called upon the Soothsayers to interpret his dream, but refused to tell them the dream of which he required the interpretation. No dream, it must be owned, could be more extravagant than the visions of those practical men who have undertaken to refine away the standard of the currency of the realm into a pure abstraction. There is indeed something perfectly ludicrous in the inconsistency and injustice with which they impute a love of abstraction to their opponents, while they are themselves indulging in the most wanton departures from substance and reality. ""Beware of abstract theories,"" say they to the Bullion Committee, when they find fact and law-laid down as the foundation of its Report. "" Beware of abstract theories,"" say they to the honourable and learned chairman of the Committee, when they find in his first seven Resolutions nothing like theory or imagination; but a clear, concise, a dry and faithful, recapitulation of those rules which the statutes of the country have established for the weight-and fineness of its coin. Nor has the speech with which that hon. and learned gent, introduced and enforced his Resolutions a speech which, remarkable as it was for eloquence and ability of every kind, was by nothing so distinguished as by its perpetual appeal to acknowledged principles arid established law, even-that speech has not rescued the hon. and learned gent. from the imputations of flight bless and romance; The same caution to beware of abstract theories is addressed to my hon. friend near me, whose intelligence whose accuracy, and whose official knowledge, digested and assimilated by a powerful and realty practical understanding, make him perhaps Of all men the least proper object of such an admonition. And this admonition comes from whom? from the inventors and champions of"" abstract currency;"" from those who, after exhausting in vain every attempt to find an earthly-substitute for the legal and ancient standard of our money, have divested the pound sterling of all the properties of matter, and pursued it under the name of the 1090 ""ideal unit,"" into the regions of non-entity and nonsense! When the ingenious sophistry of Dr. Berkeley, to prove the non-existence of matter, was quoted to Dr. Johnson, as a fallacy not easy to be refuted, Dr. Johnson stamped his foot with force against a stone, and exclaimed, ' I refute it thus.' Unluckily I know no process of reasoning that can reduce one of these practical men to the necessity of admitting, that a pound sterling is not a creature of the imagination: one cannot appeal even to their senses, because that sense of theirs, which I suppose is the most conversant with this subject, the ""sense of value,"" is enlisted on the other side. But one may appeal from their theories to ancient records, to positive institution, and to existing law. On those authorities, I contend that a certain specified weight of gold or silver, of a certain fineness, is the only definition of a pound sterling, which an Englishman desirous of conforming to the laws of his country, is bound to regard, or to understand. Here then it is that I should pause for the answer of the right hon. gent opposite to me to the question of my hon. friend. Does he admit or deny this definition of standard? does he admit or deny the existence of a standard at this moment conformable to this definition? If he admits it, then it is possible not only to answer his question with respect to the meaning of the word ""depreciation,"" but also to demonstrate that a depreciation, in the sense in which that word is used, does exist. Grant but the lawful standard as the instrument of mensuration; and nothing is more easy than to assign the exact proportion in which coin and notes differ in value from each other. But while the right hon. gent. denies the existence of any such instrument, how reasonably require that the accuracy of such a measurement should be proved to his satisfaction? A pound sterling is either 20/62 of a pound of standard silver; or, 20/21 of a guinea weighing not less than 5dwts and 8grs. This is the simple and the only definition which the practice of our ancestors recognizes, and the law of the country allows; Does a one-pound note represent this portion of the precious metals, or doseit not If it does, the legal coin of the country and the notes of the Bank; are equivalent? If not, either the law misstated or the depreciation is proved ""Oh! but,"" says the right hon. gentle-  1091 man ""the Bank note represents the coin itself; quacnus coin; and has no reference or relation to the quantity of gold or silver which that coin contains."" But does not the right hon. gentleman see that it is impossible for him to avail himself of l the law in one instance and to deny its operation in the other? The King's Proclamation confirmed by Act of Parliament has fixed the denomination of the coin; which denomination it is admitted on all hands, the Bank note continues to represent: but the same Act of Parliament has fixed the weight of the coin as the sole and indispensible test of the value which that denomination implies. The law (as the tight hon. gentleman well knows) watches with such scrupulous anxiety over the weight of the guinea, as to consider the loss of a single grain as sufficient to destroy its character as a legal coin. When the law evinces this anxiety about weight, is it not a little too much to assume in argument that its only care is denomination? But what is the proposition for the sake of which this assumption is hazarded? Not simply that Banknotes are a convenient symbol of coin, but that they are actually equivalent to it. In proof of this equivalency it is contended that the law has bound them together. First, this argument would prove too much: it would undoubtedly get rid of all the embarrassing considerations of standard, of weight, and of intrinsic value; but, on the other band, those who maintain it would be involved in absurdities, which even the ingenuity of the righthon. gent. could not reconcile. They would have to maintain, for instance, that in the year 1095, when, previous to the resolution taken to reform the silver coinage, arguments something like those which are now used on the right hon gentleman's side of the question, prevailed upon the legislature to try the experiment of a statute by which it was made penal to receive or tender the unclipped coin at any higher price than the clipped coin, they would have to maintain, I say, that from the passing of that act, the clipped and unclipped coin of the country became precisely equivalent; in other words, that an ounce of silver in the one became, by the operation of the statute, equal to an ounce and quarter of the same silver, in the other unquestioriably this cannot be what the right hon. gentleman is prepared to maintain as true though I must admit on the 1092 other hand, that a subject of this country-might at that time have been punished for acting as if he thought it false. But is the relation which was thus produced by law between two things obviously of different values, equivalency? Or is it to be imagined, that so forced and unnatural a stale of things, call it by what name you will, could be maintained by any law, that any law could continue long in force whose purpose it was to maintain it? The consequence of this state of things in 1695, was the disappearance, that is to say, the hoarding, the melting, or the exportation of the perfect coin: the further consequence was, that, after a short trial of the compulsory law, Parliament found itself obliged to go to the root of the evil, and to reform the depreciated part of the currency. But moreover the right hon. gentleman's assertion of the equivalency of coin and Bank notes, is in direct contradiction with admissions of his own. In the course of this debate he has admitted, (though others have denied) that in the year 1804 the paper of the Bank of Ireland was depreciated. I might here ask him in what sense he understands the word depreciated when he so applies it: and he would have to answer me as it has been answered to him, that the Irish Bank note did not then represent the intrinsic value of the coin with which it was interchangeable. This s a most important admission on the part of the right hon. gentleman; and it has a bearing upon the present question, of which one would almost apprehend he could not have been aware, but which nevertheless he will find it difficult to deny. The premium, as I understand, in 1804 was about 1s. 6d. on the guinea. At that period Irish Bank paper, as interchangeable with English, was at a discount which pretty nearly corresponded with its depreciation in reference to the coin. The premium now openly paid in Ireland upon guineas is from 3s. 6d. to 4s. But Irish Bank paper is now exchangeable with English nearly at par. Whence is it that English Bank paper, which had an advantage over Irish Bank paper in 1804, when Irish paper was depreciated only about seven and a half per cent, should be now nearly on a par with it, when it is confessedly depreciated almost twenty per cent.? If indeed English Bank paper has suffered a depreciation to the same amount, this phaenomenon is perfectly intelligible: but upon the hypothesis of the perfect  1093 and unchanged equivalency of English Bank paper and coin, it admits of no solution. To my mind, I do confess, here is one decisive proof of depreciation. But, is not the case of the dollar, (to which I have had occasion to refer with another view in a former part of the argument), itself a conclusive proof, not Only of the existence of a depreciation of Bank paper but of the opinion of the Bank, and of the government, that such depreciation does exist? Why was the Bank note, which was equivalent to four dollars on one day; worth two shillings less than four dollars the next? Those who claim to themselves exclusively the title of practical men, take a subtle distinction, and say, that it is not the Bank note which is worth less, but the dollar which is worth more: and they treat as theorists and visionaries all whose faculties do not enable them to enter into this distinction. But however the variation arose, why did the government and the Bank think it necessary to sanction and promulgate it? Why? but because the dollar, being a coin circulating in this country by sufferance only, a currency of convention, would, according to the admission, or rather the declaration of the Bank, under the authority of the privy council, have been driven out of circulation, that is to say, would have been hoarded or melted or exported, if it had not been allowed to pass at the marketable value of the silver which it contains. With this example before their eyes, with this admission and declaration still recent before the eyes of the public, there are yet some persons who contend, that the disappearance of our legal coin the guinea is no proof of the depreciation of Bank notes, in respect to that coin; but is entirely owing to the balance of trade and of payments, and to the wiles of our inveterate enemy. The Bank note, which, confronted with the dollar, shrunk from twenty to eighteen shillings, preserves, as they affirm, in face of the guinea, an unaltered, and unalterable equivalency. And what is it, according to their theory, that occasions this peculiarity? The law. The law, which does what? The law, which makes it criminal (if indeed it be criminal) to exchange the guinea for more than its denominative value in Banknotes; and which prohibits the exportation of the legal coin of the realm. Let us see what is the mode in which these powerful and beneficial laws are 1094 now actually operating. The result which they were intended to obtain confessedly was to keep our legal coin at home and to maintain it in circulation. The result actually is, that such coin has vanished from domestic circulation, and that it is exported to all parts of the world. The dollars were sent into circulation, unprotected by any law which should prevent their exportation to foreign countries: for a time they circulated in abundance; at length they began to disappear. By what process has it been attempted, and successfully, to check their disappearance? By the same process which is so wisely contrived to prevent the disappearance of guineas? By forbidding more to be given for them, than they had hitherto been exchanged for in Bank-notes? No but by a precisely contrary process by allowing the dollars to pass at, or above their value. The consequence is, a continued circulation of dollars in this country, in spite of the balance of trade and of the wiles of the enemy. Here then are two metallic currencies, one of which continues in circulation, while the other vanishes from it. The distinctive differences between them are, First, that of one the exportation is permitted, and of the other prohibited. I acknowledge the perversity of human nature, and its proneness to do what is forbidden; but I cannot think that principle alone sufficient to account for the exportation of the coin, which it is illegal to export, and for the continuance in circulation of that which might be exported without offence. Secondly, the one is exchangeable for its full marketable value in our domestic currency, whereas the law enforces (or is supposed to enforce) the exchange of the other at no more than its denominative rate. The bank-note is the common measure both of the guinea and of the dollar, of the exportable and unexportable coin: the guinea it is allowed by law to measure only according to its denomination; the dollar, by the ordinance of the Bank, it is allowed to measure according to its marketable value. What is the result? The coin, which is by law unexportable, flies to another market, while the exportable remains at home. But let it, for argument's sake, be conceded that the rise of the dollar is not a proof of depreciation in the bank-note. It follows then that if the bank-note,  1095 which would heretofore have purchased four dollars, is not depreciated in respect to the dollar because it is now obliged to call in two shillings to its aid in order to make the same purchase, neither would the bank-note, which heretofore purchased a guinea with the aid of one shilling only, be depreciated in respect to the guinea, if it should now be allowed to make the same purchase with the aid of four or five shillings. I think I may defy the most practical of men to quarrel with this proposition. Well then if this be so and if it be indeed an object to keep our guineas at home, why is not the operation, which has been so successful with respect to the dollar, applied to the guinea? What difference is there in the principle? and what difference in the practical policy of the transaction, but such as would preponderate in favour of the guinea? If it be answered, ""that the guinea is a legal coin, which the dollar is not; that the dollar might be treated as arbitrarily and unceremoniously as we pleased, but that the same experiment could not be tried upon the guinea without an alteration of the law, and that alterations of the law are dangerous."" I reply, that the law is much less in our way on this point than gentlemen seem to apprehend. It is true that the dollar is a foreign coin of which our laws take no specific cognizance; but it is equally true that there is another coin in the country, not a legal coin, a coin, of which the law takes no notice except to put it out of its protection; which no man is obliged, or even permitted, to receive from another in payment; which in short is as completely devoid of the qualities of British coin as the dollar, and indeed more completely so, since it is expressly stripped of those qualities by statute. Now, if such a coin as this can be found, where is the harm of trying upon it the same experiment which has been so happily applied to the dollar; especially if it be, as fortunately it is, a gold coin, and there fore capable of supplying that share which dollars do not supply, towards the completement or a metallic circulation?, The coin to which I allude, is one which my hon. friend near me (Mr. Huskisson) is accused of having treated in his pamphlet with exaggerated respect, but which in the course of this debate has, I think too much disparaged; I mean the light guinea. The light guinea is not, any more than 1096 the dollar, a legal coin. A guinea having arrived by wear at a certain degree of lightness, is at once divested by law of all its qualities of coin, and is reduced to its intrinsic value, whatever that may be, as bullion. It happens, to be sure, at the present moment, that this reduction, as measured in bank notes, is a promotion. But that is equally true in respect to the dollar. The rate at which the dollar now passes is not only higher than it was some time ago; but higher than that which it bears, from its intrinsic value, in comparison with the legal coin of the country. Whether it was right to raise the denomination of the dollar, I do not think it necessary to give an opinion: that is done. But upon the principle, whatever it was, on which the denomination of the dollar was raised, there can surely be no objection to suffering the light guinea to go for what it is worth, and thereby obtaining an anomalous gold currency, to correspond with the anomalous silver currency, each alike independent of the legal coin of the realm. The legal coin the guinea of full lawful weight, would still remain, in the eye of the law, in that of the imagination, and in the argument of the right hon. gent., as the equivalent for bank-notes. It would not often come forth indeed to afford a practical illustration of his argument; but he might continue to enjoy the satisfaction of maintaining, as he does now, as an abstract proposition, that bank-notes and guineas are equivalent in law. Meantime the advantage derived from the marketablencss of light guineas would be, either to retain at least that portion of our metallic circulation at home, or to make the foreigner or the enemy pay its full value for it on exportation. It is on all hands acknowledged by the right hon. gent. and his supporters it is earnestly contended that our gold finds its way out of the country, either in discharge of the balance of payments, or in to the coffers of the enemy. That enemy is by some persons represented as sitting' like a great spider in the midst of its web, and drawing along the living lines and fibres of his net all the gold of Great Britain into an abys from which it is never to return. By what process this can be effected, except by that of a trade of some sort or other, we are not told, and I am at a loss to conceive. Among all the dangers of the country, many of them, real and formidable, a danger, hap-  1097 pily more visionary than this was never apprehended by a disordered imagination. That our gold however goes from us, is generally asserted and believed; and whether by a natural efflux, or by some unheard-of power of magnetic attraction in Buonaparte, is, in regard to the question which we are considering, of little moment. It goes; and we wish to stop it. It can be stopped effectually only by being retained in circulation at home. It can be retained in circulation, (as those who raised the denomination of the dollar, and who gave the reasons which were given for raising it, must of all men be the last to deny), only by allowing it to pass for what it is intrinsically worth, or what it will fetch in the market. Here, however, I shall be met by an argument which has been urged with much vehemence and solemnity by the right hon. gentleman, (Mr. Vansittart) that the law absolutely prohibits the exportation of our coin, and that any reasoning therefore, which is founded upon the supposition of that exportation, is not only incorrect, but is of a most immoral and dangerous tendency, as holding out encouragement to perjury and fraud. Let us examine this argument. We are all agreed upon the fact, that gold bullion is at a high price in the currency of this country. We are all agreed, that either as the consequence of this high price or as the cause of it, or both, there is a great scarcity of gold bullion in this country. We are all agreed, that the gold coin has nearly vanished from circulation: and nobody doubts, so far as I have heard, and nobody has asserted more strenuously than the right hon. gent. and those who side with him, that this high price and scarcity of bullion, and this vanishing of our gold coin, are infallible indications of a large exportation of gold; of which exportation a large part must, as infallibly, have consisted of coin, either melted or unmelted. Upon these facts, I say, we are all agreed. Now I ask, is it not idle, is it not absurd, to assume, for the purpose of argument, a supposed obedience to the law, which notoriously has no existence; and to deny for the purpose of argument, a fact which is acknowledged by all to be the surest symptom, and contended by many to be the origin and cause, of the evils which have brought us to the necessity of the present discussion? Is it not wholly unworthy an assembly of legislators, to pre- 1098 tend an ignorance in our legislative capacity of that, which every one of as in hit individual capacity perfectly believes to be true? Is the existence of a statute which, as we know, is openly violated, and for the most part with impunity, every day in the week, to be pleaded as a bar against any attempt to remedy the evils which confessedly result from its violation? What then can be more unjust, or more ridiculous, than to represent those persons as countenancing and encouraging perjury and fraud, who only tell you, what you yourselves avow, that perjury and fraud are and have always been committed under your present system of law; and who, inferring that they always will be committed under that system, suggest to you the expediency of amending it? Who are the encouragers of crimes? they who, finding the existing law notoriously inadequate to counteract the temptation to commit them, propose either to change the law or to remove the temptation; or they who content themselves with whimpering over the depravity of human nature, and, instead of endeavouring to prevent the commission of the crime, console themselves with the reflection that the mischief to the public is only in proportion to the guilt of the criminal? He was not an unwise or unjust judge, of whom it is recorded, that ""He sent the thief, who stole the gold, away, ""And punist'd him who put it in his way."" Undoubtedly, it is neither wise nor just to place temptations in men's way, which we know, by constant experience, to be sufficient to overpower the positive enactments of law. It is neither politic nor moral to resort on every occasion to the obligation of oaths as supplementary to a defective legislation. This policy unfortunately pervades too many of our statutes; and it is but rarely successful in its object, never perhaps where considerable gain and great facility conspire to tempt to perjury. The exportation of coin, or of bullion melted from coin, when the exchanges are unfavourable beyond a certain limit, is looked upon as so much in the natural course of things, that most writers who have treated of coinage and of trade, have laid it down as a consequence not to be disputed, and not even necessary to be proved. According to the concurrent opinions of such writers, the efflux of bullion from one country to anothe is governed by causes nearly as steady and uniform in their operation, as those Which  1099 govern the seasons or the tides. As well might you pretend to fix a limit on the shore, and bid the flowing ocean advance no farther, as attempt by the interposition of a statute to stop the tide of the precious metals in whatever direction it is made to flow by the influence of commercial necessity and commercial demand. The right hon. gent. and those who adopt his views of the present question, acknowledge the force of these principles: they attribute, in fact, the whole of our difficulties to their operation. There is indeed a slight difference of opinion among them as to the cause of the export of our gold; some attributing it to the demand for gold in the market of the continent, others to the necessity of remitting it from hence, in payment of the balance of trade; but all concurring that, whatever may be the degree in which either of these causes, separately or jointly, operate, the result is an irresistible attraction of the gold of this country to the continent. Is it not, then, with marvellous inconsistency that these Same gentlemen oppose the mere existence of a powerless law, and a high-coloured description of the crimes which it occasions and constitutes, as an answer, and the only answer, to those who contend, that, if the evil which the law is intended to prevent, be indeed one which it is important to check, and if the efflux of our gold be Certain, so long as the force of the temptation is stronger than the restraint of the law, it is necessary, and it would be as wise as humane, either to alter the law, or to diminish the temptation? I may perhaps be inclined to believe, that the repeal of this law would be in itself no unwise measure. That belief might be supported by the opinion of many able writers and experienced statesmen, and by the example of many of those Stales in which commerce has been most flourishing, and credit and coin most abundant. I admit hat the immediate, the momentary effect of this repeal, (if unaccompanied by any other measure), might be to increase the exportation of our gold, by removing the scruples of such persons as may now perhaps be wavering between temptation on the one hand, and obedience to the law on the other. Even so, however, it wolld have the benefit of saving all that perjury and fraud, which shock, so justly, the moral feelings of the House; and of extending to the honest trader a convemence which is now exclusively reserved for the dishonest one. But in the long 1100 run, I certainly do not believe that the repeal of this law would swell by a single guinea the amount of the export of out gold. It is true that the repeal of this law alone would not have a necessary tendency to bring gold again into circulation in this country, either by recalling what has been exported, or by enticing what is now hoarded, out of its hiding places. That would be the effect of the other alteration to which I have already alluded of suspending the law and the proclamation which limit the current rate of the guinea, and permitting it to pass according to its intrinsic value. I have indeed stated this proposition hitherto only as applicable to the light guinea; of which the purchase, at its intrinsic value, is certainly no infringement either of the letter or the spirit of any existing proclamation or statute. I do not know whether I might, without presumption, say, that the law is by no means clear on this point, even with respect to guineas of full legal weight. Guineas of legal weight, however, I left out of my proposition in the former part of my argument, expressly, as I said, in the hope of conciliating the right hon. gent., by leaving-untouched, in respect to guineas of full weight, his proposition, of the equivalency of Bank paper and legal coin. But if the right hon. gent. should be disposed to concur with me at all, I trust, upon reflexion, he would not be prevented from doing so by the contemplation of this trifling advantage to his argument. If he will con-, sent to let guineas go for what they are worth in the market, he will have a gold currency; he will prevent the exportation of our coin; he will get rid of fraud' and perjury: and all this benefit he will purchase at no greater expence, than that of being one argument out of pocket. It will then, to be sure, be vain for him to contend, against the daily evidence of men's senses, that Bank paper and guineas are, at their present respective denominations, equivalent to each other: but at least we shall have them both, and they may circulate amicably together. That by no other possible means the coin of the country can be retained in circulation, so long as the precious metal of which it is composed is intrinsically of a value so much higher than the rate at which it is estimated in our currency is a proposition of which all experience, as well as all reason, establishes the truth.  1101 The present state of the law in the present state of our currency operates, in fact, as a bounty upon the exportation of our coin. Of the two causes of the export of gold, which are admitted by the right hon. gent. and his friends, the supposed demand for gold on the continent, and the supposed necessity for exporting it to set right the balance of our trade, the first will undoubtedly have an uncontrolled operation, so long as there is no counter-demand for gold in the market at home so long as the Bank do not purchase, and as no one else purchases here, except for exportation: the second would, in a natural slate of things, find its limit far within the amount of the balance to be set right; it would cease to operate, whenever the scarcity of gold, produced here by exportation, and the plenty produced on the continent by its importation, rendered gold less eligible for transmission abroad than any other merchantable commodity. But this limit it can never find, so long as gold is the only merchantable commodity for which the consumption of this country affords no market. Independently, however, of these causes, the difference between the real value of the precious metal and that at which it is rated in our currency, would be itself sufficient to ensure us against the continuance of a guinea, in circulation. Demand on the continent might be counteracted by demand here; and gold would cease to be a preferable article for transmission abroad, from the moment at which it, like other articles, could be sold for its real value at home. But, imprisoned in the coin, and degraded by its imprisonment, gold has an unconquerable tendency to escape from a situation so unnatural: and it would make its escape from such a situation, even although you did not owe the continent any thing; and although there were no more demand on the continent for gold, than for any other article of merchandize. But this, I may be told, is the language of theory. Is not the principle, then, recognised by any Sober practical authority? Let us hear the statute-book itself. ""Whereas it has been a practice,"" says the preamble to the act 14 Geo. 3, chap. 70,"" to export the new and perfect coin of the realm for private advantage, and to the great detriment of the public; and the like practice will continue"" (adds this theoretical and visionary preamble) ""while pieces differing greatly in weight, are current under the same denomination, and at the same rate of value. "" 1102 The persons who framed this act, and. framed it for the express and practical' purpose of restoring the credit of our currency, could not be ignorant of the penalties under which the exportation of coin was prohibited: yet we see, that in spite of these penalties, they take for granted as inevitable the ""continued"" exportation of the coin, so long as the temptation to export it continues. We see further, that, in their opinion conformity to standard weight is the distinctive quality by which the value of money is to be estimated. We see lastly, that without any reference to demand for gold on the continent"" without any reference to an unfavourable, balance of trade, the certain result of ail attempt to circulate together, ""under the same denomination and at the same rate of value,"" two descriptions of currency, differing in intrinsic value from each other, is to drive that which is of the higher intrinsic value out of circulation. This is, in fact, as I understand it, the whole doctrine of the Bullion Committee upon this subject: and so far from having the guilt or the merit of novelty, we find it assumed six-and-thirty years ago, in the preamble of an act of parliament, as a doctrine established and self-evident. Of this doctrine, thus adopted by Parliament in the year 1774, there is an earlier and not less authoritative recognition in the Report of sir Isaac Newton, in the year 1717;. of the existence of which Report I was surprised to hear a right hon. friend of mine (Mr. Rose) declare himself entirely ignorant. A person so distinguished as my right hon. friend unquestionably is by great knowledge and indefatigable research, I should have thought, could hardly have missed a document of such interest and importance, and so immediately bearing upon the subject before us. This Report was made by sir Isaac Newton, in his capacity of Master, of the Mint, and is to be found in; cur Journals, vol. xviii. p. 664 It is too long for me to trouble the House with reading it: but gentlemen will find, upon looking into it, that upon a reference made to him by the lords of the Treasury, as to, the best method of preventing the melting down of the silver; coin, sir Isaac Newton represents the;, temptation to melt and export it, as ""arising from the higher price of silver, in other places than in England, in proportion to gold;"" that is to say, from the circumstance, that the silver coin than  1103 our standard currency, was, by the regulations of our Mint, exchangeable with the gold coin at a rate somewhat lower than that at which it was exchangeable, as bullion, with gold in the general market of Europe. So small was this difference, that the taking of sixpence from the current rate of the guinea was estimated by sir Isaac Newton as sufficient to cure the evil; and yet, small as this difference was, during its continuance, and by its operation alone, the silver coin of standard weight was daily vanishing from circulation. In this report of sir Isaac Newton, and in the principles which are laid down in it, is to be found the answer to many of my right hon. friend's (the Chancellor of the Exchequer's) observations upon that part of the Report of the Bullion Committee which refers to the re-coinage of, the silver currency in the year 1696. The subsequent disappearance of the new silver coin, is not, as my right hon. friend seemed to insinuate, a proof that the re-coinage at that time had been unadvisedly undertaken; or that it was not the only cure that could be applied to that depreciation of the currency, which Parliament had attempted in vain to remedy (as I have already had occasion to state) by a penal law. It is true that, by a slight error, in the valuation of the two precious metals with respect to each other, the silver coin was rated a small degree below its just proportion to gold; and that, in consequence, it began to disappear not long after the re-coinage was completed. But this technical error does not in any degree vitiate the principles on which the re-coinage had been adopted. It in no degree diminishes or affects the merit of those who had the courage to undertake, and the firmness to carry through that important work, in spite of the prevalence for a time, even in this House, of prejudices very much akin to those of the present day. Those prejudices were sufficiently strong to defeat for a considerable time the intentions of the government, after they had upon mature deliberation convinced themselves of the absolute necessity of the measure; but the good sense, temper and perseverance of that administration triumphed in the end; and it is no disparagement to my right hon. friend, to recommend the example of the administration of 1696 to his serious consideration. The war in which king William was 1104 then engaged against France, may not have been equal with the present war in magnitude of exertion. Yet if we compare the means of the country at that period with its present means, and consider the exertions which were then made, it would perhaps be difficult to say that any excuse could be offered now, which was not in a great measure applicable then, for sparing, amidst the burthens of war, any internal effort which was not indispensable. But, the restoration of the currency to a sound state was then deemed to be indispensable; and the war was considered not as a reason for postponing the required effort, but as an additional reason for making it with as little delay as possible. The high price of gold was then, as it is now, one striking indication of the deteriorated state of the currency. The indication might, indeed, be at that time more undeniable, because, gold not being then our standard coin, and the guinea not being limited by law as to the rate at which it should pass current, the high price became immediately visible in the gold coin as well as in bullion, the guinea being actually exchangeable for as much as thirty shillings of the clipped silver. The unfavourable state of our exchanges with foreign countries afforded then, as it does now, the other most unerring proof that all was not sound in the currency of this country; a proof of which my right hon. friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer clearly admits the validity, when he admits that the unfavourableness of the exchange might probably now be corrected by correcting the excess, or (if he objects to the word excess) diminishing the abundance of our paper currency. This admission I understood my right hon. friend to make in the most unequivocal terms: not meaning thereby that I understood him to admit that it was advisable to diminish the paper currency for the sake of correcting the unfavourableness of the exchange; but simply that such a correction of the exchange would be the effect of such a diminution of paper. This leads me to consider the subject of the exchanges, as it bears upon that of depreciation. I shall treat it as concisely as I can: both because I must confess, that with all the attention which I have bestowed upon it, I am perfectly conscious that I have not been able to unravel all the intricacies of the subject; and also  1105 because it appears to me, that the whole question as to depreciation is disposed of by the preceding part of the argument, that is to say, by the comparison of currency with bullion. The state of the exchanges may add some illustration to that argument; but is not wanted for the purpose of establishing it. If that which constitutes the par of exchange between any two countries, be (as, if I am not mistaken, it is) an equal quantity of precious metal in their respective currencies; this definition alone sufficiently shows that, whatever other considerations there may be, whether growing out of law or out of opinion, which regulate and sustain the rate of a currency at home, its value can be estimated abroad by no other criterion than that of the quantity of precious metal for which a specific portion of it is exchangeable. The foreigner knows nothing of the value of the currency of any other country except that a certain portion of that currency represents and will procure in his own country a certain quantity of precious metal. The question of the exchanges would therefore be as simple as the question of depreciation, if there were not confessedly other causes which operate upon the exchange, and the operation of which may sometimes be concurrent with that of the relative values of the respective currencies, and sometimes may tend to counteract it. A country which imports from another more than it exports to it of all other articles of commerce, is supposed to make up the difference by a transmission of bullion. In point of fact, this transmission takes place in much fewer instances than the theory supposes: but the necessity of making it either actually or virtually, cause"" a variation in the rate of exchange in favour of the creditor, and to the disadvantage of the debtor country; the amount of which variation is measured by, and expresses, the cost of making the transmission. Supposing the currencies of two countries each in a perfectly sound state, any variation from the par of exchange, between them can be produced only by the one country having a debt to discharge to the other. Supposing the debts and Credits of two countries to be exactly balanced, any variation from the par of exchange between them can only be produced by a depreciation in the currency of 1106 one of them. These causes, however, may both exist at the same time: and they may exist either on opposite sides or together; in the one case aggravating, in the other counteracting each other. A country might be largely in debt to another, and yet, if its currency were sound, and the currency of the creditor country deteriorated, the course of the exchange would exhibit only the difference between the contending effects of such deterioration on the one hand, and such debt on the other: and it might happen that these effects might be so precisely balanced, as exactly to neutralise each other. But when a country is in the situation of being indebted to another, and at the same time of having a depreciated currency, the depression of the exchange exhibits the combined effect of both causes. This last may, or may not be, our present situation. For I am far from taking upon myself to assert that the balance of the payments from us to the continent enters for nothing into the amount of the unfavourable exchange against this country. I only deny that it can be the sole cause of that unfavourableness. Still less do I pretend to define the share which this cause may have in producing the effect. But as it is obvious that the depression of the exchange from this cause can never for any great continuance of time very far exceed the expence of transmitting bullion for the liquidation of the balance of payments: as it is not only acknowledged but contended, that bullion for this purpose is in fact transmitted; as the expence of the transmission is perfectly known, in all its several parts of price, freight, and insurance; and as their collective result, is notoriously very far within the limits of the actual depression of the exchange; there will remain of that depression a large share to be accounted for, after every deduction that can be made on account of the balance of payments; and that remainder can no otherwise be accounted for, than by the deterioration of our currency. The state of the exchanges therefore is a proof, though I do not admit it to be a necessary proof. still less could I allow it to be the test, of a depreciated currency. I do not admit it to be a necessary proof; because, the price of bullion in the currency is proof sufficient without it. I do not allow it to be the test; because under certain circumstances a currency might be depreciated to a limited degree; without  1107 producing a visible depression of the exchange, nay, it might co-exist with an exchange positively favourable. These cases would arise, whenever the effect produced upon the exchange by the balance of payments in favour of the country Whose currency is depreciated in the one case exactly equalled, or in the other exceeded, the degree of the depreciation. But though a depreciation of the currency might thus exist without inducing an unfavourable exchange; a state of the exchange unfavourable to a great degree, and progressively growing worse for a great length of time, is an infallible indication of a depreciated currency. This is all the use that I think it necessary to make of the arguments to be drawn from the exchanges; and so far as this goes, I cannot understand how any one can doubt as to their bearing. We do not doubt with respect to other countries, that a sound or unsound state of their currency influences the state of their exchanges. When we see the exchanges between Hamburgh or Amsterdam, on the one hand, and Russia or Austria on the other, unfavourable in a great degree to either of the two latter countries, we have no hesitation in at once ascribing that unfavour-ableness, in great part at least, to a depreciation of its currency. My right hon. friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer, has taken what I must think not a very fair advantage of an argument of an hon. gent. opposite to me, (Mr. Sharp) when he has represented him as having recommended the general policy of Holland and of Hamburgh as an object of imitation for this country, because the hon. gent. stated, that by not issuing a paper-money, the currencies of Holland and of Hamburgh had been preserved from depreciation. The hon. gent. certainly did not guard and qualify his statement with all the circumstances which were nevertheless obviously connected, in his mind, with the proposition which he was advancing: but it is quite as clear that nothing but the strong temptation of flying from argument to declamation; could have led my right hon. friend so far to mistake the hon. gent.'s meaning. The meaning of the hon. gent. evidently was not to holdout Holland as having been wise in its submissions and compliances towards France, and as enjoying the reward of her prudent obedience in a state, of enviable happiness and prosperity. Still less could he intend (how is it possible that any rational being Could 1108 be for a moment suspected of intending?) to extol the prowess of Hamburgh: "" prowess"" was, I think, the word which my right hon. friend did not disdain to put into the hon. gent.'s mouth, for the sake of making an indignant comment upon it. The scope of the hon. gent.'s argument, I understood to be simply this: that if Holland, impoverished by an exhausting war, and preyed upon by an exacting despotism, if Hamburgh, in the very clutches of the French power, if these unhappy states, stripped of their commerce and independence, could yet maintain their respective currencies undepreciated; it would seem to follow that a state of war, however expensive and burthensome, that stagnation of commerce, that even the oppression of a conquering enemy, were not sufficient justifications, much less necessary causes, of such a system of currency as that which (according to the hon. gent.'s argument) now existed in this country; and of which my right hon. friend and others seemed prepared to justify the continuance so long at least as the war shall continue, as our commerce shall be embarrassed, and as our enemy shall persevere in his present system of measures. This is what I understood the hon. gent. to contend: and, whatever might be the worth of his argument, it surely was not open to the imputation which my right hon. friend found it convenient to attach to it; as if the hon. gent. had been guilty of the egregious absurdity of proposing for the imitation of this country, the political courage of the Dutch, and the military prowess of the Hamburghers. I am not, however, disposed to deny the assertion, which my right hon. friend has grounded upon this argument, that inferences are not to be conclusively drawn from the establishments of other countries, whether political or commercial, to our own. The principles of public credit are so much better understood, and so much more religiously observed in this country, the line of separation between the financial operations of the state, and the concerns of the national Bank, confounded too often by arbitrary governments, is here so distinctly marked, that it cannot be doubted but many general propositions are true of paper currencies abroad, which would be utterly inapplicable to the system of the Bank of England. The depreciation of the Austrian paper money, there fore, which has been cited  1109 and commented upon by my hon. friend near me (Mr. Huskisson,) is not precisely an example; it is not a counterpart of our actual situation: but it does afford a most useful warning; it shows how rapidly paper money sinks in value, when once power has been in any degree substituted for confidence; and how tremendously, when once the first impulse has been given, the force of the descent accumulates and increases. The depreciation of Austrian paper was not, in its origin, like that which we are now discussing; there was, in its origin, something of discredit, of a distrust (that is) of the solidity of the funds upon which the paper was issued. If solidity of funds, however, were alone sufficient to keep up the credit of a paper, even the assignats of France would not have fallen so soon and so rapidly in value. The rulers of France by whom that paper money was coined, affected to be surprised at the depreciation of securities, resting, as they contended, on foundations more solid than those of the Bank of England and calculated, like the paper of the Bank, to promote the prosperity of the country in which it circulated. Well and wisely did Mr. Burke, when, in the language of an orator, and in the spirit of a prophet, he foreshowed that series and succession of calamities, which the principles of the French revolution, in all its parts, must inevitably produce well and wisely did he describe those essential qualities of the paper of the Bank of England which constitute its real value. ""They (said he, speaking of the National Assembly) imagine, that our flourishing state in England is owing to Bank paper, and not the Bank paper to the flourishing condition of our commerce, to the solidity of our credit, and to the total ex-, elusion of all idea of power from any part of the transaction. They forget that in England not one shilling of paper money of any description is received but of choice; that the whole had its origin in cash actually deposited; and that it is convertible at pleasure, in an instant, and without the smallest loss, into cash again. Our paper is of value in commerce, because in law it is of none. It is powerful on change, because in Westminster hall it is impotent. In payment of a debt of 20l. a creditor may refuse all the paper of the Bank of England. Nor is there among us a single public security, of any quality or nature whatsoever, that is enforced by authority. In fact, it might easily be 1110 shown, that our paper wealth, instead of lessening the real coin, has, a tendency to increase it; that instead of being a substitute for money, it only facilitates its entry, its exit, and its circulation; that it is the symbol of prosperity, not the badge of distress. Never was a scarcity of cash and an exuberance of paper a subject of complaint in this nation."" These were the characteristics of the paper of the Bank of England, when Mr. Burke contrasted it with the assignats of France. Its convertibility into specie upon demand, was suspended by the act of 1797, on grounds which it is not now necessary to discuss. The suspension was, for a series of years, unattended with, any symptoms that indicated depreciation. And it must be our wish, as well as our interest, to believe, (what from reasoning also appears most probable,) that this suspension alone, if not followed up by excessive issue, might have endured, as long as the political circumstances of the state might have rendered its endurance necessary, without producing that effect. But if that effect has been produced, as seems to be established beyond the possibility of contradiction, let us not, instead of attempting to correct it, endeavour rather to palliate its evils, and to reconcile ourselves to its consequences. Even under the change produced by the temporary suspension of cash payments, let us remember, that the essential and fundamental principles upon which the character and the utility of Bank paper rest, are those described in the extract which I have just quoted from Mr. Burke. Let us not, under the pressure of what has been always considered as a temporary necessity, and in the despair of meeting what I trust is no more than a transitory and as yet a curable evil, abjure this language and these doctrines of Mr. Burke, and adopt in their stead the cant and sophistry of those against whom his arguments were directed. Far be it from me to imagine that between the notes of the Bank of England and the assignats of the National Assembly, there now exists that resemblance of which Mr. Burke in 1791 denied and disproved the existence! But in proportion as I am satisfied that the Bank note is of a different nature from the assignat, in that proportion do I dislike to bear them defended by the same arguments. ""Ce n'est pas l' assignat qui perd, c'est l'argent qui gagne,"" was the motto and the doctrine of  1111 a treatise, published in Paris during the reign of the National Assembly, for the purpose of maintaining the credit of assignats, by accounting for the difference between their nominal and exchangeable values. ""It is not the Bank note which loses, but the dollar which gains,"" is the argument by which we have heard the rise in the denomination of the dollar explained: ""It is not paper which has fallen, but gold which has risen,"" is the argument which has filled all the pamphlets and all the speeches which we have read and heard upon this subject. The arguments are identically and undistin-guishably the same: I wish that any of my honourable friends who maintain the undepreciated state of our paper currency, could satisfy me and the country that there is some essential difference in their mode of applying them. I wish they could show me that the doctrine of the French pamphlet might be false, while that of the English pamphlets and of their own speeches is true. I do not need to be reminded of the many essential differences in the circumstances of the two paper currencies. I am here speaking, not of the causes of depreciation, but simply of the fact. That assignats were discredited in all sorts of ways, no person doubts. But the price of the precious metals in those assignats was, after all, the evidence and the measure of their depreciation. The high price which other commodities bore in assignats, afforded, to be sure, strong suspicions of depreciation; but it proved the fact, and established the degree of that depreciation only as compared with the price for which the same articles could be obtained in gold or silver. I say this to guard myself against the imputation of disparaging Bank notes by comparing them with a currency so notoriously worthless and fraudulent. Paper currencies may be depreciated from various causes which have no resemblance to each other; but whatever be the causes of depreciation, the test of it is in all cases the same. On all these grounds, I own my entire, though unwilling, conviction that a deprestation of our paper currency does actually exist; that the permanently un-favourable state of the exchanges with foreign countries, is an indication and the long-continued high price of bullion at; home, the proof of it. I can at the same time most truly say, that I shall hold my-self infinitely indebted to any man who, 1112 by reasoning and argument, by reference to admitted facts and established principles, can bring me back from this most unsatisfactory conviction. No man set out in the examination of the subject with less disposition to arrive at this conclusion: and no man would more gladly find reasons that could satisfy his own mind for receding from it. I confess, however, that although I can make full allowance to others for the same unwillingness which I have felt myself, to believe in the fact of an existing depreciation, I am more alarmed than encouraged by the apparent disposition rather to escape from the avowal of this fact, than to controvert it. I cannot see, without concern, the constant flight from the point, at which the controversy really lies, to the war, to the harvest, to Portugal, and to Buonaparte; in short, to every imaginable topic, except those on which the discussion essentially turns. This may confuse and perplex the argument, by raising a crowd of images with which it has noelation. But as to the point at issue, it seems to me a confession of weakness rather than a display of strength. Still greater is my apprehension, when I hear what are the motives assigned for continuing the present state of oar currency, whatever it may be, rather than making any attempt to decide what that state really is, and, if necessary, to correct or to improve it. Some persons there are indeed so sanguine and extravagant as to deny altogether that either improvement or correction is necessary; or that the ideas which these words convey can be applicable to a system which they consider, not as an evil, but as a benefit. We have been told of ""localized"" currency, of an ""insulated"" circulation, as a blessing far out-weighing all the other advantages arising from our peculiar local situation; as something analogous to them; something which was wanting to complete the perfection of our insular character, and which we have fortunately stumbled upon by accident for I think no man has been hardy enough to say, that we could have or ought to have established it by design. One hon. gent. (Mr. Baring) only, I think, has gone back to the origin of the Bank Restriction in 1797, and has imputed to the great man who was the author of it, an intention of laying in that measure the foundation of a system of fraudulent finance, and of providing for an indefinite  1113 extension of the public expenditure abroad by retrenching the just value of the payment to the public creditor at home. This is the imputation brought forward by that hon. gent.: and, while I fully acquit my right hon. friend (the Chancellor of the Exchequer) of any participation in this sentiment, I cannot but express my regret that he should not have distinctly disclaimed it; especially as he thought proper to bestow such lavish and unqualified commendation upon the speech in which it was contained, and to declare in more large and positive terms than I think he would upon reflection be disposed to confirm, his concurrence in the general views and doctrines of that speech. But acquitting my right hon. friend altogether of the wildest and most extravagant of the tenets which have been advanced by persons who admit and admire a depreciated currency, I see cause of sufficient alarm in those which he has avowed and maintained. If the causes of the present state of our currency be, as he says, the unfavourable balance of our trade, and the necessary extent of our war expenditure; if so long as those causes continue to operate, gold must, as he contends, continue to flow out of the country; if nothing can contribute to recall it, except a turn of the exchanges in our favour; if that turn can never be produced, except either by the previous turn of the balance of trade in our favour, or by the reduction of our paper currency; if the balance of trade, having been turned against us by the anti-commercial decrees of our enemy, must continue against us till those decrees are repealed; and if, of the only other expedient for correcting the exchanges (viz. the reduction of out-paper currency), my right hon. friend, while he admits the efficacy to be probable, denies the application to be possible; I am afraid the result of this series of propositions, every one of which I collect from the speech of my right hon. friend, is, not only that we have no remedy for the present evil, but that we are likely to arrive at a term, when all our exertions for the safety of the country must cease, from our absolute inability to maintain them. The precious metals are necessary to feed and sustain our military operations abroad. In all former wars, what went out in bullion for military purposes, was replaced in the course of trade by fresh importations. But now, according to the 1114 argument of my right hon. friend, our commerce itself is but another drain for our bullion, and must continue so as long as the enemy pleases. The time, therefore, must come, when the stream, always flowing and never replenished, will be exhausted; and when consequently all the operations, whether of war or of commerce, to which it gave motion, will stand still. This, I beg it may be remembered, is not my statement: it is that which I collect from the speeches of those who profess to see nothing requisite to be set right in the present system of our currency. It would be a statement of complete despair, if there were absolutely no check in nature for the course and progress of the mischief. One check one only check there is; a check, as I should think, safe as well as effectual. But while we are comforted with hearing from my right hon. friend that such a check might, in hi"" opinion also, be effectual, we hear from him at the same time, that it would be absolute destruction to resort to it. In addition to these motives of policy, there are, as I have heard this night, not without astonishment and dismay considerations of justice, which preclude any systematic redaction of the amount of our paper currency. Such a reduction, it is argued, would change the value of existing contracts, and throw into confusion every species of pecuniary transaction, from the rent of the great landed proprietor down to the wages of the peasant and the artisan. Good God! what is this but to say, that the system of irredeemable paper currency must continue for ever? What is it but to say, that the debts incurred, and the contracts entered into, under the old established legal standard of the currency, including the debts and contracts of the state itself, are now to be lopped and squared to a new measure, set up originally as a temporary expedient; and that the sacredness of public faith, and the obligation of legalengagements, are to be conformed to the accidental and fluctuating derangement, and not to the antient and fixed rule, of our currency? If this be so, there is indeed no hope that we shall ever return to our sound and pristine state. This objection is of a nature lo propagate itself indefinitely. Every day new contracts must necessarily be made; and every day successively (as it is of the essence of depreciation to go on increasing in degree) at rates diverging  1115 more and more widely from the real standard from which we have departed. Every day, therefore, must interpose additional impediments to a return to the legal standard. Never did the wildest and most hostile prophesier of ruin to the finances of this country venture to predict that a time should come, when by the avowal of parliament, nominal amount in paper, without reference to any real standard value in gold, would be the payment of the public creditor. But still less could it ever be apprehended that such a system was to be built on the foundations of equity and right; that it would be considered as unjust to give to the paper creditor the real value of his contracts in gold, but just to compel the creditor who had trusted in gold, to receive for all time to come the nominal amount, whatever that might come to be, of his contract in paper. This proposition appears to me so, monstrous, and shows so plainly to what an extravagant and alarming length we are liable to be hurried, when once we have lost sight of principle and given ourselves up to the guidance of expediency, that I am sure this House ought to lose no time in pronouncing its opinion as to the maxims by which, for centuries, the currency of this country has been preserved in eminent purity and integrity; and in declaring its determination to acknowledge no others in the theory of our money system, and to look to a practical return to that system, not only as advantageous to the state, but as indispensable to its justice and its honour. For these purposes, it is in my opinion necessary, in the first place, to enter a distinct record of what is, in our opinion, the legal standard of our currency. I know not how this can be done with greater clearness and correctness than by adopting the first Seven of the Resolutions proposed by the honourable and learned chairman of the Bullion Committee. To these Seven Resolutions are opposed, and for them it is intended to substitute, the first of the Propositions of the right hon. gent. opposite to me. I should have no hesitation in affirming these first Seven Resolutions, if they stood simply and positively on their own merits: but when I find that we cannot get rid of them without admitting into their places Proposition so exceptionable as the first Proposition of the right hon. gent., and one which, when admitted, will bring in 1116 its train other propositions still more exceptionable one in particular (I mean the Third) absolutely repugnant (as it seems to me) to common sense; I consider the affirmation of the original Resolutions as doubly important, not only from what it will establish, but for what it will exclude. This is not the time to discuss the Propositions of the right hon. gent. Otherwise it would be easy to show that the doctrine of his first Proposition, which referring every thing relating to the money of the country exclusively to the prerogative of the crown, states as altogether equal and indifferent the exercise of that prerogative by the will of the crown alone, or with the concurrence of the two Houses of Parliament; that this doctrine, if not absolutely false in principle and in theory, (a question which I will not now discuss) is at least, in any practical view, and to any practical purpose, unsound: it is. incomplete, delusive, and dangerous; it states the prerogative, indeed; but does not state it as defined and regulated by law. This, however, is a part only of the objections to the right hon. gent.'s Proposition. There are others which I shall reserve till the moment, if unhappily that moment shall arrive, when it becomes itself the subject of substantive discussion. What I have now said, in my opinion is sufficient to disqualify it as a substitute for the precise and unimpeachable statement of the monetary system of this country as established by the joint authority of the Crown and Parliament, which is contained in the hon. and learned gent.'s first Seven Resolutions. If I do not go at large into these Resolutions for the purpose of explaining and defending the vote which I shall give in favour of them, it is because in the whole course of this debate I have not heard a single objection urged against them. It is singular that the whole skill of his antagonists should have been exnausted, not in attacking, but in evading his statement; that of a chain of reasoning which, if it could be loosened in a single link, would, I admit, fall to pieces, not a single link has been attempted to be loosened. It remains entire and unbroken, and connects undisputed premises with an inevitable conclusion. The eighth and ninth Resolutions of the hon. and learned gent, contain truisms which no man disputes; and which the right hon. gent. in proposing to substitute  1117 for them his second Proposition, only makes less completely true by the omission of one essential circumstance. The eighth Resolution states that the notes of he Bank of England are stipulations to pay on demand. The right hon. gent.'s second Proposition omits the words on demand.' Why this omission? It can hardly be accidental; it can hardly be without some meaning: and yet the right hon. gent. so far as I have heard, in the speech With which he introduced his Propositions, did not offer any thing to account for so singular an alteration. Is it possible that he can mean to say, that Bank-notes are not stipulations to pay on demand? It is perfectly true that the restriction law of 1797 suspends the fulfilment of this stipulation, and protects the Bank against the consequences of a refusal to fulfil it: but does not the right hon. gent. see the danger of confounding two things so different as the temporary suspension of the effect of an obligation, and the actual annulment of the obligation itself? I am almost sure that the right hon. gent, must, upon reflection, be aware of the perilous tendency of such a confusion. But in the mean time, forasmuch as a correct and complete definition is preferable to one which is undeniably and dangerously defective, I cannot hesitate to vote for the eighth and ninth of the original Resolutions, to the exclusion of the right hon. gent.'s most unnecessary and most suspicious amendment. The tenth of the original Resolutions contains a clear, indisputable, and (as I have before described it) inevitable conclusion, from the state of the law, as accurately laid down in the preceding Resolutions, coupled with the notorious and undisputed fact of the high price of bullion. The truth of the averment contained in this Resolution is not directly denied. The dispute is only whether that which is admitted to be true is not nevertheless unfit to be recorded. It is not denied that the exchangeable value of Bank-notes is at this moment considerably less than their denominative value, if those values respectively be measured in gold or silver; but it is disputed whether gold or silver be the fit measure of the value of Bank-notes. This is in effect the whole of the argument, not upon this Resolution only, but upon the whole question in dispute. It is the single point on which all our discussions turn. I have already discussed this point so 1118 much at length, and have so nearly (as I am afraid) exhausted the patient indulgence of the Committee, that I do not think myself at liberty here to recapitulate the arguments upon it. I will content myself with asking of those who maintain a contrary opinion, and particularly of the right hon. gent. (Mr. Vansittart) ""If the precious metals, and particularly that one which is the legal standard of the currency of the country, be not the proper measure of the value of that currency what is?"" The right hon. gent. has his answer ready in his third Proposition: and a most curious one it is. "" Public estimation"" is, according to the right hon. gent. the true standard measure of the value of a currency; and the common measure of the two parts of a currency as compared with each other. If I felt upon this question with the spirit of a partisan if I had been a member of the Bullion Committee, and were responsible for their Report, I should say, that the right hon. gentleman's third Proposition was absolutely beyond my hopes. Speaking impartially, I must say, that if I had seen this third Proposition any where but where it is, fairly printed and numbered in the right hon. gentleman's series, I should have thought it an invention of his antagonists, calculated to place the fallacy of his doctrine in the most glaring and ridiculous point of view, but carrying the licence of exaggeration rather beyond pardonable limits, and defeating its purpose, by the grossness of the caricature. I would have taken no other person's word than the right hon. gentleman's own, that he, a man of science, a man of practical knowledge and experience, was the author of this Proposition. This Proposition, however, is not now regularly before us. I think it absolutely incredible that it should ever be brought before us for our direct consideration and adoption. It-is now only to be viewed as the contrast and contradiction of the tenth Resolution of the hon. and learned gent.; as intended to divert us by the prospect of something better from sanctioning that Resolution. And how does it effect that purpose? By showingus that, if we will let that Resolution alone, and hot unsettle the public mind by resolving any thing at all about the measurement of the value of Bank-notes, there is already a sufficient rule for the just estimation of their value. What is that rule? ""Public estimation."" Good. And who is the party whose opinion is to be settled? The public. To  1119 whom do they appeal? To the House of Commons. The public opinion is divided; the public appeal to the House of Commons for judgment; and the House of Commons, after gravely hearing the arguments on both sides, delivers, not its own decision of the question in dispute, but a decree that the opinion of the public has already decided it. Is this (I do not say) wise, judicious, satisfactory? I ask if it be intelligible; if it be not a mockery of the public; a degradation of our own character, and an abdication of our own functions? Again I say, I cannot, will not believe that we shall ever be seriously called upon to vote this third Proposition. But even so, we must not leave this main point of inquiry undetermined, nor our determination upon it unrecorded. The tenth of the original Resolutions contains the just and indisputable inference from the known law and the acknowledged facts of the case. Till the indentures of the Mint be altered, and the statutes which sanction them repealed, definite weight of precious metal constitutes the true standard of our currency. By that standard while it subsists in law, every species of our currency must be measured. Measured by that standard, Bank notes have not at present a value equal to their denomination. Unless the premises can be denied, it is in vain to dispute the conclusion. And this conclusion, if it be true, it is our bounden duty solemnly to record. These ten Resolutions therefore expound the law of the currency; and establish the fact of the actual depreciation of that part of it, which consists in paper. Here I confess I should be contented to leave the matter: conceiving that the remedy to be applied to the evil may best be proposed by the executive government; and that the causes of it, though to my mind obvious and manifest, yet are not as capable of certain and demonstrative proof, as the tact of its existence. I have myself no doubt of the truth of the hon. and learned gent.'s Eleventh Resolution. But I am not prepared to affirm it by my vote. I think that unlike in this respect to those which have preceded it, it asserts more than it proves. And I think it implies a degree of blame upon the Bank, which I am not ready to impute to that body. When it is stated that the depreciation of bank notes is owing to an excessive issue, and that the excessive issue has been 1120 produced by a want of check and controul, it is difficult not to construe such a statement as imputing to the Bank a heavy responsibility both for the excess of their issues, and for a neglect of those precautions by which such excess might have been prevented. But the check and control which are said to have been wanting, may have been, and in point of fact were, in part at least, extrinsic to the Bank. The main check was the payment of their notes in specie upon demand: for the discontinuance of this check the Bank is obviously not responsible. If indeed I could agree with my right honourable friend (the Chancellor of the Exchequer) in considering the question of excess as independent of that of depreciation, and as capable of being satisfactorily proved or disproved otherwise than through the depreciation, I could not affirm the fact of an excessive issue without imputing to the Bank the blame of having intentionally produced that excess. But the check of cash payments once removed which was, as I apprehend, the only infallible guard against excess, I know of no test by which the Bank could ascertain the fact that their issues had become excessive, except by that of their paper having become depreciated. The degree and the long continuance of the unfavourableness of the exchange strongly indicate and the high price of bullion incontrovertibly proves, the depreciation; the depreciation proves the excess. But such being the order of the demonstration, it is not till the fact of depreciation was established that I could consider that of an excessive issue as proved: and it would not be until such excess should have been persevered in against better knowledge, that I should think it just to animadvert upon the conduct of the Bank in the terms of this Resolution. Besides, I confess I think it unnecessary. I cannot help being satisfied, that without any specific resolution on the subject of excess, the effect of this debate, should the first ten Resolutions be adopted nay, I cannot help hoping that the effect of the debate itself, will be to correct that evil. For this purpose, however, it is undoubtedly desirable, that the Bank should be disabused of some notions which it appears to entertain, and of others which have been suggested in this debate; at least if those notions are, as they appear  1121 to my understanding, entirely erroneous. "" It is impossible that there should be an excess in the issue of bank notes,"" say the Bank, ""because those notes are never issued except upon solid security the security of real mercantile transactions."" Surely, it cannot be necessary to show that although this may be an adequate precaution against loss to the Bank, it is none against an excessive issue. It surely cannot be contended that every mercantile transaction, that is to say, every object of commerce, may be represented to its full value id the paper currency of the country, and represented not once only, but as often as it changes hands, without any inconvenient augmentation of the mass of that currency. A. sells to B. a bale of cloth, or a hogshead of sugar, and receives from B. a bill of exchange payable in two months. Here is a bill founded upon a real mercantile transaction. A. carries B's bill to the Bank for discount; and a bank-note to the amount of the bill is sent into circulation. Next day B. transfers his goods to C. and receives from C. a similar bill of exchange. Here is another bill founded on a real mercantile transaction. Like the former, it is carried to the Bank; and, like it, is the cause of adding a' bank note of the same amount to the circulation. Is it not plain that this transaction may be almost indefinitely repeated, till the bale of cloth or the hogshead of sugar is represented an hundred fold in the currency of the country? The security of the Bank is not in the rule of its issue, but in the solvency of the several parties. This may guard their notes against depreciation from discredit; but what tendency has it to secure them from depreciation by excess? ""It is impossible,"" others have said, ""that there should be an excess, when the mass of property to be circulated in this country, the rents of land, the profits of trade, the expenditure of the State, and the receipt of the revenue, are grown and daily growing to an amount so much beyond all former experience."" ""The amount of the circulating medium,"" it is said, ""so far from having increased in a ratio equal to that of these' several enormous demands' for its employment, bears an infinitely smaller proportion to those demands than it has done at former periods of our history. It cannot therefore be in excess;"" This proposition 'has been' much dwelt upon by many gentlemen who have spoken in this debate: 1122 and the difficulty of dealing with it lies in his that on neither side of the comparison are what it assumes as data, fixed and certain; that on the one side the total amount of the currency of the country, including paper of all kinds, is necessarily unknown; and on the other side, who is there (as I have before had occasion to ask) that shall pretend to estimate with accuracy the aggregate amount of all the private transactions of the country? The peremptory inference that excess is impossible, is surely not to be drawn with confidence from premises necessarily conjectural. In one sense, indeed, which, however, I can hardly suppose to be intended, it may be true that there never can be any such thing as excess, or superabundance of currency in a country: it cannot be superabundant if you do not care for its depreciation. Suppose for instance ten millions sufficient to carry on all the transactions of the country fabricate fifteen millions of paper instead of ten, the whole fifteen will circulate: the only consequence will be, that the commodities for which it is exchanged will rise fifty per cent, in their nominal price. Make those fifteen millions twenty; the addition will in like manner be absorbed into the enhanced prices of commodities. Excess of currency cannot be proved to the conviction of those who will not admit depreciation to be the proof of it. But again, if we were to allow the accuracy and certainty of all the data that are assumed by those persons who have relied on this argument; to allow whatever amount they please for the pecuniary transactions of the country, public and private; to allow them to fix where they please, the amount of the currency; and to assume that its actual amount at the present moment, consisting, as it does, almost exclusively of paper, is not greater is even less than when it consisted in part, and in great part, of gold; still it would remain for them, before they could infer the impossibility of excess, to show, that there was no improved mode of carrying on the transactions of the country, which facilitated and quickened all pecuniary transfers, arid made a less quantity of currency perform what had required a greater amount before; it would remain, for them to show that the very substitution of paper for gold did not greatly contribute to this facility; that a bank note of one hundred pounds would not perform  1123 in a given space of time an infinitely greater number of operations in exchange of commodities than an equal sum in the more bulky and Jess transferable shape of guineas. That these or any other arguments can disprove the possibility of excess, I utterly deny, and I trust that the Bank has, by this time, ceased to believe. On the other hand, that the existence of excess can be proved by the converse of these arguments, or that any conclusive inference can be drawn from the positive amount of paper in circulation, or from the comparison of that amount, either with the amount, of currency in circulation at any former time, or with that of the pecuniary transactions, revenue and expenditure of the country, I do not pretend. The currency might be increased or diminished in any assignable degree, without affording any inference fairly conclusive upon the point in question, unless that diminution or increase were accompanied by a variation of its value. Whether that value has or has not varied, is therefore the sole question. It is the point from which we must return. And as it is one which is capable of being either proved or disproved directly; they who argue about it analogically, instead of directly, afford a strong indication of their own distrust in the soundness of their reasoning. That excessive issue has therefore been the cause of depreciation I entertain no doubt. And although for the reasons which l have given, I do not think it necessary to declare this fact in a distinct Resolution, I trust that the statement of principles in those Resolutions which precede, and those which follow, is sufficient to answer every practical purpose of such a declaration. The twelfth Resolution simply records a fact about which, there is no dispute the unfavourable state of the exchanges. The thirteenth Resolution attributes this unfavourable state of the exchanges, in a great measure, to the depreciation of the relative, values of the currency of this country, as compared with that of other countries; without however excluding the operation of other causes. The fourteenth declares it to be the duty of the Bank, under the present circumstances, to, take the state of foreign exchanges, as well as the price of bullion into their view regulating the amount of their issues. 1124 The twelfth Resolution requires no comment. To the thirteenth and fourteenth, however the right hon. gent. opposite me (Air. Vansittart) may object, my right hon. friend (the Chancellor of the Exchequer) must agree. He must agree at least, unless he thinks, cither that the depreciation of our paper currency is a good thing in itself; or that, being an evil, it is productive of good by which it is more than counterbalanced. He must agree to these Resolutions; for he admits that the reduction of the amount of Bank paper would have; tendency to set right the exchanges. The state of the exchanges therefore is not in his opinion, as it is in that of others, wholly independent of the amount of the Bank, issues, and unaffected by it. If the exchanges are affected by the issues of the Bank, and affect in their turn, as they undoubtedly do, and as by some they are thought to do exclusively, the price of gold, and the general commercial interests of the country, the state of the exchanges cannot be altogether a matter of indifference in any question respecting the amount to which the bank issues should be carried. But the Bank have told us distinctly, that they do not advert to the exchanges with a view to regulate their issues. Their reason for not doing so they stale to be, that they do not consider the amount of their issues, and the state of the exchanges, as having any connexion, or bearing in any degree upon each other. In this opinion my right honourable friend (the Chancellor, of the Exchequer) thinks, as I think, that the Bank is wrong. He must therefore naturally agree with me in the necessity and expediency of correcting their error on this subject. Consequently I can anticipate no objection on his part to the twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth Resolutions. The fifteenth Resolution cannot be opposed by any man, who is not prepared to go the full length of the argument, that excess of paper currency is a thing of it self physically impossible, or, who is not desirous of converting the temporary suspension of cash payments into a permanent system. With these exceptions, every man must concur in the opinion, that the convertibility upon demand: of paper into coin is the only permanent and certain security against excess in the issue of paper; and must be anxious that, this principle, having been called in question, should be unequivocally affirmed, More especially  1125 must those persons be anxious for such an affirmation, who are prepared to vote for the last but one of the propositions of the right hon. gent. opposite to me (Mr. Vansittart); in which the expediency of returning to cash payments as quickly as possible, is so clearly and properly recognized I have already declared that I am one of those who concur in that proposition; and who would not object to voting at the same time for the concludirig proposition of the right hon. gent. which declares the inexpediency of reverting to cash payment"" at the present moment: but to those propositions, the Resolutions of the hon. and learned gent. (Mr. Horner) which I have already discussed, and especially this fifteenth Resolution, appear to me to form the best and most natural introduction. I now come to the concluding Resolution of the hon. and learned gent., and that with respect to which alone I differ from him to the extent of being compelled to vote against it. Agreeing with him as I do in all the main principles of his argument; admitting as I do, that the evil which he has denounced exists, and that he and his fellow-labourers have traced it to its source; admitting also that it requires remedy; I am certainly bound to explain why I cannot go along with him in his practical conclusion: and I will endeavour to explain myself upon this point, I hope to his satisfaction. The object of this Resolution is to change the term of the restriction upon cash payments at the Bank; and to ascertain, though not necessarily to shorten, the period of its duration. I have already said, that throughout the whole of this business, I consider the Bank as entirely passive. The restriction was originally imposed upon them by Parliament. By Parliament it was renewed more than once during the continuance of the former war, alter the Bank had declared its readiness to pay in cash; by Parliament it was re-enacted at the re-commencement of the war; and with a policy, which I deeply regret, but for which the Bank is he way answerable, was made commensurate in its continuance with the continuance of the war. If therefore the error has prevailed of considering this as a war measure, it is not to the Bank, but to Parliament, that this error ought to be imputed. The Bank Was taught by Parliament so to consider the subject; and it is hard to visit upon the 1126 Bank, the consequences of our own error. Nothing can be more obvious than that, concerning its own interests as a commercial corporation, the Bank may have thought itself not only warranted but obliged to adopt a different course of conduct, with a view to prepare for the resumption of cash payments at a period of six months after a definitive treaty of peace, from that which they would have adopted with a view to a different period, definite in point of time, but independent of the consideration of peace or war. It is possible that, taking the colour of their opinions from Parliament, and considering the war as the cause of the restriction, and peace, whenever it should be made, as certain to supersede the necessity of it, they may have thought that the six months, which are to intervene between the conclusion of the definitive treaty and the call upon them for cash, would be sufficient to enable them to replenish their coffers; however they might have exhausted them in the mean time, by a liberal assistance to government, and however they might have omitted to replace their issues by the purchase of gold in the market. I do not say that such has been the conduct of the Bank: I say, that if such has been their conduct, it is perfectly natural and excusable. We know, indeed, in point of fact, that they have omitted to purchase bullion. I regret this because I think that continued purchases, on their part, would have tended to keep their notes and the precious metals more nearly on a par. But we have nothing to do with the policy On which the Bank conducts its own private concerns; we have no right to examine into the state of its coffers; and it would be highly improper and mischievous to do so. We had a right to require, before the Bank restriction, payment of their notes in specie on demand: that right we have voluntarily foregone for purposes, and with a view to interests not of the Bank, but of our own; and all that we have now strictly aright to require of the Bank, is that it shall be ready to resume its cash payments at the period which Parliament has fixed for that resumption. It would, therefore, in my opinion, be unjust to shorten by any compulsory measure the duration, or to change the nature of the term for which the restriction has been enacted. But I also think the change would be impolitic as well as unjust. I am for ad-  1127 hering to our bargain; although I do not think it a very wise one. I am afraid, that if we proposed to alter it for our own convenience, we should not only not obtain our object, but, by throwing loose the terms of the existing agreement, should risk the non-performance of that agreement when the period for exacting it arrives. That our first object might be defeated by (he Bank, if we could suppose that the directors of the Bank (which, however, I am very far from believing) were capable of defeating it by design, is sufficiently obvious. But even innocently, and with the sincerest desire to conform themselves to the expressed wish of Parliament, the Bank directors, suddenly driven out of the course which they may have adopted in reliance upon the former act, by this new and unlooked-for interposition, might, by the very measures which that interposition Rendered necessary, create a state of things which would oblige us hastily to recall it. We read in the Report of the Bullion Committee of the alarming effects of a too sudden and violent contraction of the Bank issues. We feel at the present moment the ill effect of an uncontrolled augmentation of them. The result of the present discussion must and will be (I cannot doubt but it will) to check the latter evil: but I am afraid, that, by fixing peremptorily a new period for opening the cash coffers of the bank, we should incur a danger of the former kind to an extent of which the consequences cannot be foreseen. Of these consequences, that which I most apprehend, which I think the most certain, and consider as the most to be deprecated, would be that, the act under which the restriction is now limited being repealed, the new limitation would be found impracticable; and that we should thus he left without the prospect of any definite period for the restoration of the sound and natural state of our currency. In the present state of this discussion, I shall be well contented if we come out of the committee with the principles of our money system unequivocally recognized, and with the prospect of our return to the practice of them only not impaired. Of that issue I will not despair. For the rest, I am willing to leave to the good sense ""and good intentions of the Bank, and to the suggestions of the executive government, that gradual retrenchment of the excess of our paper currency, which can 1128 alone correct those evils, the existence of which we all agree in acknowledging. I impute nothing to the Bank for whatever has taken place amiss: I rely confidently on their disposition to amend it. As to the government, I am quite sure, that whatever may be the present feelings of my right hon. friend, no obstinate attachment to preconceived opinions will prevent him from looking at the whole subject with impartiality, or from setting himself with that solicitude which its importance demands to review and to re-consider-all the facts and arguments connected with it, and to adapt his conduct (his counsel, rather for it is in that way alone that he can properly influence the Bank) to whatever may after full deliberation be his own final and sincere conviction. I think that, after full deliberation, he cannot be convinced but aright. If I am asked, ""What will you then be satisfied, after all, with doing nothing? with leaving things as they are?"" I answer We the House of Commons do perhaps as much as at this moment we can do, we do something practical some' thing essentially useful and important, if we strengthen, by a declaration of our opinion, the foundations of the money system of the country; if we re-establish the credit of the true standard of our currency, at a moment when it is attempted to be brought into doubt and disrepute. The Bullion Committee will not have sat in vain, if its Report shall have recalled the attention of parliament to that system, and that standard, which it was never the intention of Parliament to abandon. Nor will this House have misspent its time, if at the conclusion of this long and anxious investigation, it shall give its sanction to the principles of the Bullion Committee, so far as the system of our money and the standard of our currency are concerned, even although it may withhold that sanction from the practical measure which the Report of the Committee recommends."	241.0	1811.0	1810	[('ample', 'ample', ['positive', 'JJ']), ('best', 'best', ['positive', 'JJS']), ('light', 'light', ['negative', 'JJ']), ('important', 'important', ['positive', 'JJ']),

54561	54561	S2V0018P0-00201	1828-02-07	STATE OF THE COURTS OF COMMON LAW.]	Mr. Brougham		"Mr. Brougham rose, and addressed the House as follows: *  * Inserted, by Mr. Brougham's permission, from the original edition, printed for H. Colburn. 128 In rising to address the House upon one of the most important subjects that can possibly be submitted to the legislature, I feel at the same time deeply impressed with the conviction, that it is also one of the most difficult, and certainly the largest, that could engage its attention. I am aware that I stand engaged to bring before you the whole state of the Common Law of this country; the Common Law I call it (in contradistinction to Equity), with the view of pointing out those defects which may have existed in its original construction, or which time may have engendered, as well as of considering the remedies appropriate to correct them. Nothing, I do assure you, at all strengthens and bears me up under the pressure of this vast and overwhelming burthen, but a conviction of the paramount importance, nay, the absolute necessity, of no longer delaying the inquiry, or postponing the needful amendments; and the intimate persuasion I feel, that I shall be able so to deal with the subject (such is my veneration for all that is good in our judicial system, and my habitual respect for those in whose hands the administration of it is placed), as neither to offend the prejudices of one class, nor vex the personal feelings of another. But I feel a confidence, also, which is unspeakable, resting on another ground. I come not here to raise cavils before men, ignorant of the details and niceties of the profession I belong to, and who, in that unavoidable ignorance, would be unfit judges of their merits; I am determined to avail myself in no respect of their situation, or of the absence of the learned body of the profession, for the sake of a futile and pitiful triumph over what is most valuable in our jurisprudence. I am comforted and confirmed in my resolution, from the accidental circumstances that have joined me, in some sort, to the administration of the law, in which I have had so considerable an experience, I have seen so much of its practical details, that it is, in my view, no speculative matter whether for blame or praise. I pledge myself, through the whole course of my statement, as long as the House may honour me with its attention, in no one instance to make any observation, to bring forward any grievance, or mark any defect, of which I am not myself competent to speak from personal knowledge. I do not merely say, from observation as a bystander; I limit myself still further, and confine myself to  129 causes in which I have been counsel for one party or the other. By these considerations, emboldened on the one hand, and, on the other impressed with a becoming sense of the arduous duty I have undertaken in this weighty matter, I will, without further preface, go on, in the first place, to state the points which I intend to avoid. I shall omit Equity, in every branch, unless where I may be compelled to mention it incidentally, from its interference with the course of the Common Law; not that I think nothing should be done as to Equity, but because in some sort it has been already taken up by parliament. A commission has sat, and inquired into the subject, and produced a Report, received, though not yet acted upon. The noble and learned lord, who presides in the other House, has announced his intention of preparing a bill, founded on that Report. I may also add, that the subject has, to his own great honour, and to the lasting benefit of the country, been for many years in the hands of my hon. and learned friend, the member for Durham (Mr. M. A. Taylor): it is still with him, and I trust his care of it will not cease. For reasons of a like kind, I pass over the great head of Criminal Law. That inquiry, happily for the country, since the time when first sir Samuel Romilly (a name never to be pronounced by any without veneration, nor ever by me without sorrow) devoted his talents and experience to it, has been carried forward by my hon. and learned friend, the member for Knaresborough (sir James Mackintosh) with various success, until at length he reaped the fruit of his labours, and prevailed upon this House, by a narrow majority, to lend its attention towards so great a subject. On a smaller scale, on one indeed of a very limited nature, these inquiries have been followed up by the right hon. gentleman, who is now again Secretary of State for the Home Department. It is not so much for any thing he has actually done, that I feel disposed to thank him, as for the countenance he has given to the subject. He has power, from his situation, to effect reforms, which others hardly dare propose. His connections in the Church and State, render his services in this department almost invaluable. They have tended to silence the clamours that would otherwise have been raised against the reform of the law, and might possibly have proved fatal 130 to it. If (which I do not believe) he intended to limit his efforts to what he has already accomplished; if he were disposed to say, ""Thus far have I gone, and no further can I go with you,"" the gratitude of his country would still be due to him in an eminent degree, for having abashed the worst enemies of improvement, by his countenance and support. But I trust he will gain direct the energies of his mind to the great work of reformation, and bestow his exertions over a wider space Another reason for avoiding this part of the subject altogether is to be found in the nature and objects of the Criminal Law. I do not think it right to unsettle the minds of those numerous and ignorant classes, on whom its sanctions are principally intended to operate. It might produce no good effects if they were all at once to learn, that the Criminal Code in the mass, as it were, had been sentenced to undergo a revision that the whole penal code was unsettled and about to be remodelled. I intend also to leave out of my view the Commercial Law. It lies within a narrow compass, and it is far purer and freer from defects than any other part of the system. This arises from its late origin. It has grown up within two centuries, or a little more, and been formed by degrees as the exigency of mercantile affairs required. It is accepted, too, in many of its main branches, by other states, forming a code common to all trading nations, and which cannot easily be changed without their general consent. Accordingly, the provisions of the French Civil code, unsparing as they were of the old Municipal-law, excepted the law merchant, generally speaking, from the changes which they introduced. Lastly, Sir, the law of Real Property forms no immediate subject of my present consideration: not that I shall not have much to propose intimately connected with it, and many illustrations to derive from it; but I am flattered with the hope, that the Secretary for the Home Department intends himself, on this subject, to bring forward certain measures, by which the present system will eventually undergo salutary alterations; and I cannot help here saying, that whatever the Criminal Law owes to the persevering and enlightened exertions of the late sir Samuel Romilly, and of his successor, the member for Knaresborough (sir James Mackintosh), I am  131 sure an almost equal debt of gratitude has been incurred on the part of the law of Real Property, to the honest, patient, and luminous discussion which it has received from one of the first conveyancers and lawyers this country could ever boast of. My hon. and learned friend (the Solicitor General) opposite, and those members of the House who are conversant with our profession, will easily understand, that I can only allude to Mr. Humphreys. With these exceptions, which I have now stated as shortly as I was able, and for which I shall offer no apology, because it was absolutely necessary that I should begin by making the scope of my present purpose understood, I intend to bring all the law as administered in our courts of justice, under the review of the House; and, to this ample task, I at once proceed. But I shall not enlarge, after the manner of some, on the infinite importance and high interest which belong to the question, and the attention which it, of right, claims from us, whether considered as a branch of the government, or as the representatives of the people, or as a part of the people themselves. It would be wholly superfluous, for every one must at once admit, that, if we view the whole establishments of the country, the government by the king, and the estates of the realm, the entire system of administration, whether civil or military the vast establish merits of land and of naval force by which the state is defended our foreign negotiations, intended to preserve peace with the world our domestic arrangements, necessary to make the government respected by the people or our fiscal regulations, by which the expense of the whole is to be supported all shrink into nothing, when compared with the pure, and prompt, and cheap administration off justice throughout the empire. I will indeed make no such comparison; I will not put in contrast things so inseparably connected; for all the establishments formed by our ancestors, and supported by their descendants, were invented and are chiefly maintained, in order that justice may be duly administered between man and man. And, in my mind, he was guilty of no error he was chargeable with no exaggeration he was betrayed by his faney into no metaphor, who once said, that all we see about us, King, Lords, and Commons, the whole machinery of the State, all the apparatus of the system, and its varied workings; ended in 132 simply bringing twelve good men into a box. Such the administration of justice is the cause of the establishment of government such is the use of government: it is this purpose which can alone justify restraints on natural liberty it is this only which can excuse constant interference with the rights and property of men. I then invite you, Sir, to enter upon an unsparing examination of this mighty subject: I invite the House to proceed with me, first of all into the different Courts to mark what failures in practice are to be found in the system, as it was originally framed, as well as what errors time has engendered by occasioning a departure from that system; and then to consider, whether we may not, safely, and usefully, apply to these defects remedies of a seasonable and temperate nature, restoring what is decayed, if it be good lopping off what experience has proved to be pernicious. i. In the first place, let us proceed to the Courts in Westminster-hall, and observe the course pursued in them. The House is aware that, whatever may have been the original of our three great Common Law courts, they now deal with nearly the same description of suits, and that, though the jurisdiction of each was at first separate, and confined within very narrow limits, their functions are now nearly the same. The jurisdiction of the court of King's-bench, for example, was originally confined to pleas of the Crown, and then extended to actions where violence was used actions of trespass, by force; but, now, all actions are admissible within its walkthrough the medium of a legal fiction, which was adopted for the purpose of enlarging its authority, that every person sued is in the custody of the marshal of the court, and may, therefore, be proceeded against for any personal cause of action. Thus, by degrees, this court has drawn over to itself actions which really belong to the great forum of ordinary actions between subject and subject, as its name implies, the court of Common Pleas. The court of Common Pleas, however, in its exertions for extending its business, was not so fortunate as its rival; for, though it made a vigorous attempt under lord chief justice North with that view, it never was able to obtain cognizance of the peculiar subject of King's-bench jurisdiction Crown Pleas. I hope, Sir, the House will allow me, for the sake of a little divertissement in the  133 midst of so dry a matter, to state the nature of the contest between the two courts, as described by Roger North in his biography of Lord Keeper Guildford; a work of amusement, with which I am sure my learned friend (the Solicitor-general) is as well acquainted as he is with the subtleties of his profession. It appears from his account, that the courts of King's-bench and of Common Pleas had quarrelled as to their respective provinces; for he says, ""The court of Common Pleas had been outwitted by the King's-bench, till his lordship came upon the cushion, and that by our artifice in process called ac etiams. His lordship used the same artifice in the process of his court, where it was as good law as above. But Hale exclaimed against it, and called it altering the process of law; which very same thing his own court had done and continued to do every day.""* In another place he tells, ""The courts being upon terms of competition, the King's-bench outwitted in the Common Pleas:"" and how the latter invented a shift against the King's-bench, ""There,"" says he, ""the Common Pleas thought they had nicked them. But the King's-bench was not so sterile of invention as to want the means of being even with that device,"" and he shews how concluding with this remark ""The late chief justice, sir Orlando Bridgman, and his officers of the Common Pleas, gave this way of proceeding to the King's bench very ill language, calling it an arbitrary alteration of the form of legal process, and utterly against law. But the losers might speak; they got nothing else; and the Triccum in lege, carried it for the King's-bench; which court, as I said, ran away with all the business.""+ The Exchequer has adopted a similar course; for, though it was originally confined to the trial of revenue cases, it has, by means of another fiction the supposition, that every body sued as a debtor to the Crown, and further, that he cannot pay his debt, because the other party will not pay him, opened its doors to every suitor, and so drawn to itself the right of trying cases, that were never intended to be placed within its jurisdiction. The first state of the courts being that of distinct jurisdiction, then, of course, this * North's Lives of Lord Keeper Guildford, &c. vol. 1, pp. 130,203. + Ibid. 134 separation of provinces was praised, therefore all distinction became obsolete, and then the conflict and competition were as much commended; and with far greater reason, if it were real; but it is almost purely speculative. In the first place, the court of Common Pleas shuts its doors to many practitioners of the law, requiring that a certain proportion of fees should be advanced at a much earlier stage in the cause, than is customary in the other courts. And who is it that must advance this money? Either the attorney himself, if it be his own cause, must pay the money out of his own pocket, or, if he is acting as agent for a country practitioner, he must begin by laying out the money long before he can draw upon his employer for reimbursement; and he is not, in all cases, sure of being repaid for these advances. In the second place, clients and their attornies are induced, not to carry causes into the Common Pleas, by the strict monopoly that exists in the advocates of that court. I have every wish to speak with all respect of the learned persons who there engross the practice; but as, no doubt solicitors will have their favourites, and as possibly their clients may also have their favourites, the practice not being open to all barristers, prevents many suitors from resorting to a court where no one can be employed for them, at least in term time, except he be a sergeant; and, great as the learning of that body is known to be, well founded as their reputation is, for skill and for zeal, as well as for legal knowledge, yet the exclusive right which they exercise operates to keep away business from the court, and thus it has happened, both that other advocates seldom practise there at Nisi Prius where the court is open, and that much fewer suits are carried to the Common. Pleas than to the King's-bench. The causes which thus operate to shut the doors of that court must be removed before it can hope to have its fair share of practice. The Exchequer, in like manner, has its drawbacks, though they operate in another way. There is one reason why, as at present constituted, it cannot do much business, or have the high reputation which it ought to enjoy; I mean the mixture of various suits which are cognizable in it. It is, in fact, a court of all sorts of equity and of law of revenue law, and of ordinary law of law between subject and subject, as well as of law between the subject and the Crown. This makes suitors, seeing the  135 business done in so many different ways, come to the conclusion that it is not well done in any: I do not by any means assert, that this is a correct opinion, at the present time; because the judges and the barristers employed in that court, do not, I am convinced, yield to any body of professional men in their knowledge of equity and law. There are to be found on its bench, highly distinguished equity, and common lawyers; men of known legal talents, and the greatest experience, both in Chancery practice, in Nisi Prius, and in Criminal law. In what, therefore, I have said, I refer merely to that species of public opinion, which, whether right or wrong, has been engendered by the constitution of the court; I refer, also, to the natural tendency of a jurisdiction, thus open to such a variety of jurisprudence, to degenerate into inaccuracy, or want of effective skill in each department. But there is another and more obvious reason why this court does not obtain so much business as the others; I mean the limited number of attornies belonging to and allowed to practise in it. If there is cause to complain, as I have been doing, of the monopoly among the advocates attached to the Common Pleas, there is much more cause for a similar complaint touching the attornies in the Exchequer. The practitioners in that court are four attornies and sixteen clerks, and none others are allowed to practise there: if a country attorney wishes to take his cause thither, the only mode by which he can do so, is to employ one of the privileged attornies of the court, and divide with him the profits of the suit. It is needless to say, that such a system has, of necessity, a tendency at once to shut the doors of the court of Exchequer against suitors. What, then, is the natural consequence of those restrictions which prevent suitors from approaching the courts of Common Pleas and Exchequer? Why, it is this wherever there is but little business done in any court, those in power are induced not to place the strongest judge in that situation; then, the small portion of business to be done, renders the judge less fit for his office, and so, by action and reaction, while the little business makes the bench and the bar less able, the inferior ability of the court still further reduces that little business. I am here speaking of past times, but with a view, however, to what may occur at a future period. We 136 may not always have the bench so well filled as it is at present. The time may come when, if a judge were to be made, in consequence of political influence, who was known not to be capable of properly filling the office, it may be said by those who supported him, ""Oh, it does not matter send him to the court of Exchequer there is nothing to do there."" Thus, the small portion of business transacted the suspicion originating in the general mixture of suits, carried on in different ways, that the business is not well done, the monopoly of attornies, together with several other causes, occasions this court to be the least frequented of any: indeed, it has now scarcely any thing to engage its attention. The judges do not sit for more than half an hour some mornings, and there are hardly ever on the paper more than six or seven causes for trial after term: a dozen would be considered a large entry; when I well remember lord Ellenborough having five hundred and eighty-eight set down for trial in London only; and the present lord chief justice lately had on his paper no less than eight hundred and fifty untried causes. I mention this to support my proposition, that there is not really a free competition between the different courts. To say, in the circumstances which I have stated, that suitors have a free access to all the courts equally, is a fiction an assertion adapted to what ought to be, perhaps to what is intended, but not founded on the fact. Experiments have been tried to lighten the business of the court of King's-bench; but I do not find that any of them have answered the purpose for which they were instituted. The first of these attempts was made in the year 1821, when it was arranged, that the chief justice should sit in one court, and a puisne judge in another, at the same time; but never did any arrangement fail more completely. The court in which the puisne judge sat remained almost idle; while the other court was as constantly preferred, and nearly as much overloaded as before. Little else was effected but a great inconvenience both to practitioners and suitors, by the passing and repassing from court to court. In fact, it is not in the power of the courts, even were all monopolies and other restrictions done away, to distribute business equally, as long as the suitors are left free to choose their tribunal. There will always be a favourite court; and the cir-  137 cumstance of its being preferred tends to make it more deserving of preference; for if the favour towards it began in mere caprice, the great amount of business draws thither the best practitioners, to say nothing of judges; and the better the court, the greater will be its business. The same action and re-action will operate favourably, which I before shewed in its unfavourable effects, where a court was declining. ""Possunt quia posse videntur."" The experiment of 1821, having failed entirely, was not repeated. Another attempt has subsequently been made to relieve the court of King's-bench from the pressure of Term business, which must always bear a proportion to the Nisi Prius causes. This system is still going on, under the bill brought into the House by the present Chancellor, and of which, though he was induced to patronize it officially when Solicitor-general, I have reason to believe he never much approved. As this arrangement is compulsory, the client having no choice, it cannot well fail; but I heartily wish that it had failed, for it has done much mischief, and is certainly one of the worst changes that has ever taken place. It is true, the great pressure of business requires that something should be done; but it is equally true, that the right thing has not been adopted; for, where the King's-bench sits, with the chief justice presiding where the suitors resort where the bar is mustered where the public attend where all the counsel and attornies appear where the business is disposed of, as it ought to be, gravely and deliberately, with the eyes of mankind, with the eyes of the bar, as well as of the world at large, turned on the proceedings would not every one point to as the place in which all important legal questions ought to be decided? Would not any one, on the other hand, say, if another court were instituted in a sort of back-room, where three judges were sitting where the only persons present, beside the judges, were the counsel and attorney employed on either side of the cause that was pending where there was no audience, and the public eye was entirely directed not upon but from that to the other court would not any one, I ask, declare, that a court so constituted was the place in which the trifling business alone should be transacted: These, I think, would be but natural conclusions; and yet if the matter be stated exactly the 138 other way, it will be far nearer the truth. Of the really important business, as regards both its difficulty and importance to the law, and, indeed, to the suitor, a very large proportion is done in that back-room, and before these three judges; it is done in a corner, and, I may say, disposed of behind people's backs, with only the attendance of the attorney and barrister on each side, or, at most, with the presence of these and of the practitioners waiting for the next cause; and as the court is not frequented by the public any more than the profession, the business may certainly be said to be transacted without due publicity and solemnity. Thus we see, that by this arrangement, while the most interesting matter is overlooked, trifling business and points of no importance are brought forward with all possible observation: a motion for judgment as against the casual ejector, which is a motion of course a motion to refer a bill to the Master to compute principal and interest for judgment, as in case of a nonsuit and a thousand others, either of course or of the most trifling moment, are heard with the utmost publicity, before the whole court before the whole bar before the whole body of attornies before the whole public all of which might be settled by three judges in a corner, or by any one of them, or by any one of their clerks. The consequence is, that much time is lost to the full court, while the most important business special arguments, raising the greatest legal questions new trials, involving both matters of law and facts affecting large interests; and the crown-paper comprehending all the questions from Session, are obliged to be heard in the private and unsatisfactory manner I have described. I wish this system to be remedied, because it is a great and growing evil. It may be said, that the judges have not time to do the business. I deny that: there is time. Six hours a day, well employed, would be amply sufficient for all purposes. Let them come down to the court at ten o'clock in the morning and remain till four a period of six hours and the business may be done. But the system is at present extremely ill-arranged; and I will show how, without having any one to blame for it. The judges do their utmost, but they cannot remedy the evil without your aid. Let us see how their time is employed. They are supposed to come to the court at ten  139 o'clock, and to remain there till four. Surely this time may safely be pronounced to be sufficient for the transaction of their business. Then why have they not these six hours? There are two reasons for this: the one is, that bail must be taken by a judge. Mr. Justice Bayley, no longer ago than last Monday, was occupied the whole day in the Bail court; and this morning Mr. Justice Holroyd was not able to get away till twelve o'clock. I cite these instances of late occurrence, Sir, that you may see how closely I desire to keep by the actually existing state of the facts; but every week furnishes examples as well as the present. Thus, then, we see that in one case a whole day was lost, as far as regards a full court, and in another two hours, merely for the purpose of attending to trifling business, which might just as well be transacted by a commissioner, say a barrister of ten years standing. The other reason why the judges' time is mispent, arises from chamber business, which consists in the learned judges', the profound lawyers, the great magistrates, whose names I have made free to mention, sitting at Sergeants'-inn to hear the squabbles of attornies, and the clerks of attornies, among themselves, for barristers rarely attend: this takes them in rotation away from the court at three o'clock; so that, in fact, while their nominal time is from ten to four, they are only, on the average, really present from eleven or twelve to three, by which, instead of transacting business during six hours, the time is reduced to three, or at most four hours per day. And what, Sir, is the inference from all this? Obvious enough, certainly: for though it may be fairly contended, that the business of the Bail-court could be transacted by a commissioner, it may, perhaps, be doubted whether the Chamber practice does not require a judge to perform it, considering the points to be disposed of, and the persons to be controlled. There may, therefore, be a sufficient excuse for the arrangement, as matters stand at present, and yet a remedy may be necessary, as it may certainly be found in changing the circumstances. For my own part, I frankly confess that I am one of those who do not see the permanent excellence that some suppose to be vested in the number twelve; although lord Coke has spoken of it with a degree of rapture like that of the Algebraist, when he dwells upon the mar- 140 vellous powers of three or of nine. Twelve appears to be the number in his view, connected with all that is important and venerable, either sacred or profane, ancient or modem; but as I, unfortunately, do not possess the lights by which he was guided, I cannot help thinking that fourteen is a much better number than twelve, although it may not be so good for division; and although I cannot quote the fourteen Apostles, or the fourteen Tables, or the fourteen wise men. It will, indeed, divide by seven, which is more than can be said of twelve; but I rely not upon that superiority: it has another arithmetical quality of more importance. Though neither so divisable, nor so beautiful, nor so classical as twelve, it contains two more units than twelve beats it by two beyond all doubt or cavil; and that superiority recommends it for my present purpose. If twelve was beautiful in the days of lord Coke, fourteen must now, I fear, on this account take its place: for how any one can suppose, that twelve men can be able to do now, what they were only able to do centuries ago, is to me matter of astonishment; now, that they have seven or eight hundred causes to try, where they formerly had but thirty or forty, and when we know, that in the time of lord Mansfield, in the late reign, sixty was reckoned a large entry. This, Sir, is one of the illustrations which I would give to expose the heedless folly of those who charge the Bench and the Bar with causing all the delays in legal proceedings. How can it be expected, that twelve judges can go through the increased and increasing business now, when the affairs of men are so extended and multiplied in every direction, the same twelve, and at one time fifteen, having not been much more than sufficient for the comparatively trifling number of causes tried two or three centuries ago? But, there is a far more unthinking and more dangerous prejudice to which the same topic is a complete refutation I mean the outcry against innovation, set up as often as any one proposes those reforms, rendered necessary by the changes that time, the great innovator, is perpetually making. Tempus novatur rerum. Those who advise an increase of the judges beyond their present number are not innovators. The innovators are, in truth, those who would stand still while the world is going forward, who would only employ  141 the same number of labourers while the harvest has increased ten-fold, who, adhering to the ancient system of having but twelve judges, although the work for them to do has incalculably increased, refuse to maintain the original equality, the pristine fitness of the means to the end, the old efficiency and adequacy of the establishment; but they are not innovators who would apply additional power when the pressure exceeds all former bounds who, when the labour is changed, would alter the price of workmen employed, and thus preserve the proportions that originally existed in the judicial system who would most literally keep things as they were, or return them to their primitive state by restoring and perpetuating their former adaptation and harmony. The advantage of the addition I am recommending will become the more evident, when I consider the Welsh judicature, which I believe to be the worst that was ever established. Why should not the two judges be received amongst the others, and divide the Welsh circuits with the old ones? Not that I mean they should always take those circuits, but each might take them in his turn, as each in his turn might sit in the court of King's-bench and Common Pleas, and at the Old Bailey, besides dividing with the chiefs the sittings at Nisi Prius.* There are two observations, Sir, which I have to make relative to the judges generally, and which I may as well state now I am upon that subject. I highly approve of paying these learned persons by salaries, and not by fees, as a general principle; but, so long as it is the practice not to promote the judges, which I deem essential to the independence of the bench, and so long as the door is thus closed to all ambition, so long must we find a tendency in them, as in all men arrived at their resting place, to become less strenuous in their exertions than they would be if some little stimulus were applied to them. They have an irksome and an arduous duty to perform, and if no motive * The three puisne judges thus sitting in banco, the fourth would each term take bail, and insolvents and common motions in the morning, and chamber business afterwards; he would also take the sittings in term, a serious inconvenience at present; and he might dispose of certain classes of cases after term, as undefended causes and bills of exchange. 142 be held out to them, the natural consequence must be, as long as men are men, that they will have a disposition growing with their years to do as little as possible. I, therefore, would hold out an inducement to them to labour vigorously, by allowing them a certain moderate amount of fees: I say, a very moderate amount, a very small addition to their fixed salary, would operate as an incentive; and if this were thought expedient, it ought to be so ordered that such fees should not be in proportion to the length of a suit, or the number of its stages, but that the amount should be fixed and defined once for all, in each piece of business finally disposed of. I am quite aware that this mode of payment is not likely to meet with general support, especially with the support of the reformers of the law; but I give the suggestion as the result of long reflection, which has produced a leaning in my mind towards some such a plan. I throw out the matter for inquiry, as the fruit of actual observation, and not from any fancy that I have in my own head; but I may also mention, that some friends of the highest rank and largest experience in the profession, agree with me in this point, men who are among the soundest and most zealous supporters of reform in the courts of law. The other general observation that I have to make, with respect to the judges, is of a nature entirely different from the last which I have submitted to the House. The great object of every government, in electing the judges of the land, should be to obtain the most skilful and learned men in their profession, and at the same time, the men whose character gives the best security for the pure and impartial administration of justice. I almost feel ashamed, Sir, to have troubled you with such a truism; but the House will presently see the application I am about to make of it. Sorry am I to say, that our system of judicial promotion sins in both these particulars. Government ought to fill the bench with men taken from among the most learned lawyers and most accomplished advocates men who have both knowledge of the depths of jurisprudence and sagacity to apply it men who, from experience as leading advocates possess the power of taking large and enlightened views of questions, and of promptly seizing the bearings of a case. There cannot be a greater error than theirs  143 who fancy that an able advocate makes a bad judge; all experience is against it. The best judges in my time, with the exception of the present Lord Chief Justice, than whom no man can discharge his office more excellently and efficiently, have all of them been previously distinguished as advocates in the profession. But not only should the choice be unconfined by the legal acquirements and professional habits of the practitioner, there ought not to be, in choosing judges from the bar, any exclusion or restriction. He alone ought to be selected, in whom talent, integrity, and experience most abound, and are best united. The office of judge is one of so important and responsible a nature, that one should suppose the members of government would naturally require that they should be at liberty to make their selection from the whole field of the profession that they would themselves claim to have the whole field open to their choice. Who could suppose that a ministry would not eagerly seek to have all men before them, when their object must be to choose the most able and accomplished? But, although this is obvious and undeniable, and although the extension of the ministers' search cannot fail to be attended with the highest public advantage, as well as the greatest relief to him in performing his trust, is it the case that any such general and uncontrolled choice is exercised? Is all the field really open? Are there no portions of the domain excluded from the selectors' authority? True, no law prevents such a search for capacity and worth! True, the doors of Westminster-hall stand open to the minister! He may enter those gates, and choose the ablest and the best men there. Be his talent what it may, be his character what it may, be his party what it may, no man to whom the offer is made will refuse to be a judge. But there is a custom above the law a custom, in my mind, ""more honoured in the breach than the observance,"" that party, as well as merit, must be studied in these appointments. One half of the bar is thus excluded from the competition; for no man can be a judge who is not of a particular party. Unless he be the known adherent of a certain system of government, unless he profess himself devoted to one scheme of policy, unless his party happen to be the party connected with the Crown, or allied with the ministry of the day, there 144 is no chance for him; that man is surely excluded. Men must be on one side of the great political question to become judges; and no one may hope to fill that dignified office, unless he belongs to the side on which courtly favour shines; his seat on the bench must depend, generally speaking, on his supporting the leading principles of the existing administration. But perhaps, Sir, I may be carrying this distinction too far, and it may be said, that the ministers do not expect the opinions of a judge should exactly coincide with theirs in political matters. Be it so; I stop not to cavil about trifles; but, at all events, it must be admitted that, if a man belongs to a party opposed to the views of government; if, which the best and ablest of men, and the fittest for the bench, may well be, he is known for opinions hostile to the ministry, he can expect no promotion rather let me say, the country has no chance of his elevation to the bench, whatever be his talents, or how conspicuously soever he may shine in all the most important departments of his profession. No one, I think, will venture to deny this; or, if he do, I defy him to show me any instance in the course of the last hundred years, of a man, in party fetters, and opposed to the principles of government, being raised to the bench. No such thing has taken place that I know of. Never have I heard of such a thing, at least in England; though we have, perhaps, known instances of men who have changed their party, to arrive at the heights of their profession. But on this subject, desirous throughout of avoiding all offence, I will not press I do not wish to say a word about it. In Scotland, it is true, a more liberal policy has been adopted, and the right hon. gentleman opposite has done himself great honour by recommending Mr. Gillies, Mr. Cranstoun (now lords Gillies and Carrhouse), and Mr. Clerk, (lord Eldin) all as well known for party-men there as lord Eldon is here. Two other instances should be added the lord Chief Commissioner, who has had the signal happiness of presiding over the introduction of jury trial into his native country, and Mr. Cathcart and lord Alloway; though, unfortunately, their party has been what is now once more termed, the wrong side; but all men of the very highest eminence among the professors of the law. Now, when I quote these instances in Scotland,  145 I want to see examples of the same sort in England; for, however great my respect for the law and the people of the North may be, I cannot help thinking, that we of the South too, and our jurisprudence, are of some little importance, and that the administration of justice here may fairly call for some portion of attention. But, Sir, what is our system? If, at the present moment, the whole of Westminster-hall were to be called in the event of any vacancy unfortunately occurring among the chief justices, to name the man best suited to fill it, to point out the individual whose talents and integrity best deserved the situation whose judicial exertions were the most likely to shed blessings on his country can any one doubt for a moment whose name would be echoed on every side? No; there could be no question as to the individual to whom would point the common consent of those most competent to judge; but, then, he is known as a party-man, and all his merits, were they even greater than they are, would be in vain extolled by his profession, and in vain desiderated by his country. I reprobate this mischievous system by which the empire loses the services of some of the ablest, the most learned, and most honest, men within its bounds. And here let me not be supposed to blame one party more than another; I speak of the practice of all governments in this country; and, I believe, when the Whigs were in office, in 1806, they did not promote to the bench any of their political opponents; they had no vacancies in Westminster-hall to fill up, but in the Welsh judicature they pursued the accustomed course. Now, what is the consequence of thus carrying party-principles into judicial appointments? The choice of judges is fettered by being confined to half the profession; so that you have less chance of able men; and those you get are of necessity partisans, and, therefore, less honest and impartial. Why should the whole bench be Ministerial or Tory? No man can desire it to be so, for the purposes of judging over a community, far, very far, from being Ministerial or Tory. Yet it must be so, unless vacancies should occur during those visits of Whig ministries, ""few and far between,"" when once in a quarter of a century power falls upon that party, and then spreads its wings and flies from them in a few months. 146 Does not this arrangement instil into the minds, both of expectant judges and of men already on the bench, a feeling of party fatal to strict justice in political questions? I speak impartially, but unhesitatingly on this point, for it is perfectly notorious, that now-a-days, whenever a question comes before the bench, whether it be upon a prosecution for libel, or upon any other matter connected with politics, the council at their meeting take for granted that they can tell pretty accurately the leaning of the judges, and predict exactly enough which way the consultation of the judges will terminate, though they may not always discover the particular path which will lead to that termination. While the system I complain of continues, while you suffer it to continue, such a leaning is its necessary consequence. The judges have this leaning they must have it they cannot help having it you compel them to have it you choose them on account of their notoriously having it at the bar; and you vainly hope that they will suddenly put it off, when they rise by its means to the bench. On the contrary, they know they fill a certain situation, and they cannot forget by whom they were placed there, or for what reason. There is no doubt that the present judges will always discharge their functions with all the impartiality that any man can expect from them; but I speak without reference to individual habits or prejudices I speak of impressions which it is natural to expect must exist, where circumstances all conspire to create them; I speak, too, I must be allowed to say, quite disinterestedly. I cannot take the situation of a judge I cannot afford it. I speak not for myself, but for the country, because I feel it to be a matter of the deepest importance; and from what I have seen of the right hon. gentleman opposite (Mr. Peel), I really do hope to see this matter much more maturely weighed, than it has heretofore been. ii. I am afraid that I have already tired the House with the length of these details; but I must now take my leave, for a time, of Westminster-hall, and beg of you to mark, in the next place, the manner in which the law is administered in Wales. Why should Wales, because it happens to be termed the Principality, have the rights of property, and the personal privileges of the inhabitants, dealt with by different judges, and almost by a,  147 different system from that which is established in England? In England you have the first men men of the highest education and experience to sit in judgment on life and property. In Wales you have as judges, I will net say inferior men, but certainly not the very first, nor in any respect such as sit upon what Roger North calls the ""cushion in Westminster-hall."" I shall here show three great defects requiring a remedy most imperatively. Oftentimes, those gentlemen have left the bar, and retired to the pursuits of country gentlemen. I do not say that they are, for that reason, unfit for the office of judge, but still they cannot, be so competent as men in the daily administration of the law, and forming part of our Supreme courts. In some cases they continue in Westminster-hall which is so much the worse, because a man who is a judge one half the year, and a barrister the other, is not likely to be either a good judge or a good barrister. But a second and a greater objection is, that the Welsh judges never change their circuits. One of them, for instance, goes the Carmarthen circuit, another the Brecon circuit, and a third the Chester circuit but always the same circuit. And what is the inevitable consequence? Why, they become acquainted with the gentry, the magistrates, almost with the tradesmen of each district, the very witnesses who come before them, and intimately with the practitioners, whether counsel or attorney. The names, the faces, the characters, the histories, of all those persons are familiar to them; and out of this too great knowledge grow likings and prejudices which never can by any possibility cast a shadow over the open, broad, and pure path of the judges of Westminster-hall. Then again they have no retiring pensions, and the consequence is, they retain their salaries long after they have ceased to discharge, properly, the functions for which they receive them. Now mark the result of all this. On one of the Welsh circuits, at the last Spring Assizes, there were set down no more than forty-six causes for trial; and how many does the House think were disposed of? Only twenty, and of the twenty-six made remanets, are some that had stood over from the preceding assizes. It is evident enough what should be done here. If any of the judges of the Principality have become, from the extreme pressure of business on the one hand, or from any 148 physical cause on the other, inadequate to the discharge of the business which comes before them, pension them off if they be barristers yet remaining in Westminster-hall, and not fit to be raised to the bench, pension them off too: sure I am, that theirs will be the cheapest pension, nay, the most beneficial to the giver, ""being twice blessed,"" which has ever been bestowed. I verily think that the Principality would itself cheerfully pay this first cost of a better system. At all events, add two judges to your present number, and let them take, with the other twelve, their turn and share in the business of the country. Let the Principality of Wales be divided into two circuits, and then you will have the work well done, and quickly done, especially if you transfer the equity jurisdiction to the two courts of Westminster. In addition to this, from the accession to the present number of judges, the existing difficulties arising from the bail court and the chamber practice will be done away. And here, before passing to another head of judicature, the times of the circuits require a word or two. Not, perhaps, that this is of so much importance as the other defects I have already noticed, or shall presently touch upon; but it regards classes of great importance in themselves, judges, barristers, and solicitors; and it touches also, in no little degree, the conveniency of the community at large. I should be most glad to see that folly for really I cannot call it by any other name that absurd and vexatious folly of regulating Easter term by means of the moon, done away with. It is said by many that this would be difficult to reform. I see no such difficulty in the matter. Let the law returns be made certain, and leave the moveable feast to the church. I have no wish to interfere with the terms and seasons of the church; let those be regulated as you please; but let this inconvenience in the law be remedied, by making, for Easter and Trinity terms, like those for Michaelmas and Hilary, the returns on some certain days. I remember that when the late Mr. Erskine brought in a bill, in 1802, to fix Easter term, a learned judge delivered himself in print against the dangerous innovation; and some persons, alarmed by him, exclaimed, ""Only imagine the horror of attempting to change Easter term, when all Christians throughout the world have at present the unspeak-  149 able comfort of knowing that they are keeping this great festival upon one and the same day."" For my part, I have no wish to deprive them of this comfort, admitting it, as I do, to be unspeakable. The day upon which Good Friday falls may be determined as heretofore, that is, by the period of the full moon; by the same certain varying rule may Easter Sunday be fixed for all clerical purposes; but temporal business ought not to be sacrificed to these ideas of some undefined spiritual consolation. There is no inconvenience in Easter being moveable, but there is a very great inconvenience in making the law returns moveable. Why not, then, let the feasts of the Church remain changeable as heretofore, and the Terms of the courts, little enough connected with sacred things, fall at a stated period? Let it be counted, for example, from Lady-day, which is always on the 25th of March. But why, indeed, must we continue to count from Saints' days, now that we have happily a very Protestant country, more especially under the government of the present Commander-in-chief? Why preserve any Romish folly of this sort, and keep up a mere remnant of popery? Let Easter Term always begin on the 10th of April, or on the 5th, and the inconvenience will cease. It is the foolishest of vulgar errors to suppose, that, by how much the more you vex and harass the professors of the law, by so much the more you benefit the country. The fact is quite the reverse: for by these means you make inferior men, both in feelings, and in accomplishments, alone follow that profession out of which the judges of the land must be appointed. I should rather say, that by how much the more you surround this renowned profession with difficulties and impediments, calculated only to make it eligible for persons of mere ordinary education, and mere habits of drudgery, who otherwise would find their way to employment in tradesmen's shops, or at best in merchants' counting-houses by so much the more you close it upon men of talent and respectability, and prevent it from being the resort of genius and of liberal accomplishments. I apprehend, therefore, that, the convenience of the Bar is a matter which the legislature ought never to lose sight of, where it clashes not with the advantage of the suitor. The having the Terms which are moveable (Easter and Trinity), and 150 the circuit, and the long vacation, earlier by four or five weeks in one year, and later by four or five weeks in another, is a most serious inconvenience in itself, and quite unnecessary upon any principle. Only observe how hard the present system bears, for instance, upon those who, like myself, frequent the Northern circuit. It happened to me, that I did not get home till the 20th of September last year, having repaired to London on the 5th of October the year before, so that I was engaged in my profession for eleven months and a half, and having been gratified, out of the twelve months, by exactly one fortnight's vacation for needful repose, when I should have been obliged again to bend my steps towards Guildhall, appointed to open on the 9th of October, I naturally enough joined those who signed a requisition to my lord Tenterden, entreating him to defer the sittings. His lordship most handsomely expressed his willingness to meet the wishes of the gentlemen of the bar, kindly returning the affectionate respect which all who practise in his court bear to his person. He stated his satisfaction at being able to accommodate us, by sitting on Tuesday the 16th, instead of Tuesday the 9th, so that we obtained a week, for which we were thankful. My lord observed, that in the state of his paper he could grant us no more; indeed, such is his resolution manfully and honestly to despatch his business, that he seems to take as much interest in his work as others do in their relaxation. That his lordship's paper was far too heavy, there cannot be a doubt, and so it will always be. No one judge can get through the mass of causes entered in the King's-bench, trying them patiently and really hearing them to an end. Depend upon it, when more have been tried in the same time, they have been half heard and forced to compromise or reference. Now, if you will have two judges sitting at Nisi Prius at once, each of them taking a particular class of trials the one confining himself to the heavy business, and the other to bills of exchange, promissory note cases, and undefended causes generally the whole business of the court could be got through both thoroughly and with despatch; but, as the law now stands, it is utterly impossible for any man, in days consisting of no more than twenty-four hours, and labouring for eleven months in the year, to dispose of the business before  151 him. I say eleven months, for the Court, with the exception of a day or two of respite at Easter, and a week at Christmas, sat for eleven months last year, taking the circuits as part of the year's work. Another obvious distribution might be made without having two judges sitting together in one court. If, as all real actions have their domicile in the Common Pleas, actions which, in their nature, partake of real actions, as ejectments, trespass to try title, and so forth, might be carried there too. Other suits might be susceptible of a similar classification, as if actions respecting tithes, which are not frequent, bills of exchange, and promissory notes, were carried into the court of Exchequer. The lord chief Baron is allowed, by the 57th of Geo. 3rd, to sit in Equity and to hear alone, all causes and all motions in equity; but he never, in fact, does hear motions, although certainly no lawyer ever sat in that court more fitted to despatch any branch of Equity practice than is the present head of the Exchequer. Were he confined to the equity side, and were another judge, a common lawyer, appointed to preside on the law side of that court, you would have two effective courts, instead of one not very effective for either law or equity. The court of Chancery would be materially relieved by this arrangement; while the double good would be found of the business being better done both on the bench and at the bar, from that expertness which ever attends the division of labour; and of seasonable relief being afforded to both the judges and practitioners of the King's-bench, who would be restored to something of the leisure, at least the moderate professional employment, so favourable to the liberal pursuits and unfettered study of jurisprudence, which have always formed the most accomplished lawyers. iii. I now pass to the Civil Law courts; and their constitution I touch with a tender, and, I may say, a trembling hand, knowing that, from my little experience of their practice, I am scarcely competent to discourse of them; for I profess to speak only from such knowledge as I have obtained incidentally from practising in the two courts of Appeal, the high court of Delegates, and the Cock-pit, where I have been occasionally associated with the civilians. The observations I have to make on this part of the subject resolve themselves, entirely, into those which I would 152 offer upon the manner in which their judges are appointed and paid. In the first place, I would have them better paid than they are now; a reform to which I would fain hope there may be no serious objection on their part, averse, as I know them, generally, to all change. I think they are underpaid in respect of the most important part of their functions. The judge of the high court of Admiralty, who has the highest situation, or almost the highest, among the judges of the land (for there is none of them who decides upon questions of greater delicacy and moment, in a national view, or involving a larger amount of property) this great dignitary of the law has 2,500l. a-year salary only. The rest of his income is composed of fees, and these are little or nothing during peace. But, then, in time of war, they amount to seven or eight thousand per annum. I profess not to like the notion of a functionary, who has so many calls, as the judge of the Admiralty court, for dealing with the most delicate neutral questions for drawing up manifestos and giving opinions on these questions, and advising the Crown in matters of public policy bearing on our relations with foreign states; I like not, I say, the notion of such a personage being subject to the dreadful bias (and here, again, I am speaking on general principles only, and with no personal reference whatever) as he is likely to receive from the circumstance of his having a salary of 2,500l. per annum only, if a state of peace continue, and between ten or eleven thousand a year, if it be succeeded by war. I know very well, Sir that no feeling of this kind could possibly influence the present noble judge of that court; but I hardly think it a decent thing to underpay him in time of peace, and still less decent is it, to overpay him at a period when the country is engaged in a war. I conceive that it may not always be safe to make so large an increase to a judge's salary dependent upon whether the horrors of war or the blessings of peace frown or smile upon his country to bestow upon one, eminently mixed up with questions on which the continuance of tranquillity, or its restoration when interrupted, may hinge, a revenue, conditioned upon the coming on, and the endurance of hostilities. The other remark, which I have to offer on these courts, I would strongly press  153 upon the consideration of the House; it relates to the mode in which their judges are appointed. Is it a fit thing, I ask, now, when Popery is no longer cherished or even respected, indeed hardly tolerated, among us that one of its worst practices should remain, the appointment of some of the most eminent judges in the Civil Law courts by prelates of the Church? I except, indeed, the judge of the high court of Admiralty, because his commission proceeds from the Lord High Admiral; but I speak of all those who preside in the Consistorial courts who determine the most grave and delicate questions of spiritual law, marriage, and divorce, and may decide on the disposition by will of all the personalty in the kingdom. Is it a fit thing that the judges in these most important matters should be appointed, not by the Crown, not by removable and responsible officers of the Crown but by the archbishop of Canterbury and bishop of London, who are neither removable nor responsible who are not lawyers who are not statesmen who ought to be no politicians who are, indeed, priests of the highest order, but not, on that account, the most proper persons to appoint judges of the highest order? So it is in the province of York, where the judges are appointed by the archbishop; so in all other Consistorial courts, where the judges are appointed by the bishops of the respective dioceses in which they are situated. From their courts an appeal lies, it is true, to the court of Delegates, in the last resort; but, so far from this affording an adequate remedy, it is an additional evil; for I will venture to affirm, that the Delegates is one of the worst constituted courts which was ever appointed, and that the course of its proceedings forms one of the greatest mockeries of appeal ever conceived by man. And I shall demonstrate this to you in a very few words. The Court is thus formed: You take three judges from the Common Law courts, one from each: to these you add some half dozen civil lawyers, advocates from Doctors' Commons, who the day before may have been practising in those courts, but who happen not to have been in the particular cause, in respect of which the appeal has been asserted. Now, only see what the consequence of this must be. The civilians, forming the majority of the Delegates, are, of necessity, men who have no practice, or the very youngest of the 154 doctors. So that you absolutely appeal from the three great judges of the Civil and Maritime courts from the sentences of sir William Scott, sir John Nicholl, and sir Christopher Robinson of those learned and experienced men, who are to us the great luminaries of the Civil law the venerated oracles best fitted to guide our path through all the difficulties of that branch of the science, and open to us its dark passages you appeal from them to judges, the majority of whom must, of necessity, be the advocates the least employed in the courts where those great authorities preside, the most recently admitted to those courts, and the most unqualified to pronounce soundly on their I proceedings, if it were decent that they should pronounce at all; for, out of so small a bar, the chances are, that the three or four eminent advocates have been employed in the case under appeal. Thus the absurdity is really much the same as if you were to appeal from a solemn and elaborate judgment, pronounced by my lord Tenterden, Mr. Justice Bayley, Mr.; Justice Holroyd, and Mr. Justice Little-dale, to the judgment of three young barristers, called but the day before, and three older ones, who never could obtain any practice. Sir, I have spoken of the primate and his principal suffragan; and I hope I need not protest, especially while I have the pleasure of addressing you, that what I have said of the privilege belonging to the highest dignitary in the Church, my observations were meant to be most remote indeed from every thing like personal disrespect; towards no persons in their exalted station do I bear a more profound respect than to both the distinguished prelates I have named, well knowing the liberality of their conduct in exercising the powers I am objecting to, as all the country knows the extent of learning and integrity of character which have made them the ornaments of our hierarchy. iv. I next come to speak of the Privy Council; a very important judicature, and of which the members discharge as momentous duties as any of the judges of this country, having to determine not only upon questions of Colonial Law in Plantation cases, but to sit also as judges, in the last resort, of all Prize causes. The point, however, to which I more immediately address myself on this head is, that they hear and decide upon all our Plantation  155 appeals. They are thus made the supreme judges, in the last resort, over every one of our foreign settlements, whether situated in those immense territories which you possess in the East; where you and a trading company together rule over not less than Seventy millions of subjects; or are established among those rich and populous islands which stud the Indian Ocean, and form the great Eastern Archipelago; or have their stations in those lands, part lying within the Tropics; part stretching towards the Pole, peopled by various castes differing widely in habits, still more widely in privileges; great in numbers, abounding in wealth, extremely unsettled in their notions of right, and excessively litigious, as all the children of the New World are supposed to be, both from their physical and political constitution. All this immense jurisdiction over the rights of property and person, over rights political and legal; and all the questions growing out of such a vast and varied province, is exercised by the privy council unaided and alone. It is obvious that, from the mere distance of those colonies, and the immense variety of matters arising in them, foreign to our habits, and beyond the scope of our knowledge, any judicial tribunal in this country must, of necessity, be an extremely inadequate court of review. But what adds incredibly to the difficulty is, that hardly any two of the colonies can be named which have the same law; and in the greater number the law is wholly unlike our own. In some Settlements, it is the Dutch law; in others the Spanish, in others the French, in others the Danish. In out Eastern possessions these variations are, if possible, yet greater: while one territory is swayed by the Mohammedan law, another is ruled by the native or Hindu law, and this again, in some of our possessions, is qualified or superseded by the law of Budda, the English jurisprudence being Confined to the handful of British settlers, and the inhabitants of the three presidencies. All these laws must come, in their turns, in review, before the necessarily ignorant privy councillor, after the learned doctors in each have differed. The difficulty thus Arising of necessity from our distance, an unavoidable incident to our colonial empire, may almost be deemed an incapacity, for it involves both ignorance of the law, and unfitness to judge of the facts. But so much the more anxious should we be to remove every unnecessary 156 obstacle to right judgment, and to use all the correctives in our power. The judges should be men of the largest legal and general information, accustomed to study other systems of law beside our own, and associated with lawyers who have practised and presided in the colonial courts. They should be assisted by a bar limiting its practice, for the most part, to this Appeal Court, at arty rate making it their principal object. To counteract, in some degree, the delays necessarily arising from the distance of the courts below, and give ample time for patient inquiry into so dark and difficult matters, the Court of Review should sit frequently and regularly at all seasons. Because all these precautions would still leave much to wish for, that is no kind of reason why you should not anxiously adopt them. On the contrary, it is your bounden duty, among those countless millions whom you desire to govern all over the globe, not to suffer a single Unnecessary addition to the inevitable impediments which the remote position of the seat of empire throws in the way of correct and speedy justice. Widely different are our arrangements. The privy council, which ought to be held more regularly than any other court, sits far less constantly than any, having neither a regular bench nor a regular bar. It only meets on certain extraordinary days the 30th of January, the Feast of the Purification, some day in May, Midsummer-day, and a few others. I find, on an average of twelve years, ending 1826, it sat in each year nine days, to dispose of all the appeals from all the British subjects in India; from our own civil courts, to the jurisdiction of which all our subjects are locally amenable, throughout the wide extent of the several presidencies of Calcutta, 'Bombay, and Madras; to dispose of all the causes which come up from the three several native courts of last resort, the Sudder Adawluts, from the two inferior courts of Zilla and Circuit, comprising all contested suits between the Hindoos, the half-caste people, and the Mahomedan inhabitants. But in the same nine days are to be disposed of, all the appeals from Ceylon, the Mauritius, the Cape, and New Holland; from our colonies in the West Indies and in North America; from our settlements in the Mediterranean, and from the islands in the Channel; nine days sittings are deemed sufficient for the decision of the whole. But nine days do  157 not suffice, nor any thing like it, for this purpose; and the summary I have in my hand demonstrates it both by what it contains, and by what it does not. It appears that, in all those twelve years taken together, the appeals have amounted to but few in number. I marvel that they are so few and yet I marvel not; for, in point of fact, you have no adequate tribunal to dispose of them; and the want of such a tribunal is an absolute denial of justice to the native subjects of the Crown in those colonies. The total number is only 467; but, Including about 50, which came from India, and appear not to have been regularly entered, though they are still undisposed of, there are 517. Of these 243 only have been disposed of; but only 129 have been heard, for the others were either compromised from hopelessness owing to the delay which had intervened between the appeal and the sentence, or dismissed for want of prosecution. Consequently, the privy council must have heard ten or eleven appeals only per year, or little more than one in the course of each day's sitting. Again, of the 129 which were heard and disposed of, no less than 56 were decided against the original sentences, being altered, but, generally speaking, wholly reversed. Now, 56 out of 129 is a very large proportion, little less than one half; and clearly shows that the limited number of appeals must have risen, not from the want of cases where revision was required, but from the apprehension of finding no adequate court of review, or no convenient despatch of business. And that the sentences in the colonies should oftentimes be found ill-digested, or hasty, or ignorant, can be no matter of astonishment, when we find a bold lieutenant-general Lord Chancellor in one court, and an enterprising captain president in another; and a worthy major officiating as judge-advocate in a third. In many of these cases, a learned and gallant Lord Chancellor has decided, in the court below, points of the greatest legal nicety; and the Judges of Appeal, who are to set him right here, are chosen without much more regard to legal aptitude; for you are not to suppose that the business of these nine days upon which they sit is all transacted before lawyers: one lawyer there may be, but the rest are laymen. Certainly a right honourable gentleman whom I see opposite to me is there sometimes by chance, and his presence is sure to be attended with 158 great advantage to us. Occasionally we see him or my learned friend, his predecessor (Mr. Abercromby), but this good fortune is rare; the Master of the Rolls alone is always to be seen there, of the lawyers; for the rest, one meets sometimes in company with him, an elderly and most respectable gentleman, who has formerly been an ambassador, and was a governor with much credit to himself in difficult times; and now and then a junior Lord of the Admiralty, who has been neither ambassador nor lawyer, but would be exceedingly fit for both functions, only that he happened to be educated for neither. And such, Sir, is the constitution of that awful Privy Council which sits at Westminster, making up, for its distance from the suitors, by the regularity of its sittings, and for its ignorance of local laws and usages, by the extent and variety of its general law learning; this is the court which determines, without appeal, and in a manner the most summary that can be conceived in this country, all those Most important matters which come before it. For instance, I once saw property worth thirty thousand pounds sterling per annum, disposed of in a few minutes, after the arguments at the bar ended, by the learned members of the Privy Council, who reversed a sentence pronounced by all the judges in the settlement, upon no less than nineteen days most anxious discussion. Such court, whose decisions are without appeal, irreversible, unless by act of parliament is the supreme tribunal which dispenses the law to eighty millions of people, and disposes of their property. I cannot pass from this subject without relating a fact which illustrates the consequences of the delays necessarily incident to such a jurisdiction. The Ranee, or queen of Ramnad, having died, a question arose among the members of her family, respecting the succession to the vacant musnud (or throne), and to the personal property of the deceased sovereign, as well as the territorial revenue. The situation of the country, as well as its population and wealth, render it a province of some note. It reckons four hundred thousand inhabitants, and it lies in the direct road which the pilgrims from the south of India take to the sanctuary in the island of Remisram, frequented by them as much as the Juggernaut is by those of the north. On the death of her highness in 1809, proceedings commenced  159 in the courts below, upon the disputed succession; an appeal to the king in counsel was lodged in 1814; it is still pending. And what has been the consequence of this delay of justice? Why, that the kingdom of Ramnad has been all this time in the keeping of sheriffs' officers, excepting the honourable company's peshcush, or share of the revenues, which, I have no manner of doubt, has been faithfully exacted to the last rupee. It is strictly in what amounts to the same thing as the custody of sheriffs' officers, having been taken, as I may say, in execution; or rather by a kind of mesne process, such as we have not in our law. As the papers on the table, to which I have referred, show so much fewer appeals from the plantations than might have been expected, it is fit now to remind the House how equivocal a symptom this is of full justice being done. It is the worst of all follies, the most iniquitous, as well as the most mistaken, kind of policy, to stop litigation not by affording a cheap and expeditious remedy, but by an absolute denial of justice, in the difficulties which distance, ignorance, expense, and delay produce. The distance you cannot remove, if you would; the ignorance it is hardly more practicable to get rid of: then, for God's sake, why not give to these your foreign subjects, what you have it in your power to bestow a speedy and cheap administration of justice? This improvement in the court of appeal would create more business, indeed, but justice would no longer be taxed and delayed, and in the cost and the delay be denied. But if you would safely, and without working injustice, stop appeals from the colonies, carry your reforms thither also: I should say, for instance, that a reform of the judicatures of India would be matter most highly deserving the consideration of his majesty's government. I am at a loss to know, why there should be so rigorous an exclusion of jury trials from the native courts of India. I know, and every one must know, who has taken the trouble to inquire, that the natives are eminently capable of applying their minds to the evisceration of truth in judicial inquiries; that they possess powers; of discrimination, ready ingenuity, and sagacity in a very high degree; and that where they have been admitted so to exercise those powers, they have been found most careful and intelligent assistants in aiding the investigations of the judge. 160 But I know also that your present mode of administering justice to these native subjects, is such as I can hardly speak of without shame. Look at your local judges at their fitness for judicial functions. A young writer goes out to India; he is appointed a judge, and he repairs to his station, to make money, by distributing justice, if he can, but, at all events, to make money. In total ignorance of the manners, the customs, the prejudices, possibly of the language, of those upon whose affairs and conduct he is to sit in judgment, and by whose testimony he is to pursue his inquiries, and very possibly equally uninformed of the laws he is to administer he must needs be wholly dependent upon his Pundit for direction both as to matter of fact and matter of law, and, most probably, becomes a blind passive tool in the hands of a designing minister. The House will not suppose that I mean to insinuate for a moment the possibility of suspicion as to the wilful misconduct of the judge in this difficult position. I am very sure that the party who may happen to occupy that high office would rather cut off his right hand, if the alternative were put to him, than take the bribe of a paria to misdecide a cause that came before him. But I am by no means so secure of the Pundit upon whom the judge must necessarily be dependent; and while he is both less trust-worthy and wholly irresponsible, the purity of the responsible, but passive, instrument in his hands is a thing of perfect insignificance. The experiment of trial by jury, by which this serious evil may in part be remedied, has been already tried. The efforts made by a learned judge of Ceylon, sir Alexander Johnson, to introduce into that colony the British system of justice, manfully supported by the government at home, have been attended with signal success. I am acquainted with a particular case, indeed, the details of which are too long to lay before the House, but which showed the fitness of the natives to form part of a tribunal, notwithstanding the prevalence of strong prejudices in a particular instance among them. A Bramin was put on his trial for murder, and a great feeling excited against him, possibly against his caste. Twelve of the jury were led away by this feeling, and by the very strong case which a subtle conspiracy had contrived against the prisoner, when a young  161 Bramin, the thirteenth juror, examined the evidence with a dexterity and judgment that excited the greatest admiration, and from his knowledge of the habits and manners of the witnesses, together with extraordinary natural sagacity, succeeded in exposing the plot and saving the innocent man. Other considerations there are, less immediately connected with the administration of justice, and which I might press upon the House, to evince the expediency of introducing our system of trial in the East. Nothing could be better calculated to conciliate the minds of the natives than allowing them to form part of the tribunals to which they are subject, and share in administering the laws under which they live. It would give them an understanding of the course of public justice, and of the law by which they are ruled; a fellow feeling with the government which executes it, and an interest in supporting the system in whose powers they participate. The effect of such a proceeding would be, that, in India, as in Ceylon, in the event of a rebellion, the great mass of the people, instead of joining the revolters, would give all their support to the government. This valuable, but not costly fruit of the wise policy pursued in that island, has already been gathered. In 1816, the same people which, twelve years before, had risen against your dynasty, were found marshalled on your side, and helping you to crush rebellion. So will it be in the Peninsula, if you give your subjects a share in administering your laws, and an interest and a pride in supporting you. Should the day ever come when disaffection may appeal to seventy millions, against a few thousand strangers, who have planted themselves upon the ruins of their ancient dynasties, you will find how much safer it is to have won their hearts, and universally cemented their attachment by a common interest in your system, than to rely upon one hundred and fifty thousand Seapoy swords, of excellent temper, but in doubtful hands. v. I now, Sir, come to the administration of law in the country, by Justices of Peace; and I approach this jurisdiction with fear and trembling, when I reflect on what Mr. Windham was accustomed to say, that he dreaded to talk of, the game-laws in a House composed of sportsmen; and so, too, I dread, to talk of the Quorum in an assembly of magistrates. Surrounded as I am with my Honourable Friends, and 162 among Honourable Members on the other side, by gentlemen in the commission, I own that this is a ground on which I have some reluctance to tread. But I have to deal with the principle only, not with the individuals: my reflections are general, not personal. Nevertheless, considering the changes which have been effected in modern times, I cannot help thinking it worth inquiry, whether some amendment might not be made in our justice of peace system? The first doubt which strikes me is, if it be fit that they should be appointed as they are, merely by the Lords Lieutenant of counties, without the interference of the Crown's responsible ministers. It is true, that the Lord Chancellor issues the commission, but it is the Lord Lieutenant who designates the persons to be comprehended in it. Such a thing is hardly ever known as any interference with respect to those individuals on the part of the Lord Chancellor. He looks to the Lord Lieutenant, or rather to the 'Custos Rotulorum,' which the Lord Lieutenant most frequently is (indeed everywhere but in counties Palatine), for the names of proper persons. The Lord Lieutenant, therefore, as Custos Rotulorum, absolutely appoints all the justices of the peace in his county, at his sole will and pleasure. Now I cannot understand what quality is peculiar to a Keeper of the Records, that fits him, above all other men, to say who shall be the judges of the district whose records he keeps. I think it would be about as convenient and natural to let the Master of the Rolls appoint the judges of the land; indeed, more so, for he is a lawyer; or to give the appointment to the Keeper of the State Papers. The Custos Rotulorum may issue a new commission, too, and leave out names; I have known it done, but I have also known it prevented by the Great Seal; indeed, it laid down as a rule by the late Lord Chancellor Eldon, from which no consideration, his Lordship was used to say, should induce him to depart, that however unfit a magistrate might be for his office, either from private misconduct or party feeling, he would never strike that magistrate off the list, until he had been convicted of some offence by the verdict of a Court of Record. Upon this principle he always acted. No doubt his Lordship felt, that, as the Magistrates gave their services gratis, they ought to be protected; but still it is a rule which opens the door to very serious mis-  163 chief and injustice; and I myself could, if necessary, quote cases in which it has been most unfortunately persevered in. On looking, however, at the description of persons who are put into the commission, I am not at all satisfied that the choice is made with competent discretion; and upon this part of the question I may as well declare at once, that I have very great doubts as to the expediency of making Clergymen magistrates. This is a course which, whenever it can be done conveniently, I should certainly be glad to see changed, unless in counties where there are very few resident lay proprietors. My opinion is, that a clerical magistrate, in uniting two very excellent and useful characters, pretty commonly spoils both; and the combination produces what the alchemists call a tertium quid, with very little, indeed, of the good qualities of either ingredient, and no little of the bad ones of both, together with new evils superinduced by the commixture. There is the activity of the magistrate in an excessive degree over-activity is a very high magisterial offence, in my view yet most of the magistrates distinguished for over-activity are clergymen: joined to this are found the local Ratings and likings, and, generally, somewhat narrow-minded opinions and prejudices, which are apt to attach to the character of the resident parish priest, one of the most valuable and respectable if kept pure from political contamination. There are some Lords Lieutenant, I know, who make it a rule never to appoint a clergyman to the magistracy; and I entirely agree in the policy of that course, because the education and the habits of such gentlemen are seldom of a worldly description, and therefore by no means qualify them to discharge the duties of such an office; but, generally speaking, as the House must be aware, through the country the practice is far otherwise. Again, some Lords Lieutenant appoint men for their political opinions some for activity as partisans in local contests; some are so far influenced as to keep out all who take a decided part against themselves in matters where all men should be free to act as their opinions dictate; and in the exercise of this patronage no responsibility whatever substantially exists. Appointed, then, by irresponsible advisers, and irremovable without a conviction, let us now see what is the authority of men so chosen and so secure. 164 In the first place, they have the privilege of granting or withholding Licences. As we all know, it lies in the breast of two justices of the peace to give or to refuse this important privilege. It is in their absolute power to give a licence to one of the most unfit persons possible; and it is in their power to refuse a licence to one of the most fit persons possible. They may continue a licence to some person who has had it but a twelvemonth, and who, during that twelvemonth, has made his house a nuisance to the whole neighbourhood; or they may take away a licence from a house to which it has been attached for a century, and the enjoyment of which has not only been attended by no evil, but has been productive of great public benefit. And all this, be it observed, they do without even the shadow of control. There is no rule more certain than that a mandamus does not lie to compel justices either to grant or withhold a licence. I hardly ever remember moving for one; and I only once recollect a rule being granted it was on the motion of, I believe, my honourable and learned friend, the solicitor-general. But I know that great astonishment was expressed on the occasion; that every one asked what he could have stated to make the Court listen to the application; that all took for granted it would be discharged, as a matter of course; which it accordingly was, in less time than I have taken to relate the circumstance. What other control is there over the conduct of the licensing magistrate? I shall be told that he may be proceeded against, either by a criminal information, or by impeachment. As to the latter, no man of common sense would dream of impeaching a magistrate, any more than he would think now-a-days of impeaching a minister. Then, as to proceeding by criminal information: In the first place it is necessary in order to obtain the rule, to produce affidavits, that the magistrate has been influenced by wilful and corrupt motives: not merely affidavits of belief in those who swear, but of facts proving him guilty of malversation in his office. Then, suppose, as not unfrequently happens, a rule obtained on this ex parte statement; the magistrate answers the charges on oath; he swears last, and may touch many points never anticipated by the other party, consequently not answered; and unless the alleged facts remain, upon the discussion, undeniable, and the guilt to be inferred from them  165 seems as clear as the light of day, the rule is discharged with costs. The difficulty of proving corruption is rendered almost insuperable, because all the magistrate has to do, in order to defend himself from the consequences of granting or withholding a licence, is to adopt the short course of saying nothing at the time of keeping his own counsel of abstaining from any statement of his reasons. Let him only give no reason for his conduct, and no power on earth can touch him. He may grant a licence to a common brothel, or he may refuse a licence to one of the most respectable inns on the North road; let him withhold his reasons, and his conduct remains unquestionable; although the real motive by which he is actuated may be, that he is in the habit of using the one house, and that the landlord of the other will not suffer him to use it in the same way. Unless you can show that he has himself stated his motives, or that there are circumstances so strong against him as amount to conviction, you are prevented from even instituting an inquiry on the subject. Thus absolute is the authority of the magistrate with regard to licensing. With the permission of the House, in order to illustrate the abuse of this extensive power, I will read a letter which I received some time ago on the subject of the licensing system, from one of the most worthy and learned individuals in this country a man of large fortune, and of most pure and estimable character who long acted as a magistrate in one of the neighbouring counties. [Mr. B. here read a letter, in which the tendency of justices is stated to favour particular houses, and not take away their licences, though guilty of the grossest irregularities, on the pretence, become a maxim with many of them, that ""the house being brick and mortar cannot offend;"" whereas a haunt of bad company being established, it becomes the magistrate's duty to break it up. It was also shown how the power of licensing placed millions of property at the disposal of the justices, a licence easily adding 500l. to the value of a lease, and often much more, and the number of victuallers exceeding forty thousand. It further showed the partiality of the bench towards brewers and their houses, especially in Middlesex and the home counties.] I have received a variety of other information upon this subject, all leading to the 166 same result. That which I have described the leaning of justices towards brewers, whom, in licensing, they favour, as brother magistrates, although the latter are not allowed by law to preside at a Brewster sessions, is, perhaps, the most crying evil connected with the system; but who does not know (I am sure I do, in more parts of the kingdom than one or two), that licences are granted, and refused, from election motives? When, some time ago, I brought the Beer bill into this House, I had, of course, an extensive correspondence on the subject; and I was assured by many highly respectable persons, that the evil of this system is by no means confined to the neighbourhood of London, of which they gave me numerous instances. Nor is the licensing power of the magistracy that in which alone great abuses exist. They prevail wheresoever their authority is exercised; in the commitments for offences against the game-laws, in dealing with petty offences against property, in taking cognizance of little assaults, especially on officers, in summary convictions for nonpayment of tithes, and a number of other matters affecting the liberties and property of the subject; and yet, for their conduct in all of which they are not amenable to any superior power, provided, as I have said before, they only keep their own counsel, and abstain from stating the reasons by which they have been actuated, should their motives be evil. There is not a worse constituted tribunal on the face of the earth, not before the Turkish cadi, than that at which summary convictions on the game-laws take place; I mean a bench or a brace of sporting justices. I am far from saying that, on such subjects, they are actuated by corrupt motives; but they are undoubtedly instigated by their abhorrence of that caput lupinum that hostis humani generis, as an honourable friend of mine once called him in his place, that fera nature a poacher. From their decisions on those points, where their passions are the most likely to mislead them, no appeal in reality lies; for, unless they set out any matter illegal on the face of the conviction, you remove the record in vain. Equally supreme are they in cases where sitting in a body at quarter sessions, they decide upon the most important rights of liberty and property. Let it be remembered, that they can sentence to almost unlimited imprisonment, to whipping, to fine, nay, to transportation for  167 seven and fourteen years. I have shuddered to see the way in which these extensive powers are sometimes exercised by a jurisdiction not responsible for its acts. It is said, that the magistracy ought not to be responsible, because it is not paid; but we ought not to forget, that as gold itself may be bought too dear, so may economy; money may be saved at too high a price. Mark the difference of responsibility between the quarter-sessions and one of the superior courts of the kingdom. In the King's-bench, the name of the judge who pronounces the judgment is known, and the venerable magistrate stands before the country in his own proper person, always placed at the bar of public opinion. Here it is Lord Tenterden it is Mr. Justice Bailey, by their names: in the other case, it is merely the quarter-sessions, which, as Swift says, is nobody's name. The individual magistrates composing it are not thought of their names are not even published. It is a fluctuating body. If the same individuals always sat in the court, there might be some approach to responsibility. At present there is none; and where there is no responsibility, injustice will occasionally be committed, as long as men are men. It would be some correction of the evil, if the number of magistrates was fixed; if their names were always known in connexion with their acts; and if they were more easily removable on proof of their misconduct. Then comes the question, is it, after all, gratuitous service? We are told that we cannot visit them severely, or even watch them very strictly, because they volunteer their duty, and receive no remuneration for their trouble. But although they have no money for it, they may have money's worth. Cheap justice, Sir, is a very good thing; but costly justice is much better than cheap injustice. If I saw clearly the means by which the magistrates could be paid, and by which, therefore, a more correct discharge of the magisterial duties might be insured, I would certainly prefer paying them in money to allowing them to receive money's worth by jobs, and other violations of their duty. Not only may the magistrate himself receive compensation as money's worth; he may receive it in hard money by his servants. The fees of a justice's clerk amount to a little income, often to many times a man's wages. I have heard of a reverend justice in the country having a clerk, whose emoluments he wished to in- 168 crease, and therefore he had him appointed surveyor of weights and measures, with a salary of a guinea and a half a week. This person appointed a deputy, to whom he gave five shillings and sixpence, and who did all the duty. These circumstances came under the consideration of his brother justices; when, after a strenuous opposition, and among others, on the part of the gentleman who communicated the occurrence in a letter now lying before me, it was decided, not only not to remove the first appointed person, who it was proved was doing nothing, but to swear in the other as his assistant! My friend is not entirely without suspicion that this person, having so small a remuneration as five shillings and sixpence a week, can only have undertaken the duty with a view of increasing it by some understanding with the people whose weights and measures it is his duty to superintend. The operation of pecuniary motives in matters connected with the magistracy is more extensive than may at first sight appear. There was a bill introduced by the right honourable gentleman opposite, for extending the payment of expenses of witnesses and prosecutors out of the county rates. It is not to be doubted that it has greatly increased the number of commitments, and has been the cause of many persons being brought to trial who ought to have been discharged by the magistrates. The habit of committing, from this and other causes, has grievously increased every where of late, and especially of boys. Eighteen hundred odd, many of them mere children, have been committed in the Warwick district during the last seven years. Nor is this a trifling evil. People do not come out of gaol as they went in. A boy may enter the prison-gate merely as a robber of an orchard; he may come out of it ""fit for"" I will not say ""treasons"" but certainly ""stratagems and spoils."" Many are the inducements, independent of any legislative encouragement, to these commitments. The justice thinks he gains credit by them. He has the glory of being commemorated at the assizes before the Lord Judge, and the Sheriff, and the Grand Jury, and all who read the Crown Calendar. On that solemn occasion he has the gratification of hearing it fly from mouth to mouth ""He is a monstrous good magistrate; no man commits so many persons."" Then there is the lesser glory acquired among neighbours; I into whose pockets they are the means of  169 putting money, by making them prosecutors and witnesses in petty criminal cases; and thus converting (as sir Eardly Wilmot says) their journey of duty into a jaunt of pleasure to the assizes. The reputation of activity is very seducing to a magistrate; but I have known it curiously combined with things more solid than empty praise. In a certain town, which I am well acquainted with, one suburb was peopled by Irishmen and Scots, who were wont to fight on every market time a good deal, at fair tides a good deal more, but without any serious affray taking place. Besides these two classes of the King's subjects, there also dwelt in those parts two justices of the King, assigned to keep the peace; for the better keeping of which, they repaired at the hour of fight to an ale-house, conveniently situated hard by the scene of action, and there took their seat with a punch-bowl full of warrants, ready to fill up. If the Irish happened to be victorious, the Scots came one after another, and applied for commitments, against those who had assaulted them. The despatch, at least with which warrants, if not justice, were administered, was notable. Then came the other party, and swore to as many assaults upon them, and, justice being even-handed, they, too, had their desire gratified; until the bowl was, by degrees, emptied of its paper investment, and a metallic currency, by degrees, took its place. Some of these details may be ludicrous; but the general subject is a most serious and a most important one, because these facts show the manner in which justice is administered to the people out of sight of the public and out of reach of the higher courts of law. It is through the magistracy, more than through any other agency except, indeed, that of the tax-gatherer that the people are brought directly into contact with the government of the country; and this is the measure of justice with which, when they approach it, they are treated by functionaries irresponsible for its proceedings. A justice of the peace, whether in his own parlour or on the bench whether employed in summary convictions, or in enforcing what is called, after a very worthy friend of mine, Mr. Nicholson Calvert's Act (one of the worst in the Statute-book, which I hope to see repealed, and which I trust its excellent author will very long survive,) is never an ostensible individual; responsible in his own proper person, to public opinion hardly ever unless 170 he chooses, by some indiscretion, to make himself so, amenable to a higher and purer judicature. The judges of the land, chosen from the professors of the law, after the labours of a life previously devoted to the acquirement of knowledge calculated to fit them for their office, and clothed with attributes of supreme power over petty magistrates, are responsible for every word and act, and are subject to every species of revision and control. They were selected with the most anxious caution for every qualification of high character and of profound knowledge; and yet they are incapable of pronouncing a single decision, from which an appeal will not lie to some other tribunal immediately above them; while, from the decision of the country justices taken from the community at hazard, or recommended by the habits least calculated to make them just, subject to no personal responsibility, because beyond or below the superintendence of public opinion, and irremovable, unless by a verdict for some indictable offence from their decision there is no appeal; from their decision, although they have to deal with some of the most important interests in the country, there is no appeal, unless their misdeeds shall have been set forth in a case, submitted by their own free will, with their express permission, to the Court of King's Bench. These are the principal points to which, in the first division of my subject, I desire to call the attention of the House, as deserving your deliberate consideration, and as the materials of solemn inquiry. I could have wished to accomplish my object more briefly, but I found it impossible consistently with distinctness; I am not aware that I have made an unnecessary comment; and I must trust to the candour of honourable members, in weighing the importance of these statements, to pardon the apparent prolixity unavoidably incident to the handling of a very extensive and varied argument. II. I wish I could give the House any promise that my speech was approaching its termination; but that hope can hardly be entertained, when I state, that I am now about to enter on the still more vast I and momentous consideration of the laws as administered in those tribunals, whose construction we have been surveying the distribution of justice in those courts I in which it has been my fortune to practise during a pretty long professional life.  171 There is a consideration of a general nature, to which I would first of all advert, I mean, the inconvenient differences, in the tenures by which property is held, and the rules by which it is conveyed, and transmitted, in various districts of the country. Is it fitting or consistent with reason, or, indeed, with justice, that merely crossing the river, or travelling a distance of some miles in this neighbourhood, should make so great an alteration in the law of real property, as that, to the eastward of us, all the sons inherit equally; to the westward the youngest alone; and here the eldest; but these rules of the Common-law, of Gavelkind, and of Borough English are better known, and operate with more defined limits. What shall be said of the customary tenures, in a thousand manors, all different from the Common-law that regulates freehold estates, most of them differing from each other? Is it, I ask, fit that this multitude of laws, this variety of codes, the relics of a barbarous age, should be allowed to exist in a country subject to the same general bonds of government? I should trespass at greater length than I am willing to do, were I to detail the various customs which exist in the manors of this country; but to give the House an idea of their diversity, I must mention a few. In one manor, the copyhold property is not allowed to pass by will; in another, it may be so conveyed. I admit that a great improvement has been made in this respect, by the act of an hon. friend of mine, (Mr. M. A. Taylor) to whom we owe several other important legislative measures, allowing it to be devised by will without surrender. This is the only material improvement which has been made with respect to such property, within the last hundred years; but it only operates in facilitating the transmission, according to the custom of the manor, passing the copyhold by will. In one manor, a devise is not valid, if made longer than two years before the testator's decease; so that it is necessary for wills to be renewed every two years; in another one year, in a third three years are the period; while in many there are no such restrictions. In some manors the eldest daughter succeeds to the exclusion of her sisters, as the eldest daughter (in default of male heirs) succeeds to the crown of England; in other manors all the daughters succeed jointly as co-parceners, after the manner of the Common-law. In some 172 manors a wife has her dower, one-third of the tenement, as in case of freehold. In others, she has, for her ""free bench,"" one half; and again, in some, she takes the whole for life to the exclusion of the heir. The fines on death or alienation, vary; the power and manner of entailing or cutting off entails vary; the taking of heriots and lords' services varies. There are as many or more of these local laws than in France, in the Pays de Coutume, of which I have seen four hundred enumerated, so as to make it the chief opprobrium of the old French law, that it differed in every village. Is it right that such varieties of custom should be allowed to have force in particular districts, contrary to the general law of the land? Is it right, I may also ask, that in London, Bristol, and some other places, the debts due to a man should be subject to execution for what he owes himself, while in all the rest of England there is no such resource; although in Scotland, as in France, this most rational and equitable law is universal? All these local peculiarities augment the obstacles, both to the conveyance and to the improvement of landed estates. They prevent the circulation of property in a great degree, and they lessen the chance that an owner of such tenements would otherwise have of raising money, on their security, adequate to their value. The greater facility of conveyance is nothing set against the ignorance of local custom; and then copyhold property is not liable even for specialty debts, nor can it be extended by elegit; and thus, absurd and unjust as is the law which prevents freehold property from being charged with simple contract debts, it goes further in this instance, and exempts the copyhold from liability, even to those of the highest nature, a judgment itself not giving the creditor any right of execution against it. The obvious remedy to be adopted in this case is, to give all parts of the country the same rules touching property; and, therefore, I would propose an assimilation of the laws affecting real estates, all over England, to take place at a given period, say twenty or thirty years hence, so as to prevent interference with vested interests. Having now, Sir, pointed out some of the varieties of our law in certain districts, its inequalities in respect of place, let us proceed to examine whether it is more uniform and more equal in respect of persons. And here we are met, at the very  173 outset, with a most fearful exception to the maxim, which describes the law as no respecter of persons. It is commonly said, that the Crown and the subject come into court on equal terms. Lawyers of the present day do not, I am aware, profess this; but that great dealer in panegyric, Mr. Justice Blackstone, has spoken as if the King had no greater advantage in litigation than any of his people. It would have been well if he had stated that this was only a fiction; though he must have been puzzled to prove it, like other fictions, invented for the furtherance of justice. It is true that the law itself makes no such pretensions to impartiality; for of the two classes of manifest inequality which I am about to mention, one is avowedly such, by reason, as it is said, of the prerogative; although the other, just as substantial in reality, is not avowed to be so. I begin with the latter. It is said, that the Crown can no more take my estate than I can another man's; for if I have a claim against the Crown, it is said that I have a remedy, by the decent and respectful mode, as they term it, of a petition de droit, or, in case of a title by matter of record, a monstrans de droit. The same eloquent panegyrist, whom I have mentioned, describing the very name of the process to have arisen from the presumption of the law, that the King can do no wrong, adds, that, from the great excellence ascribed to the Crown, ""to know of an injury and to redress it, are one and the same thing therefore, the subject has only to make his grievance known by his petition."" From this is drawn the conclusion, that when a subject has a right, he can have the means of defending it with equal facility against the Crown as against any other party. Now, let us see how far this consequence is, in point of fact, realized. The Crown never moves by itself, but through the medium of the King's Attorney-general. No proceeding can be taken against the Crown without the fiat of the Attorney-general; and unless a party obtains that, all his trouble and expense in going to Whitehall, and asking the permission of the Secretary of State, is lost, because all such affairs are referred to the Crown lawyer; and if he should refuse leave, the only remedy left to the subject is the very convenient and practical one of impeaching that officer. It may be said that the Attorney-general would not refuse his fiat, because it is a mere proceeding in the first 174 instance, like suing out an original writ, or a latitat, to bring a cause into the King's-bench; and the Attorney-general here is like the Chancellor or the sealers of the writs elsewhere, who issue writs to any suitor as a matter of course. But I make answer that, although it ought to be so, it is not so. It is in the discretion of the Attorney-general, that is, of your adversary's counsel, to let you bring your action or not as he pleases. Why, I demand, should it be left in the breast of any man to refuse that which another may claim as a right, and as the lowest of all rights, to have his right inquired into by law? To show you how this discretionary power is used, I might say abused, I will mention a case; and, following the rule I prescribed to myself at setting out, it shall be one that has come within my own knowledge professionally. A considerable estate had, in a supposed default of heirs, been granted to a gentleman of great respectability, a friend of mine. After some time another individual set up a claim to it, on the ground of being the heir of the body of the original grantee, the first gift having been in tail male. The case was submitted to me and to a learned friend of mine at the Chancery bar; and we advised that the party should proceed by petition of right. We examined all the cases upon the subject, and deeming this the only mode, we applied to the Attorney-general, and he refused his fiat, giving no better reason than that we ought to have proceeded by ejectment against the; tenant in possession. We preferred our writ of right against the Crown, as all lawyers term the petition de droit. Had the question been with a subject, we might either have proceeded by ejectment to recover possession, or by writ to try the mere right as the higher remedy; and no officer could have shut us out at either door by which we chose to enter the court. Now, I can state conscientiously my opinion, that the case of the individual alluded to was a strong one in statement. It was one of pedigree, and certainly one of the clearest I had seen on paper. I do not mean to assert, for I had no means of ascertaining it, that it was unanswerable. There may have been some gap in the chain, some marriage, or some birth not proved, or some other flaw in the claimant's title; but of that I can form no judgment, because that I was not allowed to try; and this is the hardship of the case the matter of which, I hold, my  175 client had just reason to complain he was not allowed to bring forward his proofs. Then, I ask, is it not a mere mockery in those panegyrists of things as they are, to say that the Crown and the subject stand on equal footing? But the cases in which the same disparity prevails between their rights, avowedly and by the positive sanction of the law, are much more numerous; they are of constant occurrence, too, in practice, and I will, therefore, mention them for the information of those who are not lawyers, and, I believe I may say, of some who are. In the first place, it is the general principle that a demurrer is an admission of the fact in dispute; but this, it is said, does not extend to the Crown, and that, if defeated in this way, it can begin again, and is not concluded. Secondly, it has been decided lately in the Exchequer I was not in the case, but so I have heard, from those who attend that court, that no such thing is allowed as an exception for insufficiency to an answer filed by the Attorney-general on behalf of the Crown. But the subject notoriously enjoys no such privilege; his answer is open to all exceptions; were it not, you must, in suing him, take for an answer just what he chooses to tell you, and he escapes the equitable jurisdiction entirely. Next, (and an instance occurred lately, which I argued in the court of King's-bench, and which was decided against me, without hearing the other side,) wherever a suit is commenced, whether it be in Cumberland, Middlesex, or Cornwall, (and in Cornwall was the case I allude to,) if the Crown has any title which may, however indirectly, come in question, although no party, the proceedings can at once be removed by a mere suggestion, not of record, but on the part of the Attorney-general, stating it from his place in court, and a trial must then be had at bar before the four judges. In this way all the preparations made by the parties are put an end to, and witnesses must be brought to town at an inordinate expense, and under every disadvantage. There is no doubt that an allowance would, in such cases, be made by the Crown, to compensate for this additional cost; but still the party has to pay in the first instance, together with being taken away, as well as his witnesses, from that part of the country in which he and they are known, to the county of Middlesex, where the power of the Crown is more accurately 176 known than the character of the other suitor. When this point was argued, the Court held the prerogative too clear to be discussed. There is a fourth striking advantage which the Crown possesses over any other party. No person can, after the jury is sworn, withdraw a record, but must be non-suited, to avoid a verdict. The Crown has, to my knowledge, withdrawn it, after counsel had been heard, and witnesses examined, and the jury been charged by the judge; I have known the record withdrawn while they were deliberating, and because they were deliberating, which indicated hesitation; and this late retreat is made without the penalty to which any other party would be liable, who had fled before the cause was called on, namely, the costs of the day; for there is another unfairness to justify this course; that as the Crown is supposed above receiving costs, so it is to be exempt also from paying them. But the reason of this I cannot possibly see. I cannot grant that the dignity of the Crown places it above taking costs, when I reflect that by the Crown is here meant the revenue raised from the people for the public service, and that, consequently, the non-payment of costs to the Crown is an increase of the people's burthens. But, even if I could admit the propriety of the Crown's receiving none, it would by no means follow that it should pay none to the subject, who is in a widely different predicament. All this, however, arises out of notions derived from the feudal times, when the Crown was in a situation the very reverse of that in which it stands at present, its income then arising almost entirely from a land revenue. There is now no reason why it should be exempt from paying, or disabled from receiving, in all cases where costs would be due between common persons. Indeed, there has been of late years an exception made in the Crown law on this head, but so as to augment the inequality I complain of. In all Stamp prosecutions, the costs of the Crown are paid by the unsuccessful defendant; so far does it stoop from its former dignity; but not so low as to pay the defendant a farthing of his costs should he be acquitted. The last and the worst part of the history remains; whenever a special jury is summoned in a Crown case, and that all the twelve jurors do not attend, a tales cannot be prayed to let the cause proceed, without a warrant from the  177 Attorney-general: so that it is in the power of your adversary to refuse this at the time it may be most for his advantage so to do; while you have no option whatever in case it should be for his interest to proceed, and for your's to delay. I pray the House will mark attentively what I am now about to relate, although, indeed, I should apologise for thus appealing to them, after the singular patience with which I have been heard throughout, for the great length of time I have already occupied. There was a case in the Court of Exchequer, in which I acted as counsel for the defendant, and had to subject a Crown witness to a severe cross-examination; he exhibited strong indications of perjury, but the verdict went against me notwithstanding. My learned friend, Mr. Serjeant Jones, (whose talent and professional skill entitle him to higher praise than any in my power to bestow,) whether he profited by my experience, or was more dexterous in dealing with the case, did honour to himself by succeeding in the next trial, when the same witness was examined; for the suspicion of perjury entertained before was now turned into certainty, and the party acquitted. A prosecution for perjury was instituted against that man and others connected with him; eighteen indictments were found at the sessions, and the Crown at once removed the whole by certiorari into the Court of King's-bench. There they were all to be tried, and a former Attorney-general conducted the prosecution. On the first, Meade, the witness I have mentioned, was clearly convicted. The other seventeen were then to have been tried, and Mr. Serjeant Jones called them on, but the Crown had made the whole eighteen Special Jury causes: a sufficient number of jurymen did not attend; my learned friend wanted to pray a tales, and the Crown refused a warrant. Thus an expense of ten thousand pounds was incurred, and a hundred witnesses from Yorkshire were brought to London, all for nothing, except, after the vexation, trouble and delay he had endured, to work the ruin of the prosecutor, who had been first harassed upon the testimony of the perjured witness. These poor Yorkshire farmers, whom this villain had so vexed, had no more money to spend in law; all the other prosecutions dropped; Meade obtained a rule for a new trial, but funds were wanting to meet him again, and he 178 escaped. So that public justice was utterly frustrated, as well as the most grievous wrong inflicted upon individuals. Nor did it end here; the poor farmer was fated to lose his life by the transaction. Meade, the false witness, and Law, the farmer whom he had informed against, and who was become the witness against him, lived in the same village; and one evening, in consequence, as was alleged, of some song or madrigal sung by him in the street, this man Meade seized a gun, and shot Law from his house dead upon the spot. He was acquitted of the murder, on the ground of something like provocation, but he was found guilty of manslaughter, and such was the impression of his guilt upon the mind of the court, that he was sentenced to two years imprisonment. A case of more complicated injustice one fraught with more cruel injustice to the parties, I never knew in this country, nor do I conceive that worse can be found in any other. We may talk of our excellent institutions, and excellent they certainly are, though I could wish we were not given to so much Pharasaical praising of them; but if, while others, who do more and talk less, go on improving their laws, we stand still, and suffer all our worst abuses to continue, we shall soon cease to be respected by our neighbours, or to receive any praises save those we are so ready to lavish upon ourselves. i. And now, having thus far cleared the way for examining the proceedings in our courts of justice, the first inquiry that meets us is, by what means unnecessary litigation may be prevented; in other words, suits unjustly and frivolously brought, and wrongfully defended, by oppressive or intemperate parties. I shall here, as under all the other heads of the subject, begin by laying down what I take to be the sound principles of legislation applicable to the point, and then comparing with these the provisions actually adopted by our jurisprudence. The first and most obvious step is, to remove the encouragement given to rich and litigious suitors, by lessening the expense of all legal proceedings; and I would put an end to all harassing and unjust, defences, by encouraging expedition. Next, I would not allow of any action or proceeding which only profits the court and the practitioners, and the object of which is always granted as a mere matter of course; all things should be considered as  179 done at once and for nothing, which may now be done on a simple application to the Court with some delay and expense. Thirdly, no party should be sent to two courts where one is able to afford him his whole remedy; nor to a dear and bad court, when he can elsewhere have a cheaper and a better remedy; nor should any one be obliged to come twice over to the same court for different portions of his remedy, which he might have all in one proceeding. Fourthly, whenever a strong presumption of right appears on the part of a plaintiff, the burthen of disputing his claim should be thrown on the defendant. This I would extend to such cases as bills of exchange, bonds, mortgages, and other such securities. In those cases I think the plaintiff should be allowed to have his judgment, upon due notice given, unless good cause be, in the first instance, shown to the contrary, and security given to prosecute a suit for setting the instrument aside. This is a mode well known in the law of Scotland, and would put an end to all those undefended causes, which are now attended with such great and useless expense, as well as injurious delay to the parties. Fifthly, I would suggest, that in all cases where future suits are to be apprehended, proceeding might be adopted immediately to raise the question, and quiet the title. The law on this head also is very different in the two parts of the island. In England, it is not possible to have the opinion of any Court, until the parties are actually engaged in a lawsuit, opportunities for which may very frequently not occur, until the witnesses to prove a case may be dead, or an infant, or a person living abroad, and incapable of well defending his right, has come into possession. But the Scotch law furnishes a kind of action, the adoption of which may be productive of the greatest benefit, as I have once and again heard lord Eldon hint in the House of Lords. I know very well that here we may file a bill for perpetuating testimony, but there must be an actual vested right in the party instituting the suit: and the proceeding is, besides, so cumbrous, as rarely to be used. The Scotch law, on the contrary, permits a declaratory action to be instituted by the party in possession or expectancy, quia timet, and enables him to make all whose claims he dreads parties, so as to obtain a decision of the question immediately. This is, of course, and very pro- 180 perly, at the expense of him who brings forward the suit for his own interest, unless where a very obvious benefit arises to the other party; for in Scotland they have nothing like our statute of Gloucester, and costs are always in the discretion of the Court, as with us in equity. Sixthly, I would abolish all obsolete proceedings, which serve only as a trap to the unwary, or tools in the hands of litigious and dishonest parties, and lie hid or unheeded until, unexpectedly, they are brought forth to work injustice. For an instance, I will name wager of law, a defence which may be set up in answer to an action of detinue, or of debt on simple contract. This is another of the remains of the old feudal system. The defendant has only to swear that he does not owe the sum of money claimed by the plaintiff, and bring eleven others to swear that they believe him; and a defendant would certainly be badly off if he could not find out so many persons to do this kind office for him, as he needs only bring those who know him, but know nothing at all of the circumstances; for the less they know, the more ready will they be to swear they believe their friend. He has only to place them on opposite sides, at the end of the table, (for the wisdom of past ages hath carefully fixed the stations which the parties are to occupy pending this solemnity,) get them to swear, and there is an end at once of the action. It is true that pleas of this kind are seldom pleaded, though it was done some time ago in the Common Pleas: and the oldest practitioners there, not being acquainted with the plea, were about demurring to it, when it was discovered to be a law wager well pleaded, and a complete good defence in law, though the practice was obsolete. Now, these being the fundamental principles that should guide us on this head, nothing can depart more widely from them than our practice, and nothing can be more easy than making it conform to them. In the first place, without throwing away a thought upon the pain which I should necessarily inflict upon some of my learned friends, much wedded to such lore without caring a rush for the quantity of curious learning which would thus be thrown to waste or dropping a tear over the musty records which must be swept away I would abolish at once the whole doctrine and procedure of Fines and Recoveries. I hope I may not offend the ears  181 of my respected brethren the conveyancers; but I may say, that if ever there was an absurdity not to be tolerated, it is those fictitious suits at any time, but above all, in the present state of society. I wish to make myself understood, for I see by the countenances of some gentlemen, that they do not quite comprehend the whole absurdity of the law respecting fines and recoveries. I do not by any means wish to interfere with the power of making, or of barring entails: I consider the English law as hitting very happily the just medium between too great strictness and too great latitude, in the disposition of landed property; sufficient restraints upon perpetuities, upon endless settlements, are provided, to allow a free commerce in land, as far as that is consistent with the interests of agriculture, and the exigencies of our mixed constitution; while as much power is given of annexing estates to families, as may prevent a minute division of property, and preserve the aristocratic branch of the government. With the substance of our law of entail, then, I have no wish to meddle; all I desire is, to abolish the ridiculous machinery by which fines are levied and recoveries suffered. Every gentleman knows, that if he has an estate in fee he can sell it, or bestow it in any way he may please; but if he has an estate tail, to which he succeeds in the long vacation, he can go, on the first day of Michaelmas term, and levy a fine, which destroys the expectant rights of the issue in tail; or he may, by means of a recovery, get rid of those rights and all remainders over. He can thus, by going through certain mere forms, make himself absolute master of his estate, and do with it as he pleases. But this must be done through the Court of Common Pleas, at certain seasons of the year. And why should there exist a necessity for going there? Why not, if it be necessary, pay the fines which are due, without going there at all? I, the other day, asked this question of some learned friends, why force tenants in tail into court, for mere form sake? They laughed at my simplicity, and said, ""All this was asked a hundred years ago; there is no necessity for the proceeding, only to keep up the payment of the King's silver, alienation fines, and other duties."" In case of bankruptcy, the necessity for those forms is not felt. A trader who is tenant in tail commits an act of bankruptcy, and 182 by the assignment under the commission not only the interest vested in him is conveyed, but all remainders expectant upon it are destroyed, for the benefit of his creditors, and the estate passes to his assignees free from all restriction. The courts have held, as indeed the Bankrupt Laws evidently intended,* the conveyance in bankruptcy to be a statutary barring of I the entail an enlarger of the estate tail I to a fee. Now, I would do that for honest landowners, which the law at present permits to be done for tradesmen and their creditors. So, too, a man and his wife cannot convey an estate of the wife without a fine or a recovery, neither can the wife be barred of her dower without a similar proceeding. The reason is, the influence her husband may possess over her mind; and, consequently, a judge takes the woman, in these cases, into a private room, to examine her, first, as to whether she acts from fear, and then, when that is out of the case, whether she is influenced by favour and affection; and he also examines her, as to any temporary increase of affection from any passing cause; and then, when she has purged herself of all increase of affection from any passing cause, of all fear, and all love, she is allowed to give her consent. Now I would propose, in place of all this inquiry, not always very delicate, nor even very satisfactory, to let husband and wife join in common conveyance, with the consent of a guardian, to be appointed, or of the next male relative of the wife, who is not related to the husband, and not interested in either the succession or the conveyance. Now there is certainly nothing very real in a Fine; but as to Recoveries, I ask, do those persons who seem to hold by them, know at all what they avowedly proceed upon? They go upon the ground of compensation in value being made to the remainder man, whose right they cut off, and who, but for this fictitious suit, would have a title to take the estate after the * Of the bar to remainders in tail there can be no doubt; but there are decisions which lean against, the operation of the Bankruptcy, to bar the remainders over, contrary to Blackstone's decided opinion, (2 Com. 286. 361.) and it should seem to the plain intent of the legislature. See Doe v. Clarke, 5 B. A. 458, and Doe v. Tayleure, 3 B, A. 557.  183 tenant-in, tail's-decease. He is said to recover a compensation in value; and from whom does he get it? Why, the common vouchee, who is the crier of the Court of Common Pleas, and who, like the man at the Custom-house, obliged to take all the oaths other people do not like, lies groaning under the weight of all the liabilities he has incurred to every remainder man, since he became crier, and answerable for the millions of property in remainder, the rights to which have been barred, he not being worth a shilling. Locke says, that a madman is one who reasons rightly from wrong premises; so it is with the lawyers on recoveries, who argue very ingeniously, and even soundly and consistently, on the principle of the compensation, and whose conclusions could in no wise be impeached, if you once allowed the fact, that those in the remainder are compensated by the proceedings. Indeed, it happened to myself, not long ago, in a case, where a very large estate was in question, to argue, and to prevail, respecting the effect of a recovery, on this very ground of compensation in value. I there had to contend, that the claimant was barred by the recovery, in consequence of the compensation received from the vouchee, though it was quite certain that, from the vouchee, there never was, nor ever could be, received a single shilling. My argument, on that occasion, did not excite a smile in the court, because the principles of the law were known to be thus established, and the consequences were of serious import, be the premises ever so ludicrous. But, were I to use the same argument elsewhere, it would, if understood, be received with much less gravity. Put an end, then, to all such ridiculous forms, which have no earthly use but to raise a little money by way of fees; and which, beside creating expense and delay, and oftentimes preventing tenants in tail from passing their property by will, which they cannot if they die before suffering the recovery, give rise to a number of questions in law, often very puzzling, always dilatory and costly not rarely to mistakes in fact; as where I knew an estate go to the tenant in tail in remainder, instead of the recoveree's heir-at-law or devisee, which he fully intended it should, merely because in suffering the recovery an omission was made of one parcel. Sir, I also, would put an end to those 184 imaginary trusts made in settlements for the purpose of preserving contingent remainders. It has been said, that some Members of this House, who, during the Commonwealth, retired to the country and employed themselves in conveyancing, invented those refinements which characterize what are called strict settlements. I repeat, that my object is not to touch the principle of the law of entails, as it now exists in this country; believing that owners of estates should not be laid under greater restrictions than they now are in disposing of them by will after their death, or by settlement upon marriages in their families. But let the purpose of the owner be accomplished more simply and more easily than can now be done. I would allow every man to settle or to devise his property to A during his life, and after him to B and C in succession, making by plain words so many life estates, and giving a fee to the person who, by our present law, takes the first estate tail, not allowing him to have any power over the property until it became vested in possession, but requiring that, in order to affect it while in expectancy, he and the tenant for life should join in some simple conveyance, as a feoffment, where-by the settlement might be carried on. The property then would not be alienable an hour sooner than it now is, and it would be alienable without fine or recovery; and I would make the act, which the law now deems a discontinuance, as a feoffment in fee by tenant for life, absolutely void to all purposes, instead of making it a forfeiture of the particular estate of the feoffor though void as a conveyance; so that I would get rid of the necessity of trustees being interposed to save the contingent uses from destruction. Again, I would restore the Statute of Uses to what it was clearly intended to be. Our ancestors made that law, by which if land were given to A for the use of B, the latter was deemed the legal owner, the use being executed in him, just as if A did not exist. It was justly observed by Lord Hardwicke, that all the pains taken by this famous law, ended in the adding of three words to a conveyance. This has been said by conveyancers to be a severe remark,* but it is perfectly * Some have questioned its authenticity, as not to be found in a MS. note of Hopkins v, Hopkins but the words are  185 correct; for the Courts of Equity invented second uses or trusts, by holding with the Courts of Law, that the statute did not apply to land given to A to the use of B, in trust for C; that it executed the use only in B, but not in C; therefore, the whole provision is evaded, by making the gift ""To the use of B in trust for C;"" and these three words send the whole matter into Chancery, contrary to the plain intent of the statute. It was also held, that copyhold estates are not within the statute in any way, and there are other nice exceptions, but not much better grounded. Can there be any reason whatever for not making all such estates legal at once, and restoring them to the jurisdiction of the common law, by recognizing, as the owner, the person to whom in reality the estate is given, and passing over him who is a mere nominal party? Another deviation from the principles I have laid down, and a great source of multiplicity of suits, is the law with respect to agreements for sales, leases, and other conveyances. Thus, if I agree with a person to give him a lease, though he, under the agreement, becomes my tenant, he is my equitable tenant only, but not my legal tenant. He may be possessed of a written agreement, signed and sealed, for a lease of ten years, and may occupy under it, but he has no lease which a Court of Law can take notice of; and if an ejectment is brought, he must go out. He may go into a Court of Equity on his agreement, if that is any comfort to him; he may apply for a decree against me to perform my agreement, but till then his claims are not recognised in a Court of Common Law. If an injunction be brought, the expenses are further multiplied. Why, I ask, should not the agreement, such as I have described, be as good as a lease; when, in substance, it is the very same thing, and only wants a word added or left out to make it the same in legal effect too? A case illustrative of this subject, far too remarkable to have been inserted: ""By this means a statute made upon great consideration, introduced in a solemn and pompous manner, by this strict construction has had no other effect than to add at most three words to a conveyance."" I Atk. 591. The remark nearly in the same words is adopted by Blackstone, who cites lord Hardwicke in confirmation of it. 2 Com. 336. 186 happened to come within my own observation. I was counsel in a case, at York, where an agreement had been entered into and possession given; but because it did not contain words of present demise, it was no lease, and, therefore, the tenant could not stand a moment against the ejectment that was brought, but was driven into the Court of Chancery, where the other party could just as little stand against him. How much inconvenience, expense, and delay, then, might be saved, if such an agreement were pronounced equivalent to a lease; and, in general, every thing were supposed done in one court, which may be ordered as a matter of course to be done by another, reserving, no doubt, all objections on the head of fraud, mistake, surprise, and the like, which may be raised by pleading at law, just as easily as in equity. In like manner, I would allow a legatee to sue an executor or administrator for his legacy, and the mortgagor to sue for his rights. It is always said, that in these and the like cases of active trusts, accounts must be taken; and so they must in every action where there is a matter of set-off against a demand. The old action of account might be greatly improved; and by its aid, and by reference to arbitration, where necessary, much that now goes to equity might be disposed of at law. The only reason why such cases as these, where the assets are to be marshalled, and cross claims considered, now go into the Court of Chancery, is, not for any superior fitness of that Court itself, but because of its appendages, the Masters' Office, without which it would be no better than the King's-bench to manage even long trusts, chronic cases, as they have been termed, (though every suit in Equity might be thus named). Let the Court of King's-bench have an equal number of Masters let Arbitrators be publicly appointed, to whom parties may refer before any expense has been incurred, as they do now after all the bill has been run up nay, to whom they may go without even consulting an attorney and if this machinery be found not enough effectually and properly to despatch the business of the Court, let its machinery be increased, and sure I am it would be the cheapest and most powerful that ever was set up. It would do away with the ridiculous importance attached to a few words of conveyance; it would oust the jurisdiction of the Court of Chan-  187 cery in all the matters of which I have been speaking, and which it has from time to time drawn over from the Common Law, to which those matters originally belonged. Then the Courts of Equity would be left to execute their ordinary jurisdiction in matters of account requiring a long course of time, and minute and daily attention cases calling not for decision, but superintendence, to the care of infants, idiots, and insolvent estates, and other matters which it would be impossible for a Court of Common Law effectually to take cognizance of. Again, on the same principle of avoiding multiplicity of suits, why, in ejectments, should two processes be requisite to give the plaintiff his remedy? As things now stand, after a man has succeeded in one action to establish his title to the possession, he must have recourse to another, to recover that which he ought to have obtained by one and the same verdict that established his title the mesne profits? Why could not the same jury settle the matter at once? Why is an individual driven to maintain two actions for the purpose of obtaining one and the same remedy? Or why should not the jury that tries the right, also assess the damages? Mr. Tennyson's bill, which was intended to remedy some part of this evil, is only permissive; it ought to have been compulsory. It is only recommendatory, and its recommendations are not always attended to, because the lawyers, having the choice, do not think fit to pursue that which is the least profitable; they choose the two actions, when one would suffice for the interests of justice for the interests of the plaintiff and defendant for all interests, except those of the practitioners. ii. Having now considered how the number of needless suits may be diminished, I proceed to the next head of my inquiry to ascertain how, after their number is reduced as low as possible, and those only brought into Court which ought to be tried, you may best shorten the suits brought, by disposing of them in the shortest time, and with the least expense. And this topic leads me to examine the principles which ought to be adopted for encouraging the parties to come to an amicable settlement as speedily as possible. The law cites as its warrant for certain steps in every suit, the injunction of Scripture ""Agree with thy adversary 188 quickly, whilst thou art in the way with him, lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison. Verily I say unto thee, thou shalt by no means come out thence till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing."" The latter part of the text is applicable enough to the proceedings under the English law, and this scriptural advice to compromise ought to be constantly set before the eyes of suitors in all our courts with the penalty denounced. Our law, however, no sooner adopts the principle by allowing a party to imparl, than it departs from the spirit of it; for it must be observed, that the delay of imparlance is admissible, not ""in the way,"" but in the Court, after arrest, and when the effect is only to produce unnecessary loss of time, and fees as unnecessary. Here, however, the sound principles are as obvious as before. Whatever brings the parties to their senses as soon as possible, especially by giving each a clear view of his chance of success or failure, and, above all things, making him well acquainted with his adversary's case at the earliest possible moment, will always be for the interests of justice, of the parties themselves, and indeed, of all but the practitioners. It is the practitioners generally, that determine how the matter shall proceed, and it may be imagined that their own interests are not the last attended to. The seeming interest of two parties disposed to be litigious, in many cases appears to be different from the interests of justice, although their real interest, if strictly examined, will not unfrequently be found to be the same. Now, justice is embarrassed by the disingenuousness of conflicting parties; justice wants the cases of both to be fully and early stated; but both parties take care to inform each other as little as possible, and as late as possible, of their respective merits. One tells as much of his case as he thinks good for the furtherance of his claim, and the frustration of the enemy's so does the other, only as much of his answer as may help him, without aiding his adversary; and the judge is oftentimes left to guess at the: truth in the trick and conflict of the two. The interest of the Court of Justice being to make both parties come out with the whole of their case as early as possible, the law should never lend itself to their concealments. This remark extends to the proof  189 as well as the statement of the case; an intimation of what the evidence is may often stop a cause at once. In Scotland, the law in this respect is better than ours, for no man can produce a written instrument on trial without having previously shown it to his adversary. For want of this salutary rule I have often seen the most useless litigation protracted for the sole benefit of practitioners. I was myself lately engaged in a cause, the circumstances of which will give the House an idea of the mischief. I was instructed not to show a certain receipt to the opposite party, as my client, the defendant, meant to nonsuit his adversary in great style, as he would call it. Well, the plaintiff, (an executor), stated his case, and called his witnesses to prove the debt. I did not take the trouble to cross-examine, which would have been quite unnecessary. Equally so was it to address the jury. I acknowledged the truth of all that had been sworn on the other side, but added that it was all useless, as I happened to have a receipt for the money, which had been paid to the testator. This, of course, put an end to the case. The sum sought to be recovered did not exceed twenty pounds, and the expenses could not have been less than a hundred. If that action had been brought in Scotland, it never could have come to trial, nor, indeed, been prosecuted beyond the mere demand: for, this receipt being shown, the claim would have been abandoned. Here some person or other, I will not say who, had an interest in the cause being suffered to proceed, and the law enabled him to accomplish his object. I think, Sir, the adoption of some such rule as the Scotch might be desirable. At least, it would be well to inquire how it acts in Scotland, and be guided by the result. Next, the greatest encouragement should be given to compromises in all cases. At present the law recognises the principle to a certain extent, and permits money to be paid into Court, in some instances, as cases of contract and quasi-contract, where the damages are certain. But nothing can be less judicious than restricting the power of paying money into Court, to those classes of causes, and excluding actions upon contract with uncertain damages, and actions upon tort, which are far more likely to be brought hastily or obstinately defended, because they 190 are accompanied by irritated feelings* The earliest opportunity should be afforded in all cases to each party of getting rid of the suit on receiving or making compensation. I would, therefore, extend the right of paying into Court, or tending amends, to all cases whatever. As the law now stands, it is only magistrates, officers, and other persons specially protected by the statutes of James 1st and George 2nd who can thus proceed in actions for injury offered to the person or property. But the great means of shortening litigation are to be found in an enlargement of our law of arbitrament. I much fear that this, my next proposal, may seem strange, especially as coming from a professional man for it goes directly to abridge the length and the expense of law proceedings in a great number of cases, and of preventing not a few from ever coming into Court. But it is calculated to secure justice effectually, without which no saving of expense or of time deserves the name of an improvement. Now, I do not lay claim to any peculiar disinterestedness in broaching this matter. Few persons, it is true, have less interest in diminishing the amount of business in our Courts, because there are not many who gain more by it, and to whom, therefore, the abuses which I am describing, if such they be, are more profitable. But I really believe that lopping off needless litigation, by measures calculated to lessen the expense of procedure in all its branches, would greatly increase the number of lawsuits real suits, which ought to be encouraged, as necessary to justice, but which at present are kept out of Court, by the double tax of cost and delay. The County Courts ought to be diligently reformed their process extended to matters of a larger amount, and of greater variety their officers rendered more able and effective. This improvement of itself would greatly diminish * It has been held, that money cannot be paid into Court in actions for breach of contract to deliver goods at a fixed price, (3 B. and P. 14) for dilapidations, (8. 7 R. 47.) on bond for money in a foreign currency depreciated, (57 R. 87.) Chambers J. in the first and the strongest of these cases says, ""It could not be done without violating every rule of practice."" See Com. Pleas, C. 10.  191 the number of trifling suits brought into the higher judicatures; and how can I, or any one conversant with the practice of the law, adequately express the benefits of having a speedy and cheap redress for petty wrongs, when we daily witness the evils of the opposite system! How often have I been able to trace bankruptcies and insolvencies to some lawsuit about ten or fifteen pounds, the costs of which have mounted up to large sums, and been the beginning of embarrassment. Nay, how often have we seen men in the situation described by Dean Swift, who represents Gulliver's father as mined by gaining a Chancery suit, with costs! The public generally, are little aware of the number of petty actions forming the bulk of every cause paper at Nisi Prius. Professional men can tell how many now stand for trial concerning demands under twenty pounds; how few of these have been thus far ripened by the fostering care of the profession and the offices, under a hundred pounds expense. I made the Prothonotary, four years ago, at Lancaster, give me a list of fifty verdicts obtained at the Lent assizes; the average was under fourteen pounds, including, however, two or three actions brought to try rights, where the damages were of course nominal. But if the money recovered amounted in all to less than nine hundred pounds, the costs incurred certainly exceeded five thousand pounds: fifty pounds a side being indeed a very low average of costs as between attorney and client. It is not too much to affirm that not above a tenth part of those fifty cases would ever have seen the Court at Lancaster had a right system prevailed; that is, if the parties who were to bear the heavy charge, whether of losing or seeming to gain (for the loss, generally speaking, only differed in degree) had been early apprized of their real situation and exercised their own judgment upon the question of going on or settling betimes. An extension and improvement of arbitration is one of the remedies I have ventured to suggest, at least for further discussion. If arbitrators were publicly appointed, before whom parties themselves might go in the first instance, state their grounds of contention, and hear the calm opinion of able and judicious men, upon their own statements, their anger would often be cooled, and their confidence abated, so as to do each other justice without any expense or delay. Such a tribu- 192 nal exists in France, under the name of Cour de Conciliation; in Denmark it exists; and for certain mercantile causes in Holland also. If it be thought too great a change to introduce it here, in what I deem its best form, I think much good would arise from a modification of it the appointment of public arbitrators, who might at all times sit and take references by consent, with process to compel the attendance of witnesses, and the execution of their awards. At least we should see all those cases taken before them at once, which are now brought at great cost into Courts wholly unable to try them, and are uniformly greeted with the observation from both bench and bar ""Oh an account and a set-off a hundred items so many issues no judge or jury can try it,"" after all the expense of trying it has been incurred.* iii. The course of our inquiry has thus brought us, in the third place to the commencement of a suit; and here the principles and rules which present themselves are as obvious as they are important. The first is to prevent the debtor's escape, and hinder him from delaying his creditor, by wilfully absenting himself. The second is to give the debtor due notice of the particular nature of the claim, so that he may defend himself if right, or yield if wrong, that is, if actually indebted. The third is, to give the debtor no unnecessary inconvenience, till found to be in the wrong, (that is, indebted), as far as is consistent with due security to the plaintiff against a defendant likely to escape; taking care also to protect the defendant against a plaintiff likely to oppress him with costs and leave him without remedy on dropping the suit. Now, against all these, which I consider cardinal virtues in this importtant stage of procedure, our laws offend most grievously; for, in the first place, we assume the defendant to be in the wrong, and not only so, but to be meditating flight from his country and his home; we therefore, arrest him immediately, and cast * Out of the Statute of William, Arbitration is no favourite of our law. An agreement or a covenant to refer, is waste paper; no action can be maintained for a breach of either; and Equity will not enforce the performance. (6 Ves. 818.) A great Judge said on this case, that he had since a cause he mentioned, made a rule to recommend, an Arbitration.  193 him into prison or compel him to find bail. A Member of this Honourable House, if, by the acceptance of an office, he happens, for the space of a few days, to be out of Parliament, may thus be arrested, and put to the most serious inconvenience. It might have happened the other day to the member for Oxford. If he bought twenty pounds' worth of goods on a Saturday; went to his villa and returned on Monday, on knocking at his door he might be met with an arrest, and he must then accompany the sheriff's officer to a lock-up house till he procured bail. He would then do what I understand is usual in such cases, send for his butcher and his baker, and get bailed; but a gentleman could not, after that, complain so well of the meat or bread, or the bills during the next half year. Certainly he would not be in a situation, the week after, to criticise his tradesman's conduct with a good grace. I have known worse inconvenience happen from such use being made of the law, at elections; indeed, when candidates have carried their adversary's voters to Norway, instead of letting them reach Berwick, we may believe they would not scruple to use the writ for a similar purpose. But however malicious or spiteful may be the motives of any one in so employing the process of the law, there being a probable cause of detention, and the process not being abused, no action lies against the wrong doer. If he have no accomplices, so as to fall within the charge of conspiracy, he is safe. To the wealthy, however, all these inconveniences are trivial; but how does such a proceeding operate on a poor man, or a tradesman in moderate circumstances? He has no facilities for obtaining bail; if he does, he pays one way or another afterwards for the favour; and if he cannot procure it he must go to prison. Perhaps no man ever holds up his head, or is the same man again, after having once been in prison, unless for a political offence. But, I ask, why should a man ever be arrested on mesne process at all? The honourable member for Montrose has brought this subject before the House, and he has my hearty thanks for it. On what ground of common sense does our law in this matter rest? Why should it be supposed that a man, owing twenty pounds, will leave his house, his wife, his children, his country, his pursuits; and incur voluntarily the punishment awarded for great crimes, by banishing himself for life? 194 Yet the law always proceeds on the supposition, that a man will run away the moment he has notice given him of an action for the debt. Some men might possibly act thus, but their conduct forms the exception, not the rule; and do you legislate wisely do you legislate like men of sense do you legislate with common consistency when you denounce a penalty against all men, in order to meet a case not likely to occur once in a thousand times? What would be the effect of altering the law in this respect? Could its reformation injure anyone? Certainly not; on the contrary, it would benefit all classes of the community. The very first consequence of such an alteration would be to make tradesmen less easy in giving credit, by rendering them more cautious. At present, they are induced to rely on the suddenness of personal arrest for compelling a payment of their demands, in preference to others, and thus to speculate upon the chance of payment from insolvent persons; so they enter into a competition not an honest, praiseworthy competition, in the correctness of their dealings, or the goodness of their wares but a competition in the credit they give to needy and profligate, or suspected and extravagant men, unable to pay any thing like the whole amount of debts, which the rashness or cupidity of tradesmen may allow them to contract. And on whom does the loss thus incurred by the tradesman finally fall? Not unfrequently on those who can and do pay; they have to answer for those who do not; they pay a sort of del credere in proportion to the loss incurred through giving credit a species of insurance on all bad debts. Even the more respectable customers would be all the more regular in their dealings and economical in their habits, were they never tempted by easy credits to buy what they have not money to pay for. My next objection to the present system under this head is, that no proceeding can take place in our courts unless there be an actual appearance. We outlaw a man to compel an appearance. Why do so? Why can we not proceed as in a case of ejectment, where a notice is left at the dwelling-house? Why can we not leave a writ at a man's house, stating what we sue him for; and only when we think him about to fly, call upon him to give surety? I repeat, why not send a writ to the known, domicile or house of business of the debtor; a writ, too, which shall plainly describe  195 the cause of action, instead of serving him with a writ that only tells him he is a prisoner for some reason or other, which in due time he will be informed of: and, if he cannot be found, outlawing him after nine months' delay? This is done in Holland, a mercantile country, and in Sotland, a wary country, where too great charity is not generally shown to the debtor; at least the Scotch have not the reputation of being unnecessarily merciful on such occasions; yet a writ to take the debtor's person is only obtainable there if he be in meditatione fugoe. Our process of outlawry is, in its nature, extremely foolish; its object being to compel an appearance, which, after all, is not necessary, provided he wilfully absents himself after due notice. If a man chooses to keep away, why not proceed without him after such a delay, and so many services at his place of residence as shall ensure him having a knowledge of the action? As for any scruple about proceeding against an absent man, without making perfectly sure of his having notice, the present law has no right to say a word on the subject; for its process of outlawry is neither more nor less than a mean by which you harass an absent man, without even pretending to give him notice. He may be in the Greek Islands, on the coast of Africa, or in the back woods of America, and his creditor can outlaw him, and proceed to have his goods forfeited without his being aware of the transaction, and without the proceeds of the forfeiture necessarily benefiting any one but the Crown. In Exchequer cases, it is true, the debt and costs, not exceeding 50l. are paid out of the fund arising from selling the goods; in all other cases a party must apply to the Lords of the Treasury. Why should this be? What have the Lords of the Treasury to do with the legal remedy of plaintiffs in suits? Why send any one to the executive power for the redress which the judicial authority alone ought to administer? iv. We are now to suppose the parties in Court, and called upon to state their cases, the claim of one, and defence of the other. Anciently this pleading, as it is termed, was by word of mouth; but in more modern times it has been carried on in writing. Originally, too, pleas were in French, afterwards in Latin, and, for a century past, by a great, but most salutary innovation, doubtless much reviled and dreaded in its day, they have been con- 196 ducted in English. I must own that I approach the subject of Special Pleading, in the presence of my most worthy friend and learned instructor in that art, (Sir N. C. Tindal,) with some degree of awe. That excellent person's attainments in its mysteries are well known, and justly appreciated. He is intimately acquainted with the subject. The distrust of my own learning therein, while addressing him, is not lessened by my recollection of the praises lavished upon it by high authorities of past times. Lord Coke deemed it so delightful a science, that its very name was derived, according to him, from its; pleasurable nature: ""Quia bene placitare omnibus placet."" Incapable of inventing a new pleasure, I would fain restore a lost one, by bringing back pleading to somewhat of its pristine state, when it gave our; ancestors such exquisite recreation. Certain it is, that our deviations from the old rules in this branch of the law has been attended with evil effects. Those rules, as Lord Mansfield once said, were founded in reason and good sense; accuracy and; justice were their object, and in the details much of ingenuity and subtlety was displayed; but by degrees the good sense has disappeared, and the I ingenuity and subtlety have increased beyond measure, and been oftentimes misdirected; nay, to such a pitch have the changes proceeded, that at last subtlety has superseded sense; accuracy and justice are well nigh lost sight of, and ingenuity is exhausted in devising pretexts for prolixity and means of stratagem. In these really hurtful innovations the courts of law have been the far too ready accomplices: and the legislature has been a most willing instrument, to increase the evil, by sanctioning, almost as a matter of course, in each new act, the power of pleading the general issue; so that to call the modern practice by the name of special pleading is an abuse of terms. It can be only restored to its ancient condition, and made deserving, if not of Lord Coke's panegyric, yet of the more measured commendations of Lord Mansfield, by reviewing the entire system as it at present stands. My wish is, as far as possible, to revive the accuracy of the old pleading, without its niceties and verbosity; while pains are taken to improve it where this can safely be done, by adapting it to the advanced state of modern jurisprudence. The precedents of the ancient pleaders,  197 and the other rules recognized in their times, furnish the most valuable materials for this reform; and, indeed, it is chiefly from the science as they left it that the principles I am about to state are drawn. The first great rule of pleading should be to induce and compel the litigant parties to disclose fully and distinctly the real nature of their respective contentions, whether claim or defence, as early as possible. The second is, that no needless impediment should be thrown in the way of either party, in any stage of the discussion within the Court, whether plea, replication, or rejoinder, whereby he may be hindered to propound his case in point of fact, or of law. In the third place, all needless repetitions, and, generally, all prolixity should, as well as all mere reasoning, which neither simply affirms nor denies any proposition of fact or of law, be prevented; and all repugnant or inconsistent pleas should be disallowed. That these were the principles on which the ancient pleaders bottomed their system entirely, I will not affirm; but upon them it was mainly built; and I regret to say, that the last century and a half has witnessed great and prejudicial alterations in the original plan: so that the record, instead of exhibiting a plain view of what each party is prepared to prove, in the great majority of cases, contains an endless multitude of words, from which, if the real matter in dispute can be gathered at all, it is only by guess work, or by communications out of the record relating to things, of which it gives not even a hint. Let us look into this a little more narrowly. The count of a declaration should convey information as to the subject of the action; but it conveys no precise knowledge of the plaintiff's demand, or of indeed what the suit is about. Take the instance of the Common Counts, as they are justly termed, being those constantly resorted to; and take the most common of these, the count for money had and received. I will take no advantage of the audience I speak before, being unacquainted with legal niceties, in order to make merry with the venerable formalities of the art. All lawyers know how easy it would be in this place to raise a smile, at the least, by recounting the little fooleries of our draftsmen; but I disdain it; and will treat the subject precisely as if I were addressing professional men. The plaintiff declares, that the defendant, be- 198 ing indebted to him for so much money had and received to the use of the said plaintiff, to wit, one thousand pounds, undertook and faithfully promised to pay it but broke his engagement; and the count is thus framed, the self-same terms being invariably used, whatever be the cause of action which can be brought into Court under this head. Now, observe how various the matters are which may be all described by the foregoing words. In the first place, such is the declaration for money paid by one individual to another, for the use and benefit of the plaintiff""; this is what alone the words of the count imply, but to express this they are rarely, indeed, made use of. Secondly, The selfsame terms are used on suing for money received on a consideration that fails, and used in the same way to describe all the endless variety of cases which can occur of such failure, as an estate sold with a bad title, and a deposit paid; a horse sold with a concealed unsoundness, and so forth. Thirdly, The same words are used when it is wished to recover money paid under a mistake of fact. Fourthly, To recover money paid by one person to a stakeholder, in consideration of an illegal contract made with another person*. Fifthly, Money paid to revenue officers for releasing the goods illegally detained, of the person paying+. Sixthly, To try the right to any office, instead of bringing an assize ++. Seventhly, To try the liability of the landlord for rates levied on his tenant. What intimation, then, does such a declaration give? It is impossible, on reading this count, to say which of the seven causes of action has arisen; and it is not merely those seven, for each one of them has a vast number of varieties, which are declared on in the same words. In actions of trover the case is even worse. Suppose the case of a plaintiff suing for any chattel, as a gun, the declaration will be such as may apply equally to at least eight different heads, under each of which are many different causes of action. The words in all would be the very same that the plaintiff' was possessed of a gun, as of his own proper goods and chattels; that he accidentally lost it; that the defendant found it, and converted it to his use. Now this count describes only one case, that of a gun lost by its owner, and detained by the finder. But * 1 B. and P. 3. lb. 296 + 4 T. R. 485. ++ Str. 747. Carth. 95. 1 T. R. 255.  199 it is employed to mean: secondly, That the gun has been taken by the defendant, under pretence of some title, or in any way not felonious. Thirdly, That it was deposited with the defendant, who refused to deliver it up. Fourthly, That it was stopped in transitu, the price not having been paid. Fifthly, That the plaintiff is the assignee of a bankrupt, and seeks to recover the gun, as having been sold after the bankruptcy of the vendor. Sixthly, That the plaintiff has been improperly made a bankrupt, and sues the assignees to try the bankruptcy. Seventhly That his goods have been unlawfully taken, and he sues to try the validity of an execution, on any of the various grounds of fraud, &c. which impeach the validity of the process. Eighthly. That the gun has been misdelivered, or detained by a warehouseman or carrier. All those causes of action differ from each other as much as different things can differ; and yet they are all stated in the declaration the same way, and signified under the same form of words. The pleadings in cases where it might be expected that the greatest particularity would be given to the statement, actions upon torts to the person, are somewhat, but for the most part, not remarkably more definite and precise in their description. The declarations on the seduction of a wife, servant, or daughter, assault, and false imprisonment, are drawn so that you can say, no doubt, what the action is about, which, you hardly ever can in cases of assumpsit or trover; but the same form of words is used, whatever the particular shape of the cause may be. Of the circumstances peculiar to the transaction the pleadings tell the defendant nothing they tell the counsel nothing they tell the judge nothing. It may be said, that the defendant must know the cause of action himself; but that does not always follow, especially if (which may be presumed barely possible, though it seems never to be thought so) the allegations are groundless. There is, however, one person who must know the cause of action, and that is the plaintiff. He ought, for the satisfaction of all concerned, to state it distinctly. The same may be said of the counts in trespass, for taking goods. In trespass quare clausum fregit, perhaps, the description of the wrong done is more specific. But it happens that the circumstances here are of far less importance; damages are not in question; a shilling or 200 so is to be recovered, the object of the action being almost always to try a right of property or an easement. In all other cases of trespass, where a knowledge of the wrong suffered is most material, the parties are left to fight, and the Court to decide, in the dark; but in the case I have just alluded to, where a knowledge of the circumstances in which the trespass was committed is immaterial, every thing is told to them of which it is wholly unimportant that they should be informed; in a cumbrous way, no doubt, and with much fanciful statement, but still it is told. Actions for slander and libel, for malicious prosecutions, and malicious arrest, or holding to bail, with others on the case, are very particular, and form certainly, an exception to the ordinary course of pleading; at least, as far as the declaration goes; no further, as we shall presently see for I now proceed to the next stage of the pleadings; namely, to the pleas which the defendant puts upon the record in answer to the plaintiff's complaints. In this stage of the cause we encounter the same evils, but in greater abundance; for they affect those actions on the case where the count is most precise. Generally speaking, it may be said, that if the plaintiff tell us nothing in his declaration, the defendant, in return, tells us as little in his plea; in that respect, at least, they are even. This is, perhaps, a consequence of the former evil; but, be that as it may, it ought to be remedied. The plaintiff ought to tell the defendant the real nature of his complaint, and the defendant ought to make him equally acquainted with the nature of his answer. If this were always done, perjury would not so often be committed; every thing intended to be proved would be stated on each side, and the parties, knowing the evidence on which the respective statements must be established, would have an opportunity of examining into the character of the witnesses, and of procuring the best evidence to elucidate the point. At present, the mystery of pleading leaves them in doubt; and the vague and indistinct statements on the record, unaccompanied by other information, open a door to the entrance of falsehood in the witnesses, far wider than any you could open, by enabling them to get up proofs in answer to those expected from the opposite side. Whenever the parties fight each other by trick, on the record in the first instance, fencing to evade telling  201 their grounds of contention, they renew the fight afterwards by perjury in Court. I will now give the House some instances of the vagueness of this part of pleading. In the indebitatus assumpsit, from which I took my first example, the general issue is non assumpsit. Now, under that plea no less than eight different defences may be set up; as, for instance, a denial of the contract, payment, usury, gaming, infancy, accord and satisfaction, release, and coverture. All these defences are entirely different, and yet they are all stated in the self-same words. So, too, in the action of trover; take our former case of the gun: the defendant, under the plea of ""not guilty,"" may set up as a defence, that he is a gamekeeper, and took it by virtue of the statute of Charles II*; or that he had a lien upon it, as a carrier for his general balance, and had, therefore, a right to detain it; or a particular lien for work done upon it; or that he had received it as a deposit, and was entitled to keep it; or that he took it for toll+, or detained it till passage money due by its owner were paid++ or the reward due for saving it from shipwreck SS. Any one of these defences may be concealed under the plea of ""not guilty,"" without the possibility of the plaintiff discovering which it is that his adversary means to set up; so that every body will, I think, agree with me, that if the count teaches the Court and opposite party little, the plea teaches them not a whit more. It is of these things that Mr. Justice Blackstone must be speaking, when he thus eloquently closes his account of special pleading and actions (not otherwise remarkable for accuracyP with a merited panegyric upon that perfection which it shares in his eyes with all the rest of our system. ""This care and circumspection in the law, in providing that no man's right shall be affected by any legal proceeding without giving him previous notice, and yet that the debtor shall not, by receiving such notice, take occasion to escape from justice; in requiring that every complaint be accurately and precisely ascertained in writing, and be as pointedly * St. 22. 23.

The inconsistency of many of our rules of pleading for his the next head of complaint to which I shall direct your attention, and it is just as manifest as the vagueness and indistinctness I have been pointing out. Why are infancy and coverture to be given in evidence under the general issue, while other defences of a similar description must be pleaded specially, as the statute of limitations always, and leave and licence in trespass? If it is right that specific defences, of which your general plea gives your opponent no notice, should be couched under that plea, why should you be compelled to give notice of other averments before suffered to prove them? Why do you, in one case, multiply pleas, which, in the other, your own practice declares to be unnecessary? One or other course, the vague or the precise, the prolix or the concise, may be fitting; both cannot be right. Nay, there is often an option given as to the same thing; infancy, coverture, release, accord and satisfaction, and others, may either be given under the general issue in assumpsit, or pleaded. Why, this choice amounts to no rule at all! If a ground of defence is ever to be pleaded specially, why not always? A-kin to this inconsistency of principle is the variety of repugnant counts and pleas allowed in all cases whatever. Where there are ten different ways of stating a defence, and all of them are employed, it is hardly possible that any three of them can be true; at the same time their variety tends to prevent both the opposite party and the Court from knowing the real question to be tried. Yet this practice is ge- * 3 Com. 423,  203 nerally resorted to, because neither party knows accurately what course his opponent may take; each, therefore, throws his drag-net over the whole ground, in hopes to avail himself of every thing which cannot escape through his meshes. Take the case of debt on bond. The first plea in such an action, almost as a matter of course, is the general issue, non est factum, whereby the defendant denies that it is his deed; the second as usually is, solvit ad diem he paid it on the day mentioned in the bond, a circumstance not very likely to happen, if it be not his deed; the third is solvit post diem he paid it after the day; a thing equally unlikely to happen, if it be not his bond, or if he paid it when due; and a fourth often is, a general release. What can a plaintiff learn from a statement in which the defendant first asserts that he never executed the deed, and next, that he not only executed it, but has moreover paid it off? Where pleas are consistent with each other, it may be well to let them be pleaded in unlimited abundance: where they are not only not consistent, but absolutely destructive of each other, it would be a good rule to establish that such pleas should not be put together upon the record, at least without some previous discussion, and leave obtained. The grounds of action are often stated with almost as great inconsistency almost always with greater multiplicity in the declaration. I recollect that at York, many years ago, it was my duty, as junior counsel, to open the pleadings in an action brought upon a wager which had been laid upon the life of the Emperor Napoleon. I stated to the jury in the usual way, that the defendant, in consideration of one hundred guineas, agreed to pay the plaintiff a guineas a-day during the life of one Napoleon Buonaparte, and so forth, alleging the breach. Thus far all was well, and the audience were not disturbed; but there was not much gravity among them, when I went on to state the second count, averring another wager on the life of ""one other Napoleon Buonaparte"" and, indeed, though one in those days was quite enough for the rest of the world, two did not satisfy the pleader, who made mention of a third and a fourth Napoleon. I know that it is frequently said these allegations deceive nobody, and their vagueness and repugnancy keep no one in the dark, for each party contrives to have 204 a good guess of what his adversary means. That this is not the case in many instances I know; that it takes place more frequently than might be expected, I am ready to admit. But what vindication is this of the system? If any thing like precise information is obtained in such cases as I have described, it is most assuredly not from the record, but in spite of the record; it is by travelling out of it by seeking elsewhere for what the record does not give, or for correcting the false impression which it conveys; consequently, this defence of pleading is the very humble one, that it is useless, and, were it not for the cost, would be harmless. Before the statute of the 4th of Anne, no man was 'allowed to plead double; the plaintiff might have as many ways of stating his case as he pleased, but to each count the defendant could only give one answer. By that statute he may, with leave of the Court, plead two or more distinct matters. Though that leave was formerly granted or refused at the discretion of the Court, it is now regularly given as a matter of course. There is, however, a fee to be paid to the office for it, and also a fee to counsel for signing the rule to obtain it, which, of course, implies a charge by the attorney also. I believe every practitioner is fully aware of the consequences. Beside the expense, the utterly needless expense, the mischief of it is great and undeniable. I believe in my conscience, that many an attorney's clerk, who afterwards proceeds to still greater frauds, begins his career of crime by stopping this fee to counsel on its way. It is not necessary that the barrister should sign his name; and a knowledge of that, fact among attornies' clerks and barristers' clerks seduces into a course of petty embezzlement, which leads to larger peculations in the long run, and ends in all the dishonesty which marks the life of the disreputable practitioner. According to the principles before laid down, such rules as I this, to plead double, and all others of the kind, ought at once to be abolished, and the parties allowed to do, without any application, or rather supposed application, to the Judge, and without any expense, what they thus obtain for the mere payment of money. But to proceed: though the defendant may plead, the plaintiff cannot reply many matters. For instance, in indebitatus assumpsit, if the defendant pleads, first, that he never made any  205 promise, and next, that he was an infant when he made the promise, the plaintiff must either admit the infancy, and set up a subsequent promise, or deny the infancy altogether, and re-affirm the original promise; for he cannot both deny the infancy and set up a subsequent promise. Now, I will ask the House, why, if the defendant may plead several matters, the plaintiff should not reply several matters? There must be some limit, I allow, set to the replication, otherwise, at each stage of the pleading, there would be a multiplication of issues, like the puzzle of the nails in a horse-shoe; but, surely, there can be no harm in allowing each separate ground of defence to be met both by a denial and an answer; giving the plaintiff a general replication to make the defendant prove his plea, and one special replication; I mean, as long as you allow the defendant to multiply, without restraint, his grounds of defence; for the power of pleading repugnant pleas being restricted, there will be the less prolixity occasioned by enlarging the power of replying. The restriction upon demurrer, or pleading to raise an issue in law, appears still less founded in principle. By demurring, a party is obliged to confess the facts to be true as stated by the opposite party, and confine himself to a denial that, by law, those facts warrant the inference against him to raise which they are stated. If I am alleged to have made a particular promise, I may deny that I made it, which would raise a direct issue on the fact: or I may say that, though I did make it, such a promise is not binding in law, which raises an issue on the law. These two denials, however, cannot both be given; I must take my choice, either to admit the law or the fact. How is this in common life? If I am charged with any thing wrong, as using certain blameable expressions, I may deny the words altogether, but may add, ""admit, for argument sake, I did utter them, they were wholly harmless wholly free from the meaning affixed to them."" In truth, men are demurring all day long, when they are conflicting or disputing with one another, and no one ever dreamt of tying down his antagonist to an admission of the fact, because he had argued against the inference. If any thing can make the rule more objectionable, it is the gross inconsistency which it exhibits to the last rule I mentioned, the permission given to a defendant to raise as 206 many repugnant issues of fact as he pleases. Why should a party be allowed to say, ""In point of fact, I deny the promise; but, if I made it, six years have elapsed or I made it underage,"" and be prohibited from saying ""In point of fact I deny the promise; but, if I made it, there was nothing binding in point of law?"" The two defences, as far as their duplicity goes, are precisely similar; and as it must be allowed that, before double pleading was introduced, the restriction upon demurring was consistent with the general principles of the system, so, if repugnant pleas were forbidden, the objection, in respect of consistency, to a demurrer admitting the facts pleaded, would be removed. On other grounds, however, it would still be quite wrong. I admit that part of the mischief occasioned by the rule may be remedied after verdict, the objection being on the record. But beside that this remedy cannot, in every case, be applied, there has been the delay and expense, to say nothing of the absurdity of a trial of facts, which, if proved, amount to nothing. Why should not the Court first determine the disputed law, and then, only if it becomes necessary, try the truth of the facts? A very great, amendment of the law would be, to permit, all formal errors to be amended, even at the very last stage of the cause. No one should be turned round on a mere variance; no one should be defeated on a mere verbal mistake, as it was my lot to be lately in an indictment, the history of which will aptly enough introduce this head of remark. It was a prosecution for perjury: the jury was sworn, the case was opened, witnesses were examined, and documents read, when a variance was discovered between the affidavit, on which the perjury was assigned, and the copy of it which formed part of the record: in the one the word ""grandmother"" was used: in the record the syllable ""grand"" was omitted, and only the two last syllables ""mother"" were inserted. This was, of course, fatal to the indictment. There can be no doubt that the perjury, which consisted in the denial of a payment, was equally committed, whether that supposed payment was made to the mother or the grandmother; yet, owing to this utterly unimportant error, all the trouble of the Court, and all the expense of the prosecutor, were rendered perfectly useless, and the ends  207 of public justice frustrated. In ninety-nine cases out of every hundred indeed, I might say, in nine hundred and ninety-nine cases out of every thousand in which parties are turned round upon variances, the materiality is not greater than in that which I have just mentioned to the House. The improvement which I would suggest is to allow nobody to be turned round upon a variance, except at the discretion of the Judge. Where it is clear that the record by its variance from the evidence has deceived the party, then the discrepancy ought to be fatal; but because this may happen once in a thousand times, ought we to legislate upon the exception, and introduce a general system of quirks and niceties upon sorry trifles the greatest opprobrium of the law? Furthermore, I would allow no failure of a case from the want of a sufficient stamp being affixed to any instrument used in evidence. In a case which occurred not long since, my Lord Dudley was turned round, because it was said there were a few words more in the instrument than we had counted, and the stamp was some half-crown below the amount required. At the trial of the cause, it was not disputed by us, that the words were more in number than the stamp covered; we took for granted that our adversary had reckoned right, and we did not require the process of addition to be gone through in Court; it was afterwards found out that the defendant had counted the words wrong, and that they fell short of the number mentioned in the Stamp Act. The plaintiff, in consequence, got a rule for a new trial. But suppose we had been wrong and he right, what difference would that have made in the justice of the cause, which was truly an undefended one? I would allow the judge to inflict a penalty of 20l., of 50l., if necessary, to protect the revenue, instead of 10l. for the want of a stamp; but I would not allow the party to be turned round, and to lose his trial, because he had got a wrong stamp, or no stamp at all, affixed to his agreement or deed. Let not the House suppose that grievances, such as I have been describing to flow naturally from the present system, are imaginary and theoretical. I can assure the House, from my own daily experience, that they are not: they produce constantly a cost or a delay, amounting to the positive denial of justice. To give an illustration of some of the parts of the 208 system in its workings, I shall read the letter which I hold in my hand, from an eminent practitioner in the law. The widow of a Welsh clergyman was obliged to bring an action upon a mortgage-deed for the payment of the mortgage-money and interest, and for performance of the covenants in the deed. She might have foreclosed by a proceeding in equity; but preferring the delays of the King's-bench to those of the Chancery, she brought an action of debt of the simplest possible kind, both in its nature, and in the form of the proceedings; and the House shall now hear from her solicitor himself, what was the progress and termination of that action. ""The defendant was a Member of Parliament, and some delay, as is usual with such defendants,"" (I beg pardon, Sir of course I am not answerable for the terms of the letter) ""took place in enforcing an appearance. When the declaration was delivered, the defendant demanded oyer of the bond, and that obtained, made as many applications as the Judge would allow for further time to plead. At the expiration of this period, he pleaded 1st, Non est factum  2nd, Solvit ad diem 3rd, Solvit ante diem* 4th, Solvit post diem 5th, Performances. It is needless to add, all these pleas were pure legal fictions. The plaintiffs, in their replication, took issue on such pleas as concluded to the contrary, and assigned breaches of the condition, according to the statute. The breaches assigned were, non-payment of the principal non-payment of the interest and non-performance of the covenants of the * Had the plaintiff's pleader chose, the law enabled him to demur to this plea (but it would have increased the delay and served the defendant's purpose.) The ground of the doctrine, that paying before the debt falls due is no answer to the action seems not very intelligible but it is now settled law. The reason assigned (in Cross v. Tryon though there are cases contra, Cro. Eliz. 143, Dyer 222 and see 14 Ann, c. 16. SS 12.) is that if the verdict on that issue goes for the plaintiff, it by no means follows that he has a right to recover, for he may have been paid at or after the day. But so it may be said of a plea of infancy or, indeed, of solvit ad diem itself for though the verdict negative that plea, non constat that there may not have been duress or a release. The true test of a plea (or an affirmative issue tendered at any stage of the pleadings) plainly is this if its being found for him who pleads it decides the matter in his favour, it is good if not, bad.  209 mortgaged-deed. The defendant, for the purpose of splitting the second into two issues, and thereby creating the delay of an issue in law, to be tried before the court in banco, and an issue in fact, to be afterwards tried at Nisi Prius before a jury, demurred to the last assignment of breaches a sham demurrer for delay. The plaintiffs joined in demurrer, and made up and delivered the paper-book and demurrer-book. The defendant, in order to entitle himself to bring a writ of error for delay, without giving bail, then suffered judgment to go by default, for not returning the paper and demurrer-book. The consequence of this was, that all the pleas, replications, rejoinders and demurrer, became useless, and were struck out of the record; and the plaintiffs had to execute a writ of inquiry before the chief justice, under the statute of William III. to assess damages on the breaches suggested. But these proceedings had answered the purpose of harassing the poor defendant with useless and expensive litigation, swelling the pleadings from five folios to one hundred and eighteen; and they had already accomplished much delay, having occupied four terms: the bill was filed in Trinity Term, the pleas and replication in Michaelmas Term, the demurrer and joinder in Hilary Term, and the final judgment was obtained in Easter Term. The defendant then brought a writ of error, without the slightest pretence of actual errror; and that proceeding, of course, delayed the plaintiffs four terms longer. All this was necessarily attended with expense, grievous to a poor person, as the party in this case was. The costs of the judgment were taxed at 80l. 4s., and the costs in error at 19l. 10s., making together 99l. 14s. for the costs, and two years for the delay in an undefended action, in which the length of the declarations was five folios! Comment on such a case would be a waste of words."" It would indeed! But if it be wanted, Blackstone shall be the commentator. ""So tender and circumspect,"" saith he, ""is the law of England in providing that no man's right shall be affected by any legal proceeding; in requiring that every complaint be accurately and precisely ascertained in writing, and be as pointedly and exactly answered; in clearly stating the law and the fact; in deliberately resolving the former and indisputably fixing the latter by a dilligent trial; in correcting such errors as may have arisen in 210 either decision, and in finally enforcing the judgment, when nothing can be alleged to impeach it! So anxious it is to maintain and restore to every individual the enjoyment of his civil rights, without intrenching upon those of any other individual in the nation, so parentally solicitous is our whole legal constitution to preserve that spirit of equal liberty, which is the singular felicity of the British nation."" I must now tell the House, that besides the 99l. 14s. taxed costs, this poor widow had to pay 30l. for extra costs, which she never received a shilling of from the defendant, and which she had to defray after he had handed his share of the costs over to the plaintiff's attorney. In prosecuting an undefended cause she paid this sum, and if it had so chanced that the defendant, instead of being merely a distressed man, (for I happen to know the gentleman in question, and that though a distressed he is not an oppressive man) if he had been such a character as was once known in the northern provinces, and as we have had represented on the scene, pertinacious, litigious, grasping, oppressive, with a long purse to back him in defending acts of injustice and cruelty, he would have resisted at every stage of the action by counsel and witnesses; he would have had the demurrer argued before the Court; he would have tried the issue at Nisi Prius; he would have carried his Writ of Error through the Exchequer Chamber into the House of Lords; and then the extra costs, instead of 30l., would have amounted to I dare not say what sum, knowing that costs to the amount of 500l. have been incurred to recover a debt of 19l. ""So tender is the law of England in providing that no man's right should be affected by any legal proceeding so parental its solicitude to maintain and restore to every individual the enjoyment of his civil rights, without intrenching upon those of any other person whatsoever."" Sir, after Mr. Justice Blackstone had written his beautiful and, in part, profound Commentaries, there occurred a case, which he published himself in his Reports, and which must, I conclude, have happened after the panegyrics were composed. I marvel much, however, that, when a subsequent edition of his Commentaries appeared, he did not correct the error into which he must then have been convinced that he had been betrayed, by his  211 excessive admiration for the forms and technicalities of our common law. The case, as reported by himself, was, in substance, this: A gentleman of the name of Robinson, in Yorkshire, was minded to try the resources of the law in an action of trespass against some poor men, who lived near him. In the course of it, reference was made to the Master, to report by whose fault the pleadings in the action had extended to a most enormous and unprecedented length. The Master reported, that in the declaration there were five counts; that twenty-seven several pleas of justification were pleaded by the defendants, which, with replications, traverses, new assignments, and other muniments of pleading, amounted at length to a paper book of near two thousand sheets. He was of opinion that the fault lay principally in the length and intricacy of the declaration, the action being only brought to try whether the freeholders and copyholders of the manor of Ellerton, in Yorkshire, whereof Mr. Luke Robinson was lord, were entitled to common in a ground called the Inclosure. He likewise reported, that the declaration was so catching, by ringing changes upon the several defendants, and the several names of the ground, that it was necessary for the defendants to guard every loophole; which made their pleas so various and so long, especially as Mr. Robinson had declared, that he had drawn the declaration in this manner ""on purpose to catch the defendants, and that he would scourge them with a rod of iron."" The Court was very indignant at this abuse of the technicalities of the law, and the reporter says, that Mr. Robinson appeared in propria persona, to show cause against this report, ""no other counsel caring to be employed for him."" The Court ordered Mr. Sergeant Hewitt and Mr. Winn to settle an issue, which they did in a quarter of an hour, and in the space of a quarter sheet of paper, instead of two thousand folios. Talk of scourging with a rod of iron! Why should he think of it? The lash of parchment, which is applied to all suitors in our courts of law that flapper, which keeps them awake to the course of justice by the expense and anxiety it inflicts, that truly parental corrector of human errors, manufactured in the engines of practice and pleading, which, pretending to enlighten, serve only to keep the Court and the suitors in the dark as to what they are 212 conflicting about, and oftentimes teach them nothing certain, but that they are ruined, and cannot tell how! this parchment lash was a far more safe as well as powerful scourge for the rich and crafty lawyer, and a far more deadly one for his poor and simple antagonists, than any rod of iron which he could have obtained in Colebrookdale. v. The parties being now supposed at issue by the result of their pleadings, the facts in dispute are to be tried by a jury through the medium of Evidence, and the comments of the counsel and judge. Before I enter, therefore, on the head of Evidence and Proceedings, or Trial generally, the House will permit me to say a few words upon the subject of Juries, the rather because this venerable institution has, I lament to say, been of late years, attacked by some of the most distinguished legal reformers. Speaking from experience, and experience alone, as a practical lawyer, I must aver, that I consider the method of Juries a most wholesome, wise, and almost perfect invention, for the purposes of judicial inquiry. In the first place, it controls the Judge, who might, not only in political cases, have a prejudice against one party, or a leaning towards another, but might also, in cases not avowedly political, where some chord of political feeling is unexpectedly struck, if left supreme, show a bias respecting suitors, or, what is as detrimental to justice, their counsel or attornies. In the second place, it supplies that knowledge of the world, and that sympathy with its tastes and feelings, which Judges seldom possess, and which, from their habits and station in society, it is not decent that they should possess, in a large measure, upon all subjects. In the third place, what individual can so well weigh conflicting evidence, as twelve men indifferently chosen from the middle classes of the community, of various habits, characters, prejudices, and ability? The number and variety of the persons are eminently calculated to secure a sound conclusion upon the opposing evidence of witnesses or of circumstances. Lastly, what individual can so well assess the amount of damages which a plaintiff ought to recover for any injury he has received? How can a Judge decide half so well as an intelligent Jury, whether he should recover as a compensation for an assault fifty pounds or a hundred pounds damages?   213 or for the seduction of his wife or daughter, fifteen hundred, or two thousand, or five thousand pounds damages? The system is above all praise it looks well in theory, and works well in practice it wants only one thing to render it perfect namely, that it should be applied to those cases from which the practice in equity has excluded it; and that improvement would be best, effected by drawing back to it the cases which the courts of equity have taken from the common law, and which they constantly evince their incapacity to deal with, by sending issues to be tried whenever any difficulty occurs. I shall not press this subject further, for I begin to feel that I shall be exhausted with the labour I have undertaken, and I fear that your patience may be exhausted with my strength. I will, therefore, proceed to the great subject of Evidence; and, first of all, we are met by the question. Ought the testimony of the Parties to be excluded? The strong opinion expressed by some great authorities on this head requires that, before entering on the Law of Evidence, we should touch the fundamental rule which draws so broad a line between parties and witnesses. It is clear that the law on this head requires revising; it is not so clear that the reform will be best accomplished by receiving every one's testimony in his own cause. The friend of exclusion proceeds upon the supposition, that the situation of a party differs wholly from that of another person; whereas it only differs in the degree of the bias arising out of interest, from the situation of many who are every day allowed to depose. He also maintains that it is dangerous to receive the party's evidence, because of the temptation afforded to perjury. That there is much in this argument, I admit; but, speaking from my own observation, I should say that there is more risk of rash swearing, than of actual perjury of the party becoming zealous and obstinate, and seeing things in false colours, or shutting his eyes to the truth, and recollecting imperfectly, or not at all, when his passions are roused by litigation. I shall not easily forget a case in which a gentleman of large fortune appeared before an able arbitrator, now filling an eminent judicial place, on some dispute of his own, arising out of an election. It was my lot to cross-examine him. I had got a great number of letters in a pile under my hand, but concealed 214 from him by a desk. He was very eager to be heard in his own cause. I put the question to him: ""Did you never say so and so?"" His answer was distinct and ready, ""Never."" I repeated the question in various forms, and with more particularity, and lie repeated his answers, till he had denied most pointedly all he had ever written on the matter in controversy. This passed before the rule of evidence laid down by the Judges in the Queen's case; consequently I could examine him without putting the letters into his hand. I then removed the desk, and said, ""Do you see what is now under my hand?"" pointing to about fifty of his letters. ""I advise you to pause before you repeat your answer to the general question, whether or not all you have sworn is correct."" He rejected my advice, and not without indignation. Now, those letters of his contained matter in direct contradiction to all he had sworn. I do not say that he perjured himself, far from it. I do not, believe that he intentionally swore, what was false; he only forgot what he had written some time before. Nevertheless he had committed himself, and was in my client's power. I said, ""My advice is, that you pay the whole demand before to-morrow."" This only increased his anger; he ""scorned the offer and the imputation."" Turning to his solicitor, I asked if he concurred in his client's view of my proposition. ""Very far from it,"" was the answer. The meeting broke up, the arbitration terminated, and the money was paid the next, morning. Now, had this trial occurred in an open court, the gentleman would have been ruined for ever; he would have had no opportunity of explaining, nay, all explanation would have been useless; if he had escaped prosecution, he would have been suspected of perjury ever after, when all that he was guilty of was too much eagerness, too much impetuosity, and a little wrong-headedness, arising from confidence in his own cause, and a desire to defeat, his adversary. But this anecdote is fruitful in Platter of reflection. On the one hand, we see the risks of admitting impure or uncertain evidence, and the probability of receiving wrong impressions respecting a witness's bias while undergoing the question; on the other hand, we perceive, that it, to a certain degree, the same consequences flow from our present practice of allowing such evidence in some  215 cases, and not in all. Our system is clearly inconsistent in this particular. At least we ought to be uniform in our practice. Why refuse to allow a party in a cause to be examined before a Jury, when you allow him to swear in his own behalf in your Courts of Equity, in your Ecclesiastical Courts, and even in the mass of business decided by Common Law Judges on affidavit? Why is the rule reversed on passing from one side of Westminster Hall to the other, as if the laws of our nature had been changed during the transit; so that no party being ever allowed before a Jury to utter a syllable in his own cause, in all cases before an Equity Judge parties are fully sworn to the merits of their own cause? If it be said, that there is no cross-examination here, I answer, that this is a very good argument to show the inefficacy of Equity proceedings for extracting truth from defendants, but no reason for following a different rule in the two jurisdictions. Indeed, the inconsistencies of our system in this respect almost pass comprehension. All pleas at law are pleaded without any restriction upon their falsehood; in Equity the defendant answers under the sanction of an oath. But Equity is as inconsistent with itself as it is different from Common Law; for the plaintiff may aver as freely as he pleases, without any oath or any risk at all. When an inquiry is instituted into these things, I do venture to hope that something will be done to diminish the number of matters decided on affidavit. This is, indeed, a fruitful parent of fraud and perjury, and not only a great departure from the principle which excludes the testimonies of parties, but an abuse of all principle; for he who would allow such testimony, under due restraints, may very naturally argue, that suffering men to swear for themselves without being exposed to cross-examination must lead to endless equivocation, suppression of truth, and all the moral guilt, without the danger, of actual perjury. If it be right to exclude the parties from giving evidence in their own behalf in one case, it is not right to admit them to give evidence in others; and more especially is it absurd to admit them where they have the power of deceiving with impunity, and exclude them where they would swear under checks and restraints. The first matter that presents itself to my attention, when I come to the subject 216 of evidence, is the great question (intimately connected with what I have been discussing,) how far interest should disqualify a witness. The ancient doctrine upon this point has, of late years, been so much restricted by our Courts of Law, so little is left of the principle on which this objection to incompetency rested, that, for my own part, I will confess I cannot see any adequate reason why all witnesses of good fame, that is, all not convicted of an infamous offence, should not be admitted, leaving the question of their credibility, and the weight of their testimony, to the consideration of the jury. In the case of ""Bent v. Baker,"" an action against one underwriter of a policy, the Court held that another underwriter of the same policy was a competent witness for the defendant, because the verdict could not be evidence in an action against himself, although it was clear that the first action must, in fact, decide both claims. After that decision it cannot be said, that there is any rational ground for exclusion on account of interest in the event, any more than interest in the question. The rule thus established has ever since been followed; and now, in all cases, a person is competent, whatever bias he may have from interest, provided the verdict against him cannot be given for him in another cause; the bias under which he swears being only a circumstance that goes to his credit. After this it is in vain to exclude any evidence upon the ground of interest in the event, and the principle should be extended to all interest direct or indirect. For let the House look at the inconsistency of the present system. If I have the most distant interest, even the interest of a shilling, in reversion on an estate of 50,000l. a year, I am incompetent to give evidence on any point affecting that estate; but suppose I have a father, ninety years of age, lunatic, bedridden, at the point of death, and quite incapable of doing any legal act whatever; that he is in possession of an estate in fee-simple; that I expect to be his heir; or that he had formerly made a valid will in my favour, so that nothing can prevent me from succeeding the moment he dies, I may be a witness to give him the estate, I am competent to swear into the possession of my father a property of 50,000l. a year, to which, in the common course of events, I must myself succeed in a few months. But pecuniary interest  217 is not the only feeling that biasses the mind of a witness; and yet any one may swear for a parent, a brother, a sister, a child, on questions most nearly affecting the peace, and honour, and happiness of the whole family. I therefore think that a line ought to be drawn, not between one sort of interest and another, but between competency and credit; and that all should be admitted to give evidence, leaving it to the jury to determine what dependence may be placed upon their testimony. This is rendered the more fit by the nature of the shifts resorted to for the purpose of restoring the competency of interested witnesses; I allude, of course, to that notable expedient, a release of all actions or causes of action. When a witness has an interest, if he is deprived of it by a release, there is no objection to his competency. Evidence is thus often cooked up for the Court, nay, in the Court, while the witness is in the box, which, according to the existing rules, is not admissible, without such a process. Now, what is the real effect of the release on the mind of the witness? Just nothing for if he be an honourable man he gives it up the moment he leaves the box, and while swearing he knows that he is to do so; so that, the operation being performed upon him adds a pound to the year's revenue, nothing to the credit of his testimony. With regard to written evidence, I must say that it appears to be no less capriciously required than dispensed with. I think as highly as any lawyer ever did of the Statute of Frauds; I would go the full length of the learned judge who said, that every line in it was worthy a subsidy; and it is, therefore, that I could wish a few lines might be added, so as to increase the number of subsidies at which I may value it. First, I would extend the number of cases in which written evidence is exacted. The French law requires that all contracts for sums above one hundred and fifty francs should be reduced into writing, and even authenticated by notarial forms. I would adopt some such extension of our statute; and as almost all men are able to write at the present day, I do not think this would occasion any inconvenience. But then the outlets should be stopt up, by which the exigency of the statute is escaped. I think, as far as I can discern from reading the French Code Civile, and the Conferences upon it, (a wonderful 218 monument of Napoleon's genius, as well as of the talents of his councillors,) that no part performance takes a case out of the French enactment. With us the things are so numerous which take cases out of the Statute of Frauds, that the memorandum in writing is only in a small proportion of cases required. Hence, among other consequences, much subtlety of construction often needlessly extended by jurisconsult exercitations, as the distinction between crops growing and severed, or a right and an easement, in determining what is an interest in land*. A judicious enactment, restoring the force of the Statute in these particulars, as well as extending it to other cases, would be highly beneficial in preventing fraud, forgery, and litigation, and could offer no impediment to commerce, further than the beneficial one of narrowing the credit given by small tradesmen. The rule by which a man's books are let in or excluded after his decease, is also, in my mind, extremely defective. They are evidence, if he has entered the receipt of sums by which he makes himself chargeable to any amount. If he only debits himself with the receipt of 5l. which very likely he may have received, he makes his books evidence for his representatives, who may gain 500l. to which he never was entitled. The ground on which they ought to be excluded is, the general probability of their having been made for the purpose of creating evidence; but that probability is never weighed at all in the particular instance. We had much discussion of this matter in the case of Barker v. Wray, beford Lord Eldon, who appeared exceedingly to question the soundness of the received rule; this at least was certainly the impression of the bar. Would it not be better to abolish the legal presumption, exceedingly ill-founded in fact, which lets in all such documents generally, and as generally excludes all others, and to substitute in its place the rule, that any deceased person's books or memorandums may be received, provided it appear that they were not prepared with a view of making evidence for * Thus a license for any number of years to stack coals on a close is not within the statute; this complete occupation of every inch of the surface, and exclusive of all other use of it, even by way of easements, is not held to be an interest in land. There is a case to this effect in Sayers's Reports.  219 his successors, but plainly alio intuitu? Observe, too, that in one case we admit, without any qualification, the books of a predecessor, in his successor's behalf. I mean entries made by a deceased rector or vicar of the receipt of tithes, which are always admitted as evidence for succeeding incumbents, because he is supposed to have had no interest in mis-stating the fact as if the clergy were always entirely free from a corporation spirit. Than as to the rules for the examination of witnesses, I am of opinion that nothing can be better, generally speaking. Every facility is afforded to counsel for extracting the truth. Upon this important head, therefore, my remarks will be few. There is a want of uniformity in the practice of the judges towards counsel engaged in examination. Some will not allow them to cross-examine a witness whom they have called themselves, even though he is stated when produced to be a hostile one; and others will not allow them to put a leading question to an adversary's witness, in cross-examination, if he be really friendly to them. The sound rule seems to be that it depends on the connexions and demeanour of the witness, whether he shall be regarded as the witness of the party producing him or no. Again, certain tests are excluded, by which the capacity and the credit of a witness may best be tried. If I wish to put a witness's memory to the test, I am not allowed to examine him as to the contents of a letter or other paper which he has written. I must put the document into his hands before I ask him any questions upon it, though by so doing he at once becomes acquainted with its contents, and so defeats the object of my inquiry. That question was raised and decided in the Queen's case, after solemn argument, and I humbly venture to think, upon a wrong ground, namely, that the writing is the best evidence and ought to be produced, though it is plain that the object is by no means to prove its contents. Neither am I, in like manner, allowed to apply the test to his veracity: and yet, how can a better means be found of sifting a person's credit, supposing his memory to be good, than examining him to the contents of a letter, written by him, and which he believes to be lost? There is another test, excluded in cases of Libel, of which I shall say the less, as I brought in a Bill some years ago to remedy this defect. The main question in any prosecu- 220 tion for Libel being the innocence or guilt of the publication, is it not preposterous to keep the proof of its truth or falsehood from the view of the Court? Almost every thing else is admitted which can throw any light upon the motives of the party; but that is carefully shut out which is the best test by far of their nature, though certainly only an unilateral test, inasmuch as there must always be guilt, if there is falsehood, though truth does not of necessity prove innocence. Nay, the defendant cannot even now be allowed to urge the truth in mitigation of punishment after conviction; as if there were the same criminality in publishing that a man had been tried and sentenced to the gallows for forgery, who was so sentenced, and that an innocent individual had been sent thither, who never had been tried or even suspected of the offence a case which lately occurred within my own experience. Another test, of a still more important kind, is excluded by a very injudicious refinement of our law, its repugnance to try collateral issues. A foul charge is brought against a man, of rape, or some yet more horrid offence, and the liberty of cross-examining the prosecutor or his witness, whom I will assume to be his fellow conspirator, is, in a most important particular, restrained. The defendant's counsel may address the witness thus ""Were you not examined on different occasions, at four or five several sessions, when you sought, by your testimony to convict as many different individuals of an offence similar to that which you now accuse this prisoner of committing, and were not all those persons whom you so prosecuted acquitted? Did not the Court reprimand you for prevarication, nay, order a bill for perjury to be preferred against you?"" True, the Council is at liberty to put questions like these; but what, if the witness answers, as in all probability he will, be the fact how it may ""No""? The prisoner cannot give evidence in contradiction of the wretch's assertion, at least the practice goes the full length of this. But at any rate it is quite clear law that, if the witness is asked, ""Have you not yourself been guilty, repeatedly, of this very crime which you now wish to fasten on the prisoner?"" and he should reply, as doubtless he will, ""No,"" the prisoner is not allowed to adduce evidence of the fact, because, forsooth, the Court cannot try collateral issues,"" unless the record of a  221 conviction is produced. Nay, I have known judges, though on this they differ, who would not suffer the prosecutrix in a case of rape to be asked, if she had not led an unchaste life before, because a common whore may be ravished, as if the probability of the event were the same in all cases, a mere nothing to the question under consideration. Furthermore, I ask, why should any class of persons be excluded from giving evidence in criminal cases on account of their religious opinions, notwithstanding their testimony is admissible in cases of a civil nature? A quaker is precluded by his religion from taking an oath; his affirmation is received in civil, but rejected in criminal cases. I was once employed, with two of my learned friends, to defend a man, prosecuted by the Attorney-General, for a misdemeanour. We had a very worthy and learned physician, by whose testimony we expected to rebut the charge; but it turned out, when he came to the witness-box, that he was a quaker; of course he would not swear, and equally of course he could not affirm. Our client, also of course, was convicted. This is bad every way; it is bad, for that it suffers guilt to escape; it is bad for that it suffers innocence to be destroyed. The quakers, it is true, desire not to see a change, because, being averse to capital punishments, they do not wish their testimony to be used in capital cases; but they forget that their evidence may be the only means of saving an innocent person from the very punishment of death to which they object, and that, rather than help to hang the guilty a punishment they dislike, they are allowing the innocent to suffer by the self-same punishment. There is, in my opinion, no reason for excluding any individual, be he of what religion, sect, or persuasion he may, from giving testimony in cases of every kind, provided he believes in the existence of a God, and a state of future rewards and punishments; and is not openly infamous by sentence of a court. I have already, in speaking of competence of evidence, said somewhat of presumptions; but there is a class of presumptions which has found its way into the practice of all Courts, and ought, in my opinion, to be carefully excluded; I mean presumptions affecting the weight of evidence tending to withdraw the attention of the Court from the facts of the 222 particular case, and to produce a decision founded upon some kind of average taken from other cases, and because taken at a former period, of course excluding the case in hand. It has thus become almost a rule of law, that perjury can only be proved by two witnesses, or perhaps, by one witness and the defendant's handwriting. Why may not other circumstances exist, quite as sufficient to cast the balance against the oath of the accused, and give credit to his accuser? This presumption goes in favour of the defendant; but there is another, by which he is often, I am convinced, improperly convicted; I mean the rule that an accomplice is entitled to credit in all particulars, provided he be confirmed in some. I once, many years ago, endeavoured to contend for a limitation of this rule, when the late Chief Baron Thompson presided in the Special Commission at York. I maintained that it was necessary to give the confirmation upon some fact which could not be true, consistently with the defendant's guiltlessness. It is certain, however, that the law knows no such qualification, and the Judge whom I have named, than whom no greater criminal lawyer, or more humane and upright man ever existed, ruled, with his reverend brethren, against me; and seventeen men suffered death, some of whom were convicted on the testimony of accomplices. I do not exactly recollect, whether the confirmation was as slight as would barely satisfy the exigency of the rule; but I am very sure, that instances frequently occur in which the story of an accomplice leads to a conviction, while all the witnesses of credit swear only to slight or wholly equivocal circumstances. It is a somewhat similar anomaly in the rules of evidence, that the Court always takes upon itself to construe written instruments, of whatever kind, as if their sense must be matter of law, while the weight of all parol evidence is as invariably left to the Jury. Why should the assistance of the Jury be wholly rejected in this province? It is another and a kindred rule, that where, on the face of a writing, there is an apparent, or as the lawyers term it, a patent ambiguity, no other evidence can be I allowed to explain it; where the ambiguity is latent, or raised by extrinsic evidence, I there other evidence may be adduced to remove it. This principle has been laid down by high legal authority for it is  223 first clearly stated by Lord Chancellor Bacon but I am much disposed to question its correctness. Coupled with the other rule, which excludes the Jury from construing written evidence, it tends greatly to narrow and darken the path to a correct decision. This naturally leads us to examine a little how the Courts have exercised this, which they have thus claimed as their exclusive province and we are thus conducted to a variety of other presumptions respecting evidence, which have been received and acted upon, so as now to have become rules of interpretation, and parcels of the law of the land. With much unfeigned respect for the authority of the great names whose sanction this large branch of our jurispudence has enjoyed, and with much admiration of the ingenuity and astuteness which it has called forth, I must be permitted to say, that, considering the paramount object of all law its use as a rule of life for the people, no part of our system is less entitled to praise. It should seem that one obvious principle of construction would be to take words in their plain ordinary sense, and always to construe them alike, in whatever import they might be used. Only let lawyers consider what a mass of technical niceties and real difficulties this would get rid of; only let them reflect on the consequence of following the very opposite course. Why should the same words be differently construed in a will and in a deed? Why do words, which in one species of instrument give an estate in fee, convey only a life-interest in the other? Why should the last words employed in a will overrule the earlier ones, and not in a deed, on the vain refinement that these express a man's latest intention as if the whole taken together were not his latter will as much as the whole taken together are his deed? But even in wills, where we affect most to follow the intent, so nice is the construction, so technical has it become through many decisions of the courts, and so imperfect consequently is the knowledge generally possessed by people on the subject, that a man cannot well be more in the dark on the subject of the distribution of his property after his will has taken effect, by his being naturally dead, than he is at the very moment of making it. In fact, most men, while disposing, or fancy they are 224 disposing of their property, do not, in the least, know what they are doing. An unlearned individual thinks he is giving a life-estate when he is giving an estate in fee, or in tail, and vice versa. The testator, J. Williams, whose will gave rise to the case of Perrin v. Blake, where the rule in Shelley's case was extended, little dreamt that the first taker was to have the absolute control over the property, when he directed him to take an estate for his life and no longer. Observe, I am far from complaining of that any more than Shelley's case. The refinement which unites the particular estate with the remainder, in issue of the first taker, is little more than an application of the simplest rule in law, that an estate to a man and his heirs (or, which is the same thing, to a man for life, with remainder to his heirs,) is a fee simple. But the law should prevent the niceties arising from following out its principles, from misleading those who are ignorant of those principles. By freeing it from such technicalities you would, I think, rather elevate the study of jurisprudence and raise its professors; I am certain you would benefit all the rest of the King's subjects. It is hardly to be conceived how much, as matters at present stand, a man who makes his will is in the dark as to its final operation. Thus the creditor who appoints his debtor executor to his will, is considered as having granted a release of the debt: what ordinary person would think he had done so? The very same reason that induced him to lend the money, friendship, blood, confidence, and to count upon its faithful repayment, naturally leads him to appoint the borrower his executor. I have known it happen in this way fifty times in the country, yet the debt is gone at law; and equity will only relieve by holding the executor a trustee, where there are other debts and no free fund to pay them, or some words showing an intention to revive the debt words not very likely to be used by a person who never dreamt of its being extinguished. Then suppose a man has made two wills of the same date, and cancels one of them; it is held that, in certain circumstances, he cancels the other. If one of the wills is at his banker's, the law raises a strong presumption that by cancelling his own copy he intended to cancel that, when the probability is, that he cancels because he is aware there is a duplicate, and does not wish to have the  225 first lying about his house. When both copies are in his own possession, the law does not entertain so strong a suspicion of the intention to annul the will, by cancelling one. Still, however, the presumption is raised; an individual may be thus held to have died intestate, who never entertained any intention of the kind: and his property may pass away from those near relatives or favoured friends to whom he destined it, and be given to his hundred-and-fiftieth cousin, or, for default of legitimate relatives, may be vested in the Crown. But it is not thus only that a person may revoke his will without knowing it, and die intestate while he thinks he is disposing of his property. He may happen to do so by the very act he performed with a view of confirming his testament and establishing his purpose. A recovery suffered, unless the will be republished, destroys it entirely, upon the nicety, quite consistent, I admit, with strict legal principle, that a new estate is taken back, different from that which was in the testator when he devised. This happens frequently to frustrate the plain intent of parties. Lately in the Court of King's-bench we had an instance of large property in this immediate neighbourhood, going any where rather than according to its owner's intention, because a recovery had been suffered; and a recovery, suffered for the express purpose of confirming the will, deprived Lord Erskine of a large estate in Derbyshire. So a conveyance, which divests an estate though but for an instant, to serve a use, with the intention of immediately taking back the former uses, which are accordingly taken back, totally revokes the will made before.* Nay no less a judge than Lord Hardwicke has expressly laid it down that where a man, supposing he had only an estate tail on which a devise could not operate, suffers a recovery for the express purpose of taking back a fee in order that his will may be good, it is thereby revoked.+ The most notable part of these excessive refinements is, that they all proceed upon the act being evidence of a presumed intention, when no man can doubt that either there was no such intention, or one of the very opposite description. Thus if I devise lands to a person, and afterwards, for the same reason of favour towards him, by way of making * Cro. Jac. 49. 4 Ves. jun. 656. + Goodtitle v. Otway, 7 T. R. 399. 226 him more secure, give him a lease in the same, to commence after my death, he being perhaps tenant for years under me at the time, the will is gone.* It thus happens that, in the very act of his life, in which it is most important that a man should see clearly what he is about, and most likely that he should have no professional assistance, he is often wholly in the dark as to the effect of what he is doing. Were I in want of further illustration for this matter, I might go at once to the doctrine of Powers, and show how the thing intended to be permitted is often prevented, and vice versa, by the view which Courts have taken of what is and what is not a good execution, and which renders it unsafe to give an opinion upon any power, the very words of which have not received a judicial construction. I might go to the still greater niceties in the rules respecting the construction of contingent and executory Uses, a chapter of our law, signalized by the utmost learning and ingenuity of those who have treated it. I might, indeed, at once ask what foundation in reason, or even in analogy, there is for holding that a purpose should be accomplished, by way of executory devise, which cannot be effected by way of contingent remainder; as the mounting a fee upon a fee, or directing a contingent use to spring and enure without any particular estate to support it; if, indeed, I ought not rather to ask why there should be any necessity in either case for a freehold interest to support an after-taken contingent estate, and why there should be any horror of mounting a fee upon a fee, an idea so familiar to the feodists in the sister kingdom, that their strict settlements (always made by deed, for they, having their niceties like ourselves, though of another sort, allow no devise of real property at all) consist of a succession of fees under restraints specifically presented as to alienation and incumbrances. But I will satisfy myself with what has been said on this head, and suggest, as the obvious corollary, a remedy for the great bulk of the mischief I complain of, the * Sparrow v. Hardcastle, ib. in not. Nor is it necessary to change the estate, in order to operate a revocation, e. g. a feoffment by tenant in fee to another to his use and that of his heirs, 3 Ves. 7, and an ineffectual recovery by tenant for life, (reversion in fee, disposed of by will) 2 Ves, jun. 430.  227 laying down by the Legislature of certain formulae, couched in plain language, and of an import recognized by written law. You give this help to Justices, to prevent convictions and orders being set aside for technical error. Why not give it to men often less learned than they, for disposing of their property? Why not say, that whoever would give a fee, should use these words; an estate for life these; that whoever would cloathe the takers of that estate with certain powers, may do it thus and so forth not stating that such are the only words which shall effect the same purpose, but that at any rate those shall. By such a plan, and by retrenching some refinements which the fund is ample enough to spare, in rules of construction, I know that much curious learning will be brushed away; but I also know that the law will be rendered accessible to those whose rights it is to govern, and that the lay people will gain far more than the learned lose. Thus much for amending the rules of construction. But for the general establishment of sound rules of evidence, I should recommend, first of all, an introduction of one rule as to the manner of examining witnesses, instead of trying issues of fact in one court by written depositions and in another by viva voce examination, (whereby the same will may be, and sometimes has been supported in Doctors' Commons, upon personalty, which a Court of Nisi Prius has afterwards set aside altogether) in one court by affidavit, by sworn answers to unsworn bills, by yet more clumsy and ineffectual examination, on written interrogatories previously drawn; in another only by parole examination. I would have all matter-of-fact, wheresoever disputed, tried by a jury. For sifting the truth by such a trial, I would admit all records between the parties or their proxies, and all instruments and writings of every kind, of the parties against whom they are used; so much the law now permits; but I would let in whatever documents, written by persons deceased, appear plainly to have been made, without any view to manufacturing evidence. In a word, excluding inferior evidence where better can be obtained, and, therefore, all hearsay absolutely, I would admit whatever could not be deemed to have been done with a view to the fabrication of proof, by the knowledge that such would be receivable. Allowing objections from interest in the event as well as in the 228 question, to weigh only in estimating a witness's credit, I would make no man incompetent to give evidence in any cause, civil or criminal, who was not either an unbeliever in God and a future state, or convicted of some infamous offence. In examining the witnesses, I would suffer a witness to be contradicted as to matters directly affecting his credit, and on which he had been questioned; * and in the event of a witness turning out hostile to the party calling him, there can be no sound reason why, subject to the Judge's discretion, he should not be treated as adverse, and even contradicted, without which the latitude at present given by some Judges, only amounts to a power of putting leading questions. Of nonsuits for variance, and other technical defects, I have already spoken. The law respecting Limitations comes as an appendix to the chapter of Evidence. No branch of our jurisprudence is more imperfect, and hardly any more demands revision. Why should there be no statutory limitation of a bond or other specialty? For want of it the Courts have adopted a sort of rule, founded upon presumption of payment, that where the instrument is twenty, or even eighteen years old, sometimes less, (so accurate is the rule,) and no interest has been paid, or other acknowledgment made of the subsistence of the debt, it may be assumed to be satisfied; that the instrument is cancelled they cannot presume, for there it is, seal and all, staring them in the face; but there being no receipt or discharge, and the bond being in the obligee's hand, is surely quite enough to rebut any presumption of payment so that the Courts have really made a law, though a bad and uncertain one, to meet the case. It would be far better to fix at once a period of ten years, after which no action should be maintainable upon specialties. But even in cases where we have a statute of limitation there is hardly any vestige left of the relief which it was intended to afford, owing to the labours of the Courts in finding means of evading its beneficial operation, it was plainly meant as an act of peace and quiet. My noble friend (Lord Plunkett) who presides in *This is really only a nominal relaxation of the rule in Spencely v. de Willet; the spirit of that rule is preserved, for the credit of the witness is not a collateral issue.  229 the Court of Common Pleas of the sister kingdom, once said, with his usual felicity of expression, that Time is armed with his scythe to destroy the evidence on which titles rest, but the lawgiver makes him move with healing on his wings to stay the ravages of his weapon. To thwart the design of the Legislature the Courts have been setting up their rules of presumption. At one time they seemed really to hold that any thing, even the simplest expressions, would take a debt out of the statute of limitations; for instance, if a defendant had said ""I have paid the debt,"" he was taken as admitting it, unless he could prove payment. Again, if he said ""I owe you nothing,"" the assertion was taken as an acknowledgment; and he was also required to prove an acquittance of the plaintiff's claim. The reply ""Six years have expired"" was equally dangerous, though it was only saying out of court what the statute itself allowed him to say in pleading. In fact, so deeply did Lord Erskine feel the difficulties which encompassed the defendant under these efforts of judicial acuteness, that he said the only safe course a defendant could take when his adversary sent a fishing witness to him was to knock him down, for though he might be proceeded against for the assault, he retained the benefit of the statute, as regarded the debt. Although of late the current of decisions (as it is pleasantly termed) has set in more in an opposite direction, there is still abundant room for a provision to give this wholesome law effect. The means are obvious; let nothing but an acknowledgment in writing take any debt out of the statute. In a word, prop the main, pillar of security against stale and unjust demands, the Statute of Limitations, by a beam from that other bulwark against perjury, the Statute of Frauds. The law of Limitation seems to require alteration, not additional enforcement, in the case of real actions. The period for a writ of right is thirty or sixty years, according as the demandant counts on his own or his ancestor's seisin. But in a formedon, which is often termed, as in truth it is, the tenant in tail's writ of right, it is no more than twenty years. The difference surely is founded on no sound reason, and ought to be done away, by a law fixing thirty years as the period of limitation in all real actions, and removing the important difference in construction 230 which Sir T. Plomer's late decision has made from the different expressions used in the statute of Henry VIII. and James I., so as, in many cases of property under lease, to deprive the demandant of his remedy altogether. But in one case there is no limitation at all, I mean that of Church rights. Why should there not be? I admit that the same period ought not to be adopted respecting the Church as the nullum tempus act prescribes for the Crown; but I confess I do not see the necessity of leaving the law as it now stands, and exempting ecclesiastical claims from all restriction whatever. What is the consequence? It was admirably pointed out by a most learned Judge (Mr. B. Wood), in one of the ablest tracts ever written, no less distinguished by closeness of legal argument than by that pure and concise diction peculiar to him. A composition real may have been made between a clergyman and his parishioners, at any time since the restraining statute of Elizabeth; for 200 years the land may have been possessed by the parson, and yet if the original agreement should have been lost, as it is almost sure to be amongst farmers, though no tithe has been taken during all that time, there would be no bar by limitation in the event of the clergyman claiming the tithes; so that it could not be ascertained by whom the land had been given, and the land could not be restored for want of claimants; indeed there are cases in which the clergyman thus retains the land originally given for the composition, and has his tithes paid to boot. I would say, then, with Mr. Burke, take not away from the Church its power of being useful, but deprive her only of that which makes her odious. The reign of Richard I. is the period up to which all rights as against churchmen must be carried; nay even against lay impropriators, to whose case none of the reasons for favouring ecclesiastical claims apply. Yet that period becomes daily more remote and more inapproachable by evidence. Does not every principle of justice require, that lay titles to tithe should be put on the footing of other property, and that for Church rights, properly so called, a period of limitation should be affixed, longer than for other rights, to prevent collusion between incumbents and tithe-payers, and combined, if necessary, with the number of two or three vacancies?  231 vi. The course of my observations has now brought me to the Trial of Issues, raised by the Pleadings, on the Process, and investigated by means of the Evidence. On this branch of the subject I have little to offer. The principles are plain which should guide us, and they are not so widely departed from in practice as to require any great change. Each party should be allowed fully to propound his case in the way most advantageous to himself. All new matter advanced by the one should receive an answer from the other; each should be encouraged and not hindered to bring forward whatever evidence may tend to throw light upon the matter in question. Our practice, at least in modern times, departs a good deal from these principles, but is very easily restored to them. We compel the plaintiff to explain his case, and comment upon it before his witnesses are examined: unless his adversary produces evidence, he has no means of observing, even upon his own case, after he has proved, or attempted to prove it. Hence his opening must be often very general, for fear of his evidence falling short; and hence he often labours under a prejudice from that short opening, which a little explanation might remove. Counsel are every day obliged to open their cases in the dark; experience teaches us in some degree the difference between what is set down and what will be actually sworn; so that a young advocate will give a very different statement on the same brief from a practised one no great compliment to our method of trying causes, in which as little as possible should depend on the forensic skill of practitioners; but even the most experienced are constantly deceived by their instructions; the cause may change its aspect, especially in the cross-examination of their witnesses; and they have no opportunity of correcting the error and preventing the result from turning on a matter wholly foreign to its merits the discretion of those who prepared the brief unless the other party gives evidence. Now, for this very reason, and to gain by his adversary's failure, (a failure not necessarily connected with merits,) he will avoid doing so; he will also avoid it generally, to prevent his own remarks from being answered. Hence much important evidence is every day shut out, by this play of counsel to avoid giving a reply, which the plaintiff should have, whether the defendant calls witnesses or no. Here, 232 as in other things, the system is far from uniform: in Appeal cases, both before the House of Lords and the Privy Council, there is a reply, as of course; and in the Committees of this House, as well as in trials for high treason, there is an opportunity given to each party of commenting on his case, after it has been presented in evidence, by a summing up. The practice is the same in the Ecclesiastical Courts, and the Delegates. I understand that a summing up, or speaking to evidence, as they call it, is allowed in Ireland; in Scotland both prosecutor and prisoner are heard on the evidence after it has been adduced, the want of an explanatory opening being in part supplied by the debate upon the relevancy of the indictment. I believe in civil cases they have adopted our modern practice, instead of the older method to which the Irish adhere. Before leaving this head I may be allowed to suggest an amendment of a minor kind, but of very considerable importance, It would be advantageous to have a Sworn short-hand Writer in every Nisi Prius case. Those who attend our Courts of Nisi Prius are aware how sorely the Judge is hampered, and his attention diverted from more important considerations, by being obliged to take such full notes of the evidence. This practice is necessary, because the only record of the facts of the case is to be found in his notes. Now, the judge is often a slow writer, and, in this respect, men differ so much, that one judge will try three or four causes while another will dispose of only one, and one will impede a cross-examination so as to render it quite ineffectual, while another will never interrupt it at all. It happens likewise that a judge may be an incorrect taker of notes, which not unfrequently leads him to an incorrect decision, at least to an incorrect report of the case when a new trial is moved for. No judges ever write short-hand, and for no other reason, than that their notes may have to be read by another, if the record comes not out of their own court. My honourable friend, the member for Durham, (Mr. M. A. Taylor,) whose suggestions have ever been found most beneficial to judicial proceedings, introduced the great improvement of short-hand writers in our committees, and abridged the delay and expense of those inquiries incalculably. I  233 would have them, if introduced into our courts, take full notes of the proceedings; at the same time I would not hold their notes as conclusive; they might be subject to the correction of the judge on any important matter misapprehended; for he, of course, would take his own note, but only of the principal and the more delicate things, likely to be misunderstood by one ignorant of law. He would soon find where he could trust the short-hand writer and where not; he would be relieved from much labour, merely mechanical, and left free to regard all the bearings of the case, and to take a commanding view of it, so as to bring on a more speedy decision of its merits. But, Sir, I cannot leave the subject of trial without saying somewhat of the general principles regulating Real Actions, sinning as they do against all sense and justice. In other cases the plaintiff begins the attack, and on him it rests to prove his case, to stand or fall by his proof; but, in a Writ of Right, the person in possession fifty-nine years and three-quarters must, according to the existing law, expose his title, pedigree, and all to his opponent, who can lie by and pick holes in them to his own advantage, without being even asked on what ground he relies, until his adversary has proved his case; a great benefit, whatever be his ground; for the Jury must give the property to somebody, and it is likely that the party in possession having failed, the claimant may get in. In Ejectment, though the plaintiff may have held possession for almost twenty years previous to the cause of action arising, yet, if he has been out of possession for one single day, it is incumbent on him to prove his title, and the defendant is not bound to budge if he fail. In this case, too, the plaintiff must pay costs if he fails, even though the person he attacks has been but a day in possession, and cannot have been in above twenty years. In the real action, where the possession may have been near sixty years, the claimant pays not one shilling of costs, for making you prove your title, though he fail entirely in impeaching it. Nor let it be imagined that these evils never occur; I have seen them fully exemplified twice within the last eighteen months. We had a writ of right at York in the spring of 1826, to try the title to many thousands a year, On the eve of the trial we, for the demandant, discovered 234 a defect in the proof of taking the esplees, and were forced to withdraw the record. It came down for trial at the next assizes, when we were astonished to find the defect we had reckoned upon in the tenant's title removed, and on asking where the document produced had been discovered, we were told that it had come to light on searching the Bishop's chancery, at Salisbury, some weeks after the Spring assizes, in which he would have been defeated had we gone to trial. Only see by what an accident the possession of this large estate was saved. Our client was defeated on the freehold as not being the eldest son; he afterwards brought a plaint, in the nature of a real action, in the Court of Lambeth, as youngest son, for the copyhold, which was descendible by borough English. He again failed; but, of course, he paid costs in neither suit. vii. The Trial being had and the Judgment pronounced, there follows the Execution; and in this most important branch of the law, which may be emphatically called the law of Debtor and Creditor, I feel perfectly justified in declaring our system to be the very worst in Europe, departing the most widely from the principles which ought to regulate a creditor's recourse against his debtor. Those principles are abundantly plain. In proportion as before the debt has been proved, the person and property of the party charged should be free from all process not necessary to prevent evasion; so after judgment, ought the utmost latitude be given to obtain satisfaction from all the defendant's property whatever land, goods, money, and debts for to himself they no longer belong. To allow any distinction between one kind of property and another seems the height of injustice. No consistent reasoner can maintain the propriety of exempting land more than chattels; no honest debtor can claim the privilege which he waived when he contracted the debt. In case of a person deceased, all kinds of debts and all creditors should come in equally upon an insolvent estate; and preference only be given in the case of mortgage or other lien. The chattel itself sued for should be returned, and damages only given where it has been lost. The person of the debtor should not be taken in execution unless there is either a wilful concealment of property, or there has been criminal or grossly imprudent conduct in contracting the debt; or the two objects  235 should be kept carefully distinct, of what is done to satisfy the creditor, and what is done to punish the debtor. Lastly, the former should obtain his satisfaction as speedily as may be, and as conveniently for the latter as is consistent with the creditor's security. How widely does our law depart from these obvious and natural principles, by dint of refinements, blunders, and openly avowed injustice! First of all, there are only two actions for recovery of chattels, in which we are expected to give the thing specifically sued for, replevin and detinue; yet in neither can the party compel a delivery in kind; and detinue is besides useless, because the defendant may wage his law. In all others the claim is avowedly for damages only. A horse is taken from me, and I sue for it; yet I only obtain damages for its detention; but suppose I want the horse and not the money, the law will not aid me: nay, it will give me not a farthing in consideration of being thus compelled to part with it; I only receive what it would fetch in the market if I chose to sell it. Equity and common law differ widely here; the former always performs in specie; the latter looks to damages only; unless, indeed, where it is inconsistent with itself, as in the summary process to make parties perform awards, and attornies and other officers of the courts deliver up deeds, and pay monies, by means of attachment. But all these are comparatively trifling, and rather absurd in principle, than of extensive injury in practice. What is quite substantial, and of hourly occurrence, is the frustration of a creditor after he has obtained judgment, and taken out execution. His debtor has a landed estate; if it be copyhold, the creditor cannot touch it in any way whatever; if it be freehold, he may take half by elegit, and receive the rents and profits, but no more in the lifetime of his debtor. The debt for which he has received judgment may be such that the rent of the land will not even keep down the interest; still he can take nothing more; he cannot turn the land into money; so that, when a man sues for a thing detained unlawfully, you give him money which he does not ask; and when he asks for money by suing for a debt, you give him land which he does not want. But if his debtor dies before judgment can be obtained, unless the debt is on bond, he has no remedy at all against any kind of real property of any tenure; nay, though 236 his money borrowed on note or bill, has been laid out in buying land, the debtor's heir takes that land wholly discharged of the debt. But not only is land thus sacred from all effectual process of creditors, unless the debtor be a trader; the great bulk of most men's personal property is equally beyond reach of the law. Stock in the public funds debts due in any manner of way nay, bank notes, and even money are alike protected. I may owe a hundred thousand pounds in any way, and judgment may have passed against me over and over again; if I have privilege of parliament, live in a furnished house or hotel, and use hired carriages and horses, I may have an income from stock or money lent, of twenty thousand a-year, and defy the utmost efforts of the law; or if I have not privilege, I may live abroad, or within the rules (as some actually do,) and laugh at all the courts and all the creditors in the country. So absurd are our rules in this respect, that if I have borrowed a thousand pounds, and the creditor has obtained judgment, the Sheriff's officer appointed to levy upon my personalty may come into my room and take a table or a desk; but if he sees the identical thousand pounds lying there he must leave it he touches it at his peril: ""For this quaint reason,"" says Lord Mansfield, ""because money cannot be sold, and you are required by the writ to take your debt out of the produce of goods sold."" It is true, that great judge, whose merits as a lawyer were never underrated, except by persons jealous of his superior fame, or ignorant of the law, (among whom was a writer much admired in his day, but of very questionable purity, and certainly no lawyer,) leaned to a contrary construction of the creditor's powers, and might have somewhat irregularly introduced it. But Lord Ellenborough afterwards denounced such attempts as perilous innovations on the fundamental principles of our jurisprudence; and the law is now settled on this point. And here, Sir, let me step aside to ask who is the innovator, he who would adhere to such rules in violation of the manifest intent and spirit of our old law, or he who would re-adjust them so as to give it effect? In ancient times there were none of those masses of property in existence, which are exempt from legal process. When the law, therefore, said ""Let all a man's goods and  237 chattels be amenable for his debts,"" it meant to include his whole personalty at the least. Things have now changed in the progress of society; trade has grown up; credit has followed in its train; money, formerly only used as counters, has become abundant; banker's accounts have been invented; paper currency and the funds have been created. Three-fourths of the debtor's personalty, perhaps nine-tenths, now consist of stock, money, and credit; and the rule of law which leaves those out of all execution, no longer can mean as before ""Let all his personalty be liable"" but let a tenth-part of it only be taken. Can there be a greater change effected upon, or greater violence done to, the old law itself, than you do by affecting to preserve its letter? The great stream of time is perpetually flowing on; all things around us are in ceaseless motion; and we vainly imagine to preserve our relative position among them, by getting out of the current and standing stock still. The stately vessel we belong to glides down; our bark is attached to it; we might ""pursue the triumph, and partake the gale;"" but, worse than the fool who stands expecting the current to flow down and run out, we exclaim Stop the boat! and would tear it away to strand it, for the sake of preserving its connexion with the vessel. All the changes that are hourly and gently going on in spite of us, and all those which we ought to make, that violent severances of settled relations may not be effected, far from exciting-murmurs of discontent, ought to be gladly hailed as dispensations of a bountiful Providence, instead of filling us with a thoughtless and preposterous alarm. But the imperfect recourse against the debtor's estate, although the grand opprobrium of our law, is by no means its only vice: the unequal distribution, in case of Insolvency, is scarcely a less notable defect. Only traders, or those who voluntarily take the benefit of the act, are compelled, when insolvent, to make an impartial division of their property. All others may easily, and with impunity, pay one creditor twenty shillings in the pound, and the others sixpence or nothing. So, when a man dies insolvent, his representatives may, by acknowledging judgments, secure one creditor his full payment at the expense of all the rest. Then, lax and impotent as the law is against property, wide as are its loop holes for fraud 238 and extravagance to escape by, utterly powerless as is its grasp to seize the great bulk of the debtor's possessions, against his useless person it is equally powerful and unrelenting. The argument used is, that the concealed property may thus be wrung from him: the principle, however, of the law, and on which all its provisions are built, is, that the seizure of the body works a satisfaction of the claim; and this satisfaction is given alike in all cases alike where there is innocent misfortune, culpable extravagance, and guilty embezzlement. Surely, for all these evils the remedy is easy; it flows at once from the principles I set out with under this head. Let the whole of every man's property, real and personal his real, of what kind soever, copyhold, leasehold, freehold; his personal, of whatever nature, debts, money, stock, chattels be taken for the payment of all his debts equally, and in case of insolvency, let all be distributed rateably; let all he possesses be sifted, bolted from him unsparingly, until all his creditors are satisfied by payment or composition; but let his person only be taken when he conceals his goods, or has merited punishment by his extravagance or his crime. This line of distinction is already recognized by the practice of the Insolvent Courts; but the privilege of the Rule is inconsistent with every principle, and ought at once to be abrogated as soon as arrest on mesne process is abolished.* viii. The last subject which presents itself to our notice is the Appeal from judgments recovered. Here, as in every other branch of our jurisprudence, the Courts of Law and of Equity proceed on opposite principles, though dealing with the same matter. In the former, you can only appeal on matter of law appearing upon the face of the record, or added to it by bill of exceptions, and never in any case before final judgment. In the latter, you can appeal from any interlocutory order as well as from the final decree, and upon all matter of fact as well as of law. So it is in the Ecclesiastical Courts, where a grievance (or complaint upon interlocutory matter) is as much the subject of appellate jurisdiction as the appeal from the final sentence; and * This arrest, the end of which, it is to be hoped, fast approaches, was not generally given by the common law. The capias ad respondendum is given in debt and detinue by West. 2 (13 Ed, 1.) cap. 11, in case only so late as 19 H. 7. c. 9.  239 the Court above sits on all the facts as well as on the law. The principal evil of Courts of Error, is the stay of execution which they effect, thereby giving the losing party in possession an interest in prosecuting groundless appeals. The Bill of the Right Hon. Gentleman (Mr. Peel) being a partial measure, while it intended to remedy this evil, has rather increased it; because another more costly mode of obtaining the same delay being left open, the parties by defending actions in themselves without defence, avail themselves of it, to the enormous multiplication of frivolous defences. The true remedy I take to be this. Let the party who obtains a judgment be so far presumed right as to get instant possession or execution, upon giving ample security for restitution should the sentence be reversed. This is the rule in the Cape and other of our Colonies; in the Cape, two sureties each in double the amount, are required. It would also be an excellent modification of this principle, to vest in judges the discretion of ordering the execution to be levied by instalments, upon reasonable security being given. Hurried seizures, and sales for next to nothing, would thus be avoided; as would the destruction of many valuable concerns, to the ruin of the debtor and the loss of the creditor also. The reasonable delay thus safely granted would further tend to prevent groundless appeals and frivolous defences, for mere dilatory purposes. The details of this measure would be easily arranged; I am sure that it well merits inquiry, if I shall obtain a Commission. I have now followed the proceedings in our Courts through their whole course; and it will be observed, that I have said little or nothing of Costs an important subject; perhaps, taken in all its bearings, the most important of any; but which has so far been disposed of, in its principal relation, by the discussion of whatever tends to shorten litigation. A great, perhaps the greatest, evil of our system, as at present constituted, is the excess of the costs which a party succeeding is obliged to pay, over and above what he can re cover from his antagonist. This is so certain and so considerable, that a man shall in vain ask me to recommend him either to bring forward a rightful claim, or to resist an unjust demand for any such sum as twenty, or even thirty pounds at least, upon, a calculation of his interest, I 240 should presently declare to him, he had much better say nothing in the one case, and pay the money a second time in the other, even if he had a stamped receipt in his pocket, provided his adversary were a rich and oppressive man, resolved to take all the advantages the law gives him. I have here before me some samples of taxed bills of costs, taken quite at random, and far from being peculiar cases in any one respect. There is one of 428l., made out by a very respectable attorney, and from which the Master deducted 202l.; of this sum, 147l. were taken off, which had been paid for bringing witnesses. In this other, amounting to 217l., 76l. were taxed off; and in a third of 63l., there were nearly 15l. disallowed; it was an undefended cause, to recover 50l.: had the defendant been obstinate and oppressively inclined, he would have made the extra costs a good deal more than the whole debt, although the suit was in the Exchequer, where the taxation is known to be more liberal. We had lately in the King's-bench, a bill of above 100l. to recover 19l., and, probably of that 100l. not above 60l. would be allowed. As things now stand, a part of this master evil is inevitable; for if practitioners were sure of receiving all their bills, they would run up a heavy charge wherever they knew the case to be a clear one. But as the fundamental principle for which I contend is, to alter no part of the law by itself, or without considering all the other parts, there can be no difficulty, consistently with this doctrine, to enlarge the allowance of costs as soon as other amendments have prevented the abuse of litigation by professional men. Some erroneous rules of taxation may, even in a partial or insulated reform, be altered. Whatever is fairly allowed as between attorney and client, should be allowed between party and party, except only such needless charges as have been ordered expressly by the client himself. There can surely be no reason for disallowing, as a general rule, all consultations, often absolutely necessary for the conduct of a cause, generally more beneficial than much that is allowed; nor can it be right, that so little of the expense of bringing evidence should be given, and that the cost of preparing the case by inquiries, journies, &c, should be refused altogether. The necessary consequence of not suffering an attorney to charge what he ought to receive for certain things,  241 is that he is driven to do a number of needless things; which he knows are always allowed as a matter of course, and the expense is thus increased to the client far beyond the mere gain which the attorney derives from it. I have a great doubt whether benefit would not result from leaving the costs more in the discretion of the Court which tries a cause than they now are: in equity, they are always so in the fullest extent; at law, almost all is fixed by statute. Sir, in casting an eye over the wide field which we have been surveying, I trust the House will perceive that, although I have, for the most part, arranged my observations under the different stages through which causes are carried in our superior courts, I have yet been enabled to discuss the greater and by much the more important parts of our municipal jurisprudence. Indeed, with the exception of Commercial law, I am not aware of having left any branch untouched that seemed to require amendment. I stated, in the outset, the reason why that formed no immediate part of my plan. A great portion of it is common to all trading countries, the law-merchant, and is extremely well adapted to its purpose, being of comparatively modern growth, and framed according to the exigencies of commerce. Some other parts, however, are exceedingly defective. It would be difficult to point out greater uncertainty or more caprice in any branch of the system than are to be found in the law of Partnership. A man can hardly tell whether he is a partner or not; being a partner, the extent of his liability is scarcely less difficult to ascertain; and he will often find it in vain to consult his lawyer on these important matters.* The distribution of estates under the Bankrupt law is likewise capable of very great improvement. After all that was lately done in arranging and simplifying this code, it re- * The execution of judgments on partnership property is a remarkable example. The Sheriff must sell an undivided share, say a moiety of the whole: and the purchaser becomes tenant in common with the solvent partner, who may find the East India Company or Government his co-tenant, and be still liable to account to the other partner for his share of the profits; because the very effect of the execution which has let in so disagreeable a co-tenant of the stock will naturally be, to avoid a-going to prison (the only involuntary act of bankruptcy), and thus prevent a dissolution of the partnership. 242 mains full of contradictions, and the source of innumerable frauds and endless litigation. But into these things I abstain from entering. I must, however, once more press upon the attention of the House, the necessity of taking a general view of the whole system in whatever inquiries may be instituted. Partial legislation on such a subject is pregnant with mischief. Timid men, but still more blind than they are timid, recommend taking a single branch at a time, and imagine that they are consulting the safety of the mass. It is the very reverse of safe. In the body of the law all the members are closely connected; you cannot touch one without affecting the rest; and if your eye is confined to the one you deal with, you cannot tell what others may be injured, and how. Even a manifest imperfection may not be removed without great risk, when it is not in some wholly insulated part; for it oftentimes happens that, by long use, a defect has given rise to some new arrangement extending far beyond itself, and not to be disturbed with impunity. The topical reformer, who confines his care to one flaw, may thus do as much injury as a surgeon who should set himself about violently reducing a luxation of long standing, where nature had partially remedied the evil by forming a false joint, or should cut away some visceral excrescence in which a new system of circulation and other action was going on. Depend upon it, the general reformation of such a mechanism as our law is not only the most effectual, but the only safe course. This, in truth, alone deserves the name of either a rational or a temperate reform. Then, what ground can there be for taking alarm at the course I recommend of amendment, and proceeding by careful, but general inquiry? It is, indeed, nothing new, even of late years, in this country. We appointed a Commission to investigate the whole administration of justice in Scotland; and it ended in altering the constitution of the Courts, and introducing a new mode of trying causes. Yet Scotland, to say nothing of the treaty of Union, so often set up as a bulwark against all change, might urge some very powerful reasons for upholding her ancient system, which we in England should vainly seek to parallel. She might hold up her Statute-book in three small pocket volumes, the whole fruit of as many centuries of legislation, while your table bends beneath  243 the laws of a single reign and of your whole jurisprudence, it may be said as of the Roman before Justinian, that it would overload many camels. But I do not merely cite, against alarms or scruples, that bold, and wise, and safe measure of Lord Grenville; older authority, and in the Courts of Westminster, are with me. I will rely on Lord Hale, whose celebrated Treatise ""Of the Amendment of the Law,"" (far less studied, I fear, by our jurisconsults, than that of Fortescue*), well exposes the folly of such fears, with their origin. ""By long use and custom (says he) men especially that are aged, and have been long educated to the profession and practice of the law, contract a kind of superstitious veneration of it beyond what is just and reasonable. They tenaciously and rigorously maintain those very forms and proceedings, and practices, which, though possibly at first they were seasonable and useful, yet by the very change of matters they become not only useless and impertinent, but burthensome and inconvenient, and prejudicial to the common justice and the common good of mankind; not considering the forms and prescripts of laws were not introduced for their own sakes, but for the use of public justice; and therefore, when they become insipid, useless, impertinent, and possibly derogatory to the end, they may and must be removed."" Such is the language of Sir M. Hale. After Lord Coke and Littleton himself, there is no higher authority in the law than Shepherd, the author of the ""Touchstone,"" who, in another of his works, called ""England's Balm, or Proposals by way of Grievance and Remedy, &c, towards the Regulation of the Law and better Administration of Justice,"" reminds his legal brethren, that ""taking away the abuse of the law will establish the use of the law stabilit usum qui tollit abusum and that rooting up the tares will not destroy the wheat+."" If the House require further authorities upon this point, I can refer them to one of the ablest and most instructive books published of late years, that of Mr. Parkes, a * De Laudibus Legum Angliae. + There is certainly a notion of Mr. Justice Doddridge being the author of this excellent book, or at least standing in the same relation to it as that C. B. Gilbert does to Bacon's Ab.; for the works cited in it make it impossible he should have written it all. 244 respectable Solicitor in Warwickshire, who, in giving the history of the Court of Chancery, has collected most of the authorities upon the subject of Legal Reform. But our predecessors, members of this House in the seventeenth century, an age fruitful of great improvements, most of which were retained in more quiet times, undertook the amendment of the Law systematically, and with a spirit and a wisdom every way worthy of so great a work. In 1654, a Commission was formed partly of the House, partly of learned strangers. At the head of the former, I find my Honourable Friend the Solicitor General's less learned and more martial predecessor, called in the Journals Lord General Cromwell. But in front of the latter stands ""Sir Matthew Hale,"" afterwards the Great Chief Justice, whose name is ever cited amongst the most venerable supporters of our Civil and our Religious Establishment. With them were joined all the great Jurisconsults and Statesmen of that illustrious age. They sat for five years, and proposed a number of the most important and general reforms. I will read the titles of a few Acts, the draughts of which the Commissioners prepared:   1. For taking away Fines upon Bills, Declarations, and Original Writs. 2. For taking away Common Recoveries, and the unnecessary Charges of Fines, and to pass and charge Lands entailed as Lands in Fee-simple. 3. For ascertaining of Arbitrary Fines upon Descent and Alienation of Copyholds of Inheritance. 4. For the more speedy recovery of Rents. 5. For the better regulating of Pleaders and their Fees. 6. For the more speedy and easy recovery of Debts and Damages not exceeding the sum of Four Pounds. 7. For the further declaration and prevention of Fraudulent Contracts and Conveyances. 8. Against the Sale of Offices. 9. For the recovery of Debts owing by Corporations. 10. To make Debts assignable. 11. To prevent solicitation of Judges, Bribery, Extortion, Charge of Motions, and for restriction of Pleaders. 12. An Act for all County Registers, Will, and Administrators; and for preventing Inconvenience, Delay, Charge, and Irregularity, in Chancery and Com-  245 mon Law (as well in Common Pleas as criminal and capital Causes). 13. Acts for settling County Judicatures, Guardians of Orphans, Courts of Appeal, County Treasurers, and Workhouses, with Tables of Fees and Short Forms of declaration. 14. An Act to allow Witnesses to be sworn for prisoners.  The House is aware that till much later in our history, by the great wisdom, justice, and humanity of our ancestors, it was provided, that the witnesses for a defendant should not deliver their testimony upon oath; until the time of Queen Anne, the prosecutor only was allowed to prove his case, by sworn evidence; and the communication of the same right to the defendant, may be looked upon by some as a rude invasion of the ancient system, and a cruel departure from the perfections of the olden time. This is not the only measure prepared by that celebrated Commission which has been since adopted, as the House will see by the enumeration I have given.* But steps were taken immediately after the Restoration, for prosecuting its plans more systematically. A Committee was appointed by this House to examine the state of the Law and its practice; Sergeant Maynard and other eminent lawyers were members of it. From their numbers, fifty-one, I presume they subdivided themselves, for the convenience of inquiring separately into different branches of the subject. Upon their reports several Bills were brought in for the general reform of the Law; but in tracing their progress through the House, the prorogation appears to have come before any of them were passed. A long interval has elapsed of various fortune, and filled with vast events, but marked, from age to age, by a steady course of improvement, when we are again called to the grand work of surveying and amending our Laws. For this task, it well becomes us to begird ourselves, as the honest representatives of the people. Dispatch and vigour are imperiously demanded; but that deliberation, too, must * Sir S. Romilly's valuable MSS. contain the exposition and discussion of many reforms in the law, written thirty years ago. More than one-half of his proposals have, of late years, been adopted by the legislature; a strong presumption in favour of his plans generally. 246 not be lost sight of, which so mighty a matter requires. When we shall have done the work, we may fairly challenge the utmost approval of our constituents; for in none other have they so deep a stake. In pursuing the course which I now invite you to enter upon, I avow that I look for the co-operation of the King's Government. And, on what are my hopes founded? Men gather not grapes from thorns, nor figs from thistles. But that the vine should no longer yield its wonted increase that the fig tree should refuse its natural fruit require a miracle to strike it with barrenness. There are in the present Ministry, men whose known liberal opinions have lately been anew proclaimed to the world, and pledges have been avouched for their influence upon the measures of the government. With them, others may not, upon all subjects, agree; upon this, I would fain hope there will be found little difference. But, be this as it may, whether I have the support of the Ministers or no to the House I look with confident expectation, that it will control them, and assist me; if I go too far, checking my progress if too fast, abating my speed but heartily and honestly helping me in the best and greatest work, which the hands of the law-giver can undertake. The course is clear before us; the race is glorious to run. You have the power of sending your name down through all times, illustrated by deeds of higher fame, and more useful import, than ever were done within these walls. You saw the greatest warrior of the age the conqueror of Italy the humbler of Germany the terror of the North account all his matchless victories poor, compared with the triumph you are now in a condition to win saw him contemn the fickleness of fortune, while, in despite of her, he could pronounce his memorable boast, ""I shall go down to posterity with the Code in my hand!"" You have vanquished him in the field; strive now to rival him in the sacred arts of peace! Outstrip him as a lawgiver, whom in arms you overcame! The glories of the regency will be eclipsed by the more solid and enduring splendour of the reign. The praise which fawning courtiers feigned for our Edwards and Harrys, the Justinians of their day, will be the just tribute of the wise and the good to that monarch under whose sway so mighty a  247 work shall be accomplished. Of a truth, sceptres are most chiefly to be envied for that they bestow the power of thus conquering and ruling thus. It was the boast of Augustus it formed part of the lustre in which the perfidies of his earlier years were lost that he found Rome of brick, and left it of marble; a praise not unworthy a great prince, and to which the present reign is not without claims. But how much nobler will be our Sovereign's boast, when he shall have it to say, that he found law dear, and left it cheap; found it a sealed book left it a living letter; found it the patrimony of the rich left it the inheritance of the poor; found it the two-edged sword of craft and oppression left it the staff of honesty and the shield of innocence! To me, much reflecting on these things, it has always seemed a worthier honour to be the instrument of making you bestir yourselves in this high matter, than to enjoy all that office can bestow office, of which the patronage would be an irksome incumbrance, the emoluments superfluous to one who had rather, with the rest of his industrious fellow-citizens, make his own hands minister to his wants; and as for the power supposed to follow it I have lived half a century, and I have seen that power and place may be severed. But one power I do prize: that of being the advocate of my countrymen here, and their fellow-labourer elsewhere, in those things which concern the best interests of mankind. That power, I know full well, no government can give no change take away! I move you, Sir, ""That an humble Address be presented to his Majesty, praying that he will graciously be pleased to issue a Commission for inquiring into the defects, occasioned by time and otherwise, in the Laws of this realm of England, as administered in the Courts of Common Law, and the remedies which may be expedient for the same."""	220.0	1828.0	1820	[('important', 'important',

94036	94036	S3V0019P0-01044	1833-07-18	CHURCH TEMPORALITES (IRELAND) BILL.]	The Bishop of Exeter		"The Bishop of Exeter said, he felt that there was no necessity for him to give any assurance to their Lordships that he rose on this occasion with no common degree of anxiety. Their Lordships had now under their consideration the most important subject that had come before the Legislature for years, nay, he might truly say, for centuries. So important were the subjects involved in this discussion, that the noble Baron who had just addressed their Lordships had stated, that he was prepared, from a mere sense of the necessity of the case, to read this Bill a second time, notwithstanding the many and strong objections which the noble Lord entertained, and had urged against it. He, however, acting on the most solemn grounds, though feeling considerable difficulty when he found an individual possessing the knowledge and experience of the noble Baron making such a statement, came forward to assert those principles which he felt it to be his duty to avow, in the face of that necessity to which the noble Baron thought it his duty to yield. Considering the feelings which operated on the mind of that noble person, it was impossible not to see, that in pursuing a different course, he incurred a most heavy responsibility, which, he was, however, content to bear. In discussing this question he felt it to be his imperative duty to cast aside all personal and temporary considerations, and to examine it on its abstract merits alone, because he believed, that the interests of the church of God and the interests of truth were at stake. 810 Some parts of the Rill imposed a restraint on their Lordships in dealing with it. There was, he might be permitted to observe, a right insisted on elsewhere a right not formally admitted by their Lord-ships, but never practically resisted by them that was, the right claimed by the House of Commons to consider and decide on certain subjects without the intervention of their Lordships. He alluded, of course, to the right which the other House claimed to regulate and apportion the amount of any tax that was to be imposed by the Legislature, and the exercise of that right was involved in the present Bill. He must, however, contend, that in this instance, the exercise of that right was in direct violation of the very principle on which the claim of the House of Commons to exercise it, was founded. For what was that principle? It was, that they, as the Representatives of the people, on whom the main burthen of the taxation must fall, had a right to impose the burthen. The principle was, that as the Commons of the realm bore the burthens, the Commons should impose them. In this instance, however, a very small part of the community, forming a very small portion of the constituents of the other House, and having in it no Representative of their own order, were alone subjected to the tax which the other House claimed the exclusive right to impose. It had, in fact, in this instance, acted in a manner at variance with its own principles. It had imposed a tax on the property of men who were not represented in the place where that tax was imposed. There was not one of their own body present to led with them or to act for them. In that House the clergy were represented. The Bishops were the guardians and protectors of their interests, and an opportunity ought to have been afforded them to give the imposition of this tax a full and deliberate consideration, before it had received the sanction of the House of Commons. Their Lordships, and the Representatives of the clergy, had now no other course to pursue, so far advanced was the Bill, than to reject, or accept it without modification. The very principle on which the other House of Parliament rested its claim rendered it proper and necessary that some means should have been adopted by which those who were to be taxed under this measure, should have been consulted. Such a course might easily have been found, if Ministers had thought fit to have adopted the principle. If they had proceeded by Reso-  811 lution, rather than by Bill, then their Lordships might have considered this tax in all its bearings, and they might have been enabled so to discuss this matter with the other House, either by way of conference, or in some other mode, as to secure the concurrence of all parties. If this had been done, they would have approached the question with far less of excited feeling with far less of acerbity and with far less danger of incurring that which all must wish to avoid the danger of incurring a collision with the other House. He was the more disposed to think that if they had come to the consideration of this subject by Resolution, they would have arrived at a conclusion in accordance with the wishes of all parties, because the noble Earl who had introduced the Bill with so much ability had explained its object to be, to effect the removal of a tax from the community which had led, much more than any other cause, to the disorders that prevailed in Ireland: and, at the same time, to ameliorate the situation of the Church itself, and to improve its revenues. Now, as all these points related to the Church, it was particularly fitting, for the reasons he had stated, nay, he held it to be essential, that the measure should have been, in the first instance, considered by the Representatives of the Church. Seeing that the Bill professed to be for the improvement of the Church, and for the better distribution of its revenues, he thought that opinion could be maintained on higher and still stronger grounds. The noble Earl had stated the objects of the Bill to be three: 1st, the abolition of the Vestry-cess; 2nd, the augmentation of small livings; and, 3rd, the building and repairing of churches. With respect to the Vestry-cess, he should find it necessary to trouble their Lordships at some length; but as to the other two objects, he might be permitted to say, that no class of men in this country felt a more warm interest in those most desirable measures, the augmentation of small livings, and the building and repairing of chapels, than the Bishops of the United Kingdom did. In considering this question, the Bishops had cast aside every feeling of self-interest for their order; they came to it wholly and solely with the wish, particularly at the present time, to secure for the country the services of a body of men who would adopt the best means for promoting the worship of God, and extending the truths of the Gospel. The noble Earl had last night, in an elabo- 812 rate display of figures, attempted to show that sufficient funds would be provided by the proposed alterations for meeting all the expenses incidental to the new arrangement. But, he was prepared to contend, that those funds would be devoured by the demand occasioned on account of the Vestry-cess. He would advert to the noble Earl's accounts, and, if he were wrong, the noble Earl could correct him. The noble Earl stated, that the items of charge would be Church-cess, 63,241l.; augmentation of livings under 200l., 46,500l.; building and repairing churches, 20,000l.; glebe-houses, 10,000l.: making a total of 139,741l. There would besides be 5,000l. a-year for the expense of three Commissioners (an item which the noble Earl had omitted); making a total of 144,741l. The sale of the perpetuities of Bishops' leases, however, would not, as the noble Earl had stated, produce 1,000,000l., but only 800,000l., supposing the sales to be readily effected. The mistake on this point had originated in the other House, where the noble Lord had forgotten to take into consideration the fine annually paid, which reduced the value of the perpetuity one-fifth. He was surprised that the noble Earl should have fallen into the same error. Instead, therefore, of producing 1,000,000l., the sale would at most only produce 800,000l., and that would not yield an interest of four per cent, but only an interest of three and one-third per cent, which would reduce the annual income from this source to 26,000l., speaking in round numbers, even if perpetuities of all the leases were purchased. There were also, it should be observed, 264,000l. to be set apart to meet certain charges that were now due; and he would venture to say, that the probability of those leases in perpetuity being purchased was so small, that if 264,000l. were realized by them, it was as much as any reasonable man could expect. That sum, certainly, must be deducted from the 800,000l. But, as he said, he believed, that the sale would not yield more than 264,000l., and, therefore, he asserted that the 40,000l. of the noble Earl ought to be altogether struck out of the account. Upon the supposition of the noble Earl, the sale would only yield 26,000l.; but as he saw no readiness to purchase, and there was a large sum to be provided for, he saw no probability of the sale yielding a farthing to dispose of. The next item to meet the expenses of the new arrangement, was the produce of the  813 Consolidated bishoprics, which was estimated by the noble Earl at 57,700l. But here the noble Earl had made a consider-able mistake; he had taken the gross instead of the nett amount of the revenue of the bishoprics, and the real produce was only 50,700l. The next item was the tax on the Bishops who remained, which was calculated at 4,600l., which might, probably, be correct. The next item was the tax upon incumbents, which amounted to 44,000l. But, it appeared, by a paper which had been laid before Parliament, that since the period of the date on which that calculation was made, a tax of fifteen per cent had been laid upon incumbents, to be paid to the landlords on account of tithes. The result was not a diminution of fifteen per cent, but to a much larger amount; so that no one could safely reckon the amount to be derived from this source at more than 24,000l. The next item was that of the repayments for fifteen years, 8,000l.; the immediate reduction of the Bishopric of Derry, 2,000l.; the future reduction of the same bishopric, 4,160l.; and the future reduction of Armagh, 4,500l. per annum. The conclusion he arrived at was, that the whole sum which could be reckoned on, amounted to 85,872l.; but all this part of the revenue was contingent, and depended on the lives of the incumbents. He would call their attention to the immediate sources of expense. A charge for Church-cess would be immediately incurred of 63,000l. per annum, together with the 5,000l. a-year for the Commissioners. To meet this, there was immediaately available only the revenue of the sec of Waterford, the payments for the see of Derry, and certain payments on account of clergymen, who held money from the First Fruits, to build churches, &c.; making in all only 16,000l. a-year. That was all which could be safely calculated on for the next fifteen years. Every year, therefore, they would incur a large debt; and, at the end of the first year alone, the amount would be no less than 47,000l, including the 5,000l. to the Commissioners. This debt would be annually increasing in the same proportion, except so far as the amount of the tax would be diminished; and the consequence would be, that, at the end of fifteen years, they would be upwards of half a million in debt, which would entail a charge of from 15,000l. to 18,000l. a-year on the country. The result would be, that all the funds pointed out by the noble Earl, and which he had considerably 814 overstated, would not He sufficient to provide even for the Vestry-cess; that would devour not only the tax laid on the clergy, but all the other fluids that had been enumerated. He should next take a view of the Bill itself. It appeared to him to be constructed on a very peculiar principle. To say that it was a delusion would be hard, for he did not think that it would delude any one. It was made up of a series of proposistions which would delude, if they were believed; the very title of the Bill showed that. It was called, ""An Act to alter and amend the laws relating to the Temporalities of the Church in Ireland."" Now, how did that title agree with the contents of the measure, which was in fact a Bill to transfer the payment of a certain lax from one part of the community to another. Now, let their Lordships suppose, that a Bill was introduced into that House, the title of which bore, that it was to alter and amend the laws relating to real property, and when they came to look at the Bill, they found that the intention of the Bill was to take off the legacy duty, and lay that duty upon lands, would they say that such a Bill was to amend the laws relating to real property? Yet such a Bill would be in strict analogy to the Bill before them; and if such a Bill were brought forward, he would venture to say, that their Lord-ships would object to it, as containing a false title. To proceed next to the pre-amble of the Bill, it said, ""Whereas it is expedient to make provision for the abolition of first fruits in Ireland, and the substitution of an annual tax in lieu thereof,"" Now, it appeared, that these first fruits did not amount to more than 300l. a-year, which was payable by a great number of persons; and he did think it extraordinary, that any body of men should arrive at the opinion, that it was expedient to do away an impost of that trifling amount, for the purpose of substituting a tax of 50,000l. or 60,000l. a-year. They had heard from the noble Earl, last night, a justification of the abolition of first fruits. The noble Earl had said, that first fruits were originally exacted by the Pope for temporal purposes, and that they had come down to Henry 8th, as subsequent head of the Church, and successor of the Pope, and that they had now come to the present Government as successors to Henry 8th. And now, it appeared, that the Legislature claimed the right of dealing with it in their turn, after the example of that just and moderate prince, whose conduct and  815 this might satisty their Lordships the nature of the measure was now held up us a precedent for them [Earl Grey had not drawn any such inference]. No; he drew that inference he did not charge the noble Earl with having drawn it; but such was the inference which he thought he was justified in drawing from the noble Earl's words. Now, what was the fact with respect to the origin of these first fruits? The Pope, as spiritual head of the Catholic church and, it should be remembered, that no king of England claimed to be the spiritual head of the English Church originally claimed a right to present to all benefices which had been held by persons who died at the see of Rome, and the persons so presented were required to pay to the Pope the first fruits of such preferments. This could not be contradicted by any noble Lord. The Pope, however, soon extended his claim to all livings, no matter where situated, or under what circumstances the presentation was made. The clergy were under the thrall of the spiritual head of the Church, and they succumbed to this demand. But was it universally acquiesced in? By no means; the Commons frequently remonstrated against it. The Commons' House of Parliament loudly exclaimed against the Pope's being allowed to devour the riches of this kingdom by with drawing the first fruits from it. So strong was the feeling on the subject, that Henry 8th himself did not at first lay claim to the first fruits, as connected with the Church. He claimed the tax merely because it was necessary that he should support the dignity of the King of this realm, and the temporal head of that Church. The noble Earl cried ""Hear, hear!"" He seemed to think that this was a complete precedent. Certainly it was no precedent could be more complete. But had such a claim been made, since the time of Henry 8th, by any Monarch of this country? Had any of them followed up the Act of Parliament by which these first fruits were granted? Had any one of them ever raised the valuation, though it was an express provision of the act that a new valuation might be made whenever the King pleased? They had been told last night of three different valuations which had been made in Ireland, in the reigns of Elizabeth, of James 1st., and of Charles 1st. Now, he asserted that this was a very great historical error No such new valuations ever took place. There were valuations in those 816 reigns, but they were valuations of livings that had not before been valued. They were not new valuations of livings that had previously been valued. The right reverend Prelate contended, that many acts of the Irish Parliament supported him in the view he took of this question, and particularly referred to one passed in the third Session, entitled, ""An Act for granting certain subsidies to the clergy of Ireland."" The same rule was followed in the succeeding reign, when an Act was passed granting eight subsidies to the Prelates of Ireland. In fact, from Henry 8th's time downwards but one system of valuation had been followed. The provisions of every statute passed since the time of Henry 8th, all tended to the same point. The measure then before the House was the first contrary instance upon record, and he hoped their Lordships would not follow, but reject, the precedent, as it deserved. He contended that the right to these first fruits had been vested in the clergy of the realm exclusively. The noble Earl had, however, founded his argument not only on ancient precedents, but on the practice in the present times. He stated, that in the bishopric of Durham, the property of the Church had been applied to Church purposes. In that case the revenues of the Dean and Chapter had been applied to the building a university. But what the right reverend Prelate, the Bishop of Durham, had justly stated was, that the revenues of the Chapter had been founded for the extension of sound learning, and that the Chapter, in appropriating the revenues to the university, had only followed the injunction. That was unquestionably no precedent for applying Church property to any but Church purposes. The noble Earl had likewise alluded to the duty demanded of the clergy in Ireland of keeping a teacher in the schools, or paying 40s towards his expense. Now, he begged their Lordships to observe, that that was a duty of a specific nature. The schoolmaster was paid by his scholars, but so badly, that it was hardly possible he could be supported from that source without some additional help, and as the clergyman was bound to sec that a school was kept in the parish, he was made to pay 40s. in order to ensure there being a schoolmaster. He submitted, therefore, that whether the measure was good or bad, it must stand on its own grounds, as he had shown, that there were no former precedents of the kind. The next part of the preamble  817 stated ""That it was expedient that all compulsory assessments by exclusive vestries should be abolished."" When he considered all the circumstances of the laying on of assessments by exclusive vestries in Ireland, and the spirit of discontent which it created, he was ready to assent to the proposition that those assessments should cease; but as the object for which those assessments were raised must be necessarily provided for according to the law of the land, this was a charge that ought to be laid upon the land. At present the charge was laid upon the occupiers. But as, whenever there is the proper relationship between the tenant and landlord, the burthen of the tax comes ultimately upon the landlord, this tax must be considered as strictly a tax upon the land. And it was highly expedient that the tax should be laid in the first place upon the occupier, especially in England; first, because that mode of levying it ensured economy; and, secondly, because it was the most easy mode of levying the tax. Yet, when the tax could not, from circumstances, be easily levied upon the occupier, then he was ready to admit that some other mode should be adopted, in order to levy it with greater facility. Still, however, the tax ought in equity to be levied upon the land. But by the Bill which he held in his hand the whole of this tax was taken entirely off the proprietor and tenant, and fixed upon the clergy. He would ask their Lordships if they were prepared to go to that extent? Was there any reason why they should go to such a length? He had expected that there was not one would have allowed himself to be relieved of this tax at the expense of that most useful and meritorious class of men, the clergy of Ireland a class, many of whom, he regretted to say, were now without a home to cover them. Such a change would be attended with the grossest injustice. And he did expect, that whatever might be the necessity of relieving the tenants of the tax, their Lordships would not take advantage of that necessity to thrust the burthen on themselves. For if anything could be more disgraceful than to be a party to so unjust a measure, it was to be a sharer in the profit derived from it. He never was more surprised than when he heard the statements made by two noble Marquesses last night. One of them had even made a kind of claim upon this tax, and that a tax upon men, many of whom, as he had already said, were without a home. He 818 was sure that the noble Marquess did not mean to avail himself of the opportunity. He had said, that he did not know that one of their Lordships would avail himself of this circumstance; but he was mistaken there was one noble Marquess, who was connected with the present Government, and on whom his bitterest enemy, if he had any such, would not throw the slightest imputation. But if he had understood right, the noble Marquess was unwilling to avail himself of that opportunity, that he did not approve of transferring the tax on the clergy, and that he wished it to be borne by the landlord. It also appeared from the evidence of Mr. Foster, given in 1819, that the noble Marquess, in instances where his tenants could not endure the Vestry-cess, ordered it to be paid at his own expense. That was an example which confirmed the views he had taken, and pointed out the parties on whom it was proper this charge should be laid. In speaking of the Protestant clergy of Ireland, he did not think it necessary for him to say much in their behalf to induce their Lordships to consider them with as much favour as existing circumstances would allow. Their conduct had always been highly praised, and he could adduce various testimony given before both Houses of Parliament to prove that it had been highly satisfactory. He would mention the testimony of Major Woodward, Inspector of Prisons in Ireland, with respect to the conduct of the Protestant clergy. That officer said, that were it not for the residence of the Protestant clergy in Ireland, every trace of civilization would have disappeared in that country. When such was the case, ought such men to be treated in the way the present Bill proposed to treat them? He was aware that charges had also been made against the Protestant clergy of Ireland. Dr. Doyle had stigmatized them as holy harpies devouring all the food of the land, without giving anything in return, and represented them as wallowing in affluence and luxury. He felt himself bound to state, that such was not the general feeling of the Catholics in Ireland. The Bishop of Limerick some years ago, in allusion to an attack on the Protestant Clergy, pointed to a petition from certain Roman Catholics that had been laid on their Lordships' Table, which petition prayed, that there might be Protestant clergymen sent among them. That was a decisive proof that all the Catholics did not think like Dr. Doyle. He  819 would also quote the testimony of another Catholic in favour of the Protestant clergy. The testimony he meant was that of Father O'Leary, who, in addressing himself to the Whiteboys of his time persons similar to the Whitefeet of the present day asked them with respect to tithes, ""What right they had to interfere with the revenues of the Protestant clergy?"" And moreover Father O'Leary told them, that ""it was more to their interest than they imagined, that the Protestant clergy should be maintained in their rights."" ""For many ages,"" continued the Holy Father, ""you have been destitute of protection; your land-lords have been your oppressors, and your own clergy could not protect you, for they were continually persecuted, and often sentenced to deportation, and even to death. You found protection at last, and you found it in the mild, benevolent, christian, character of the Protestant clergy."" This was written in 1787; and he would ask whether the Catholics would be benefited by curtailing the revenues of the Protestant clergy, and consequently limiting their sphere of charity? Would it not be better to transfer this charge from the poorer Catholics, and place it on the landlords? The charge would fall heavily on the Protestant clergy, but if it were placed on the landlords, it would almost be too minute for calculation; it would be to them a charge of less than live farthings in the pound. The rent (he spoke from good authority) of all the land in Ireland amounted to more than 12,000,000l. Now, one penny in the pound on that rent would come to 50,000l., and if one farthing more was added, they would get 62,500l., very nearly the amount of the Vestry-cess. The question then was, whether that sum should be transferred to the clergy, or whether the landlords should not be called upon to pay it, when it would amount to a tax of only five farthings in the pound on the rent. He was almost ashamed to delay their Lordships with those details, when the matter, even without this, was so evident. It would, however, be necessary for him to say a word or two on the resident Protestant clergy of Ireland. They peformed services that could not be paid for with money in fact, it was impossible to value their services. When resident in Ireland, even in their character of private gentlemen, they were found to be the greatest, nay, the sole benefactors of the poor. Where were the landlords of those poor? Many of them, he allowed, were in 820 that House discharging honourably their duty as Legislators, and doing all they could for the benefit of their tenants. But there were other landlords, he was sorry to say, and so must their Lordships be sorry to admit, who, instead of doing their duty in person towards their tenants, allowed others to perform the services which they themselves ought to perform. They were represented by others, instead of being on the spot, and defraying the costs of charity out of their own purses. But the clergy were the true source of relief, consolation, and protection, to the unhappy peasantry of Ireland; and he called upon their Lordships, in the name of that unhappy peasantry, not to diminish the clergy's means of doing good. The noble Earl who had introduced the measure to the House had made some strong remarks with respect to the influence of the assessment of the Vestry-cess, and had ascribed to the collection of that tax a great part of the agitation and disturbance which prevailed in Ireland. He hoped he had not shown any disposition to underrate the evils of the Vestry-cess as it affected the fields of the poor tenantry, the majority of whom, it must be borne in mind, were Roman Catholics, and who felt it galling to their feelings to be called upon to contribute to the support of another religion. While he was ready to admit that of late years a great degree of agitation had been caused by the existence of the cess, yet he could not admit that it was the principal, or even one of the principal causes, of the agitation which now existed. He would refer, in support of this proposition, to the report which had been presented to the other House of Parliament less than a year ago by a Select Committee appointed to inquire into the immediate causes of the then disturbed state of certain counties in Ireland, and into the sufficiency of the laws for suppressing outrages against the public peace. The Report commenced by stating, that numerous witnesses had been examined, and that evidence had supplied full information as to the causes which the Report then proceeded to state. And what were those causes."" After recommending the establishment of a night watch, in order to check and control nocturnal meetings in actual cases of Whiteboy conspiracies and crimes, the Report added, that the Committee, 'in making this suggestion to the House, would feel great reluctance in doing so, if they did not entertain a conviction that such remedial measures as may tend to remove the causes of crime,  821 would, at the same time be adopted. They are fully of opinion, that an increase in the rigour of the law could not alone restore peace to Ireland.' The Report proceeded to state, 'that although the Committee have not sufficient time to give an opinion on each of the several causes which have been stated in evidence to have occasioned the recent disturbances, there are one or two of them to which they bog to call the attention of the House. The removal of tenants from farms at the expiration of old leases is unquestionably a considerable cause of those disturbances, and the Committee have considered this subject with the view, if possible, of gelling rid of this source of evil; but the subject involves so many important considerations, such as the rights and duties of landlords, the obligations of tenants to fulfil the covenants of their leases, and the claims of tenants upon humane and indulgent treatment by their landlords, that the Committee have not been able to discover any plan by which the tenants removed may be altogether protected from being exposed to severe hardships. But at the same time, the Committee are of opinion, that a plan may be adopted which would go far to alleviate the distress too commonly experienced by the poorest class of landoccupiers in Ireland.' Their Lordships would perceive by this Report, that the main cause of the disturbances and agitation was the state of the relation between landlord and tenant in Ireland; and in addition two other causes were assigned. The first was the extent to which vagrancy and mendicity prevailed, and lastly, the immoderate use of spirituous liquors; but the Report was silent entirely upon the subject of the Vestry-cess, on account of which the noble Earl had called upon their Lordships to acquiesce in this Bill as a compensation for the recent suspension (he must admit a justified suspension) of the Constitution. Thus it appeared, that in August last, the Committee was unable to find any sufficient excitement to prevail on the subject of the Vestry-cess, to induce them to take the least notice of that impost in their Report. He had alluded to the evidence of Mr. Leslie Foster, contained in a former Report; but that gentleman had given also some evidence as to the effects of the Vestry-cess, and when asked whether it was regarded generally as a grievance, had said, that where it was not necessary to build new churches, the amount of cess was very 822 trifling something like one penny and a fraction per acre; but where it was necessary to build new churches, an additional rate was imposed, varying from 2d., 3d., and 4d. to 1s. per acre; and in the latter case, he thought it had excited dissatisfaction.' Mr. Leslie Foster then spoke of the generous conduct of the noble Marquess below, (then Marquess of Lans-down) in his character of landlord, to which he had just before referred; to which also other witnesses deposed. He would also beg to refer their Lordships to the evidence of another estimable witness, Colonel Curric, the agent of a noble Duke (the Duke of Devonshire) whom he did not see in his place. Colonel Currie expressed before the Committee his opinion to be, that if the Church-rate were paid by the landlord, it would remove all cause of complaint on the part of the tenants. He could not avoid regretting the absence of the noble Duke, because he thought it would be impossible for the noble Duke to deny the proposition of his own agent, namely, that the cess should be fixed upon the landlords. It was stated, on the best authorities, that not less than two-thirds of the whole landed property in Ireland was held by absentees, and this fact was an ingredient to be taken into account upon the present occasion. He must also quote another evidence on the subject of Vestry-cess, viz., Dr. Murray, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Dublin. Dr. Murray had, in his evidence, said, that if the Church-rates, instead of being made a charge upon the occupying tenants, were charged upon the landlords, he was induced to think it likely that dissatisfaction would cease. He (the Bishop of Exeter) would admit, that this evidence applied to the state of things existing in Ireland some years ago, but these admissions lost nothing by the lapse of time, but were equally valuable on the present occasion, for they admitted the point of right and justice. With the evidence, however, he had not yet done, for he would quote the testimony of Mr. O'Connell upon this topic. Mr. O'Connell was asked before a Committee of the House of Commons, whether, if Roman Catholics were admitted to the right of voting in vestries, it would not be found very difficult to pass any question relative to the building or repairing of churches, and he answered that he did not think that any fair course in this respect would be resisted. Mr. O'Connell then stated some case of an  823 Unfair burthen being imposed, but added, that he was convinced, in a fair case, such an object would not be resisted, for, in his opinion, where there were any Protestants, there ought to be a place of worship for them as convenient as possible. But Mr. O'Connell was neither the last witness nor the highest authority. He would refer to the Report of a Select Committee, appointed by the House of Commons in 1830, to inquire into the state of the poor in Ireland. The Committee said, that 'They have applied themselves to the collection of such a mass of facts as might enable the House hereafter to form correct opinions on the state of the poorer classes in Ireland, and the best means of improving their condition.' The Committee mentioned the injury that had been done by sudden transitions from one system to another. But what remedies did they propose, and what did they state about the abolition of Vestry-cess? They said that 'The Grand Jury taxes, or County-rates, which, from an annual sum of 470,106l. have, since the Union, augmented to upwards of 800,000l., now constitute the heaviest burthen to which the occupiers of land in Ireland are subject. In their effects on the general industry of the country, in opening access to markets, and facilitating agricultural improvement and commercial enterprise, the presentment laws are most important. They also exercise a powerful influence upon the moral habits of the people, upon the rate of wages, and the demand for labour. From these observations it must appear, that an inquiry into the condition of the poorer order in Ireland would be incomplete, if carried on, to the exclusion of the Grand Jury system.' Now the Vestry-cess did not amount to one-twelfth part of the above grievance. The Committee went on to say, that 'These taxes are imposed by the Grand Jurors, or principal landed proprietors; they are paid by the occupying tenants, in many cases the poorest classes of cottier peasantry; they are expended, to a certain extent, in roads and bridges, which frequently add a considerable value to the estates of the Grand Jurors and other inheritors of land; but the pecuniary means of completing these improvements are furnished by those who have a less direct and permanent interest in the soil. It is true, that these, like other burthens, cannot be altogether lost sight of by the tenant at the time that he takes his lease, but the extreme eagerness to 824 obtain possession of land renders such calculation but an insufficient protection; besides which, the rapidity with which this branch of taxation has augmented, and the various subjects to which it has been applied by subsequent laws, and which could not have been taken into consideration, make it quite impossible for either landlord or tenant to form any accurate estimate on the subject. In 1790, the Grand Jury rates of Limerick amounted to 7,422l.; in 1829, the same tax had reached 34,324l. Such augmentation was not accompanied by any proportionate rise in agricultural produce; nor could it have been in the contemplation of a lessee entering into a contract in 1790. Your Committee have no hesitation in expressing their decided opinion, that as a check upon expenditure, and a security for the rigid examination of accounts, in the execution of public works, the occupying tenant should, in the case of all future contracts, be relieved from the burthen of paying the entire county assessments; and that such assessments should, in the whole or in part, be imposed upon the landlords. It may be expected that this arrangement will render Grand Jurors more vigilant in preventing an undue increase of taxes, which will fall directly on themselves: and it will be their interest to have the public works executed with skill and with economy, in order to obviate the necessity of new and augmented expenditure for repairs. Under this alteration of system, the imposer will also be the payer of the tax, and the person who is permanently benefited by the work, will be compelled to furnish the means for its execution. The policy of making this change has been more than once rocommended to the consideration of Parliament.' The Committee concluded by saying, ""that no time should be lost in carrying this suggestion into practical operation."" Now, he apprehended, that he was not mistaken when he said, that three years since that Report was made had passed without that recommendation having been carried into effect. He understood, it was true, that a Bill bearing on this subject had been brought forward in another place. [Earl Grey: It is now on the Table of this House]. Be it so; yet it was undeniably true, that three years had elapsed without that recommendation being acted upon. The same Committee also recommended an Amendment of the Vestry Acts, which they stated as calling for revision and  825 reform. This revision took place under Mr. Goulbun's Bills, though it was omitted to provide, as had been recommended, by a statement in a schedule to those Bills, for the precise purposes for which the assessments should be raised and levied. Thus had it been contended in the House of Commons, so late as 1827, that on general principles the burthen of Church-rates should be imposed on the lessors rather than the tenants, and peculiarly so in Ireland. The general principles to which he alluded were the principles of equity and justice, because, as the majority of the population were dissentients from the Established Church, he would impose upon the landlords the duty and burthen of building and repairing Protestant places of worship. The same Report recommended a series of measures, with a view to relieve the distresses of Ireland, for the serious and early consideration of the Government and the Legislature. The 13th measure so recommended was a Bill to amend the laws relative to Vestries in Ireland, by defining the purposes for which parochial rates should be imposed and levied, and to relieve the occupying tenants from payment in case of future contracts. Their Lordships might now, perhaps, be curious to know how this Committee, from which these recommendations had emanated, had been constituted. It appeared, from the Journals of the House of Commons, that on the 11th of March, 1830, the Committee was appointed on the Motion of Mr. Spring Rice, who, as was usual, nominated the Members; and it consisted of Mr. Spring Rice, Sir John Newport, Lord Milton, Mr. Lamb, Sir Henry Parnell, then followed some other names, which he would not fatigue the House with repeating and afterwards came Lord Althorp, the noble Lord who had introduced the Bill in the other House, Mr. C. Grant, and Lord John Russell, all of whom were now Cabinet Ministers, and though acquiescing in this Report, had sent up the present Bill as a compensation for the suspension of the Constitution in Ireland. The next name was that of one not yet a member of the Cabinet, Mr. O'Connell; then came that of Lord Palmerston; and lastly, the name of the right hon. Gentleman who had taken upon himself the whole responsibility of this Bill, and claimed the lay patronage of it Mr. Stanley. Thus was the Committee composed of all the Cabinet Ministers in the other House, with the exception of the right hon. Baronet, the First Lord of the 826 Admiralty, and that Committee had agreed in saying, that the Vestry-cess ought to be imposed upon the landlords rather than the tenants. Were those noble Lords and right hon. Gentlemen so much the spoiled children of that fortune which had made them the Ministers of this country as to be able to throw aside one measure for the purpose of carrying something else? Such conduct was behaving like spoiled children, and he doubted whether their Lordships would acquiesce in such a course. It might be said, that in the Bill now before their Lordships other objects were contemplated besides the Vestry-cess, and for those so much was to be taken away from the Church. Those objects were the augmentation of small livings, and to secure the efficient performance of the service of the Church and its stability. Of these points he thought he had disposed, for he had shown, that there would be no funds for carrying any of these objects into effect; on the contrary, all the funds under the Bill were taken to supply the place of the Vestry-cess; but even supposing there might be a surplus, he must remind their Lordships, that a tax was to be imposed on the clergy. There was another source of revenue also looked to namely, the suppression of the bishoprics, which was thought necessary by the authors of the Bill, in order to supply the place of the Vestry-cess. It was commonly supposed, nay, had been often asserted, and was generally believed, that the property of the Bishops of Ireland was in fact property which had been transferred by Acts of Parliament from the Roman Catholic to the Protestant Bishops, and it was argued, therefore, that an Act of Parliament could again make the transfer. The fact, however, was, that no such transfer had ever been made, nor were there any such Acts of Parliament. In truth, when Henry 8th threw off his allegiance to the Pope, his example had been followed by almost all the prelates of that day, with the exception of some few whose memories he (the Bishop of Exeter) honoured as having sufficient principle to resist. The Archbishop of Armagh and some of his suffragans did so resist; but the majority of the Bishops did outwardly conform, and by their hypocrisy retained the possession of their sees; and how had they used them? They leased out their lands, and acted in such a way as tended to enrich themselves and relatives, while they impoverished the Reformed Church. This had been alluded  827 to by a reverend prelate, Bishop Jeremy Taylor, who said: 'The Popish bishops and priests seemed to conform, that keeping their bishoprics, they might enrich their kindred, and dilapidate the revenues of the Church; which, by pretended offices, false informations, fee-farms at contemptible rents, and ungodly alienations, were made as low as poverty itself, and unfit to minister to the needs of them that served the altar, or the noblest purposes of religion.' An ecclesiastical historian also complained, that at the time in question, the episcopal sees were so wasted, that they were utterly incapable of maintaining the Bishops appointed to them. That had been one of the chief causes of the unions of sees which then took place. In consequence of that, adopting a suggestion that had been made originally by Cranmer, Lord Strafford had a Commission issued for the purpose of devising means for making suitable provision for the maintenance of the Bishops in Ireland. The result of that Commission was, that a large portion of the lands in the north of Ireland, forfeited in the rebellions of Tyrone and others, was appropriated to the support of the Bishops there. Their Lordships were aware, that at that period the whole of the north of Ireland was forfeited to the Crown, which made the foundation of the great Protestant settlement of Ulster. It was on that occasion, that so many of the ancestors of noble Lords now sitting in that House received from their sovereign those vast properties which their descendants now held in the north of Ireland, and the Bishops of the province of Ulster were then also enriched from the same source. He was sure, therefore, that their Lordships would see, that the Bishops of Ulster had the same undoubted right to the property which they had derived from that source, as those noble Lords had to the property which they had in the same way obtained in the north of Ireland, and that, if their Lordships should be ill-advised enough to shake the opinion as to the right of property possessed by the Bishops there, they would not merely be sacrilegious plunderers of the property of the Church; they would be destroyers of their own property. Their Lordships were too wise as well as too honourable to do that. He did not believe, that their Lordships would be either. But it was not merely in the north of Ireland that the revenues of the Bishops were not derived from a property which had been transferred to them from the hands of the Roman 828 Catholic Bishops, but was property with which they had been endowed by a Protestant King. That endowment had also been extended to parts of the south of Ireland. It so happened, that by the 14th and 15th of Charles 2nd, which was well known as the Act of Settlement in Ireland, a large portion of the forfeited property was given to the Bishops in the southern part of Ireland. The right reverend Prelate having read the 102nd clause of the Act, to the effect he had stated, went on to say, that their Lordships would see, that the rights of those Bishops were placed exactly upon the same footing as the rights of those noble Lords who inherited property under that Act. It somewhat remarkably happened, that by the very preceding clause of this Act, the 101st, a large property in the south of Ireland was settled upon the ancestor of one of their Lordships. The right reverend Prelate here read the clause, which settled a large portion of the forfeited lands in the south of Ireland upon Sir William Petty, his heirs and successors. Their Lordships would perceive, therefore, that the noble Marquess (Marquess Lansdown) one of the authors of the present measure, and one of those who recommended the sequestration of the property of the Bishops in that part of the country, was himself possessed of lands there, the right to which rested upon exactly the same foundation as the right of the Bishops to their land. He would venture to advise that noble Marquess but no he would recall the word he would not presume to advise him what to do, but he would state what he himself would do were he placed under similar circumstances, and were this measure carried. He would, under such circumstances, sell all his property in that part of Ireland, being well assured, that the same fate which he himself had dealt to the property of the Bishops there would ultimately fall upon his own. Their Lordships would perhaps think seriously of the advice which he presumed to give them in this instance he begged pardon, he should not say advice he would say the suggestion which he presumed to make to them. It was upon no light or idle grounds that he arrived at the conclusion that such a proceeding would be, on the part of an Irish landed proprietor, an act of prudence. The great agitator of Ireland, Mr. O'Connell, had said, in a recent letter to one of his correspondents in Ireland, that that country did really possess a capacity for maintaining 19,000,000 of  829 persons, but it would never be found to maintain such a population until the proprietors of the soil should reside upon their estates. He stated further, that in the reign of Edward 3rd, there issued a prohibition against any person holding property both in England and in France, and that until something of the same sort was established with regard to England and Ireland, they could not hope for the prosperity of the latter country. It was his suggestion, that the proprietors of land in Ireland should be compelled to give their property there to their younger sons, or else to sell it; there being, ill his opinion, no other way of rescuing that property form destruction. That expression of opinion was uttered by the hon. and learned Gentleman in two days after the second reading of the present Bill in the other House of Parliament, and it was an opinion not to be disregarded. A year ago, Mr. O'Connell foretold, that tithes would be put an end to, and they had been destroyed accordingly. Of Churchcess he also prophecied the abolition, and that prophecy was likewise fulfilled, and why might not he that had denounced the payment of rents to absentees, in like manner, procure their abolition? First, he denounced tithes, and they were gone; secondly, he announced that he would, with a view to the improvement of Ireland, require, that an adequate revenue be provided for the purposes of public charities; thirdly, he proposed to make a provision for the Protestant clergy, which should correspond to the numbers of the flocks of which they had the care; fourthly, it was his intention to provide glebes and houses for the clergy of all persuasions; fifthly, he was to have a local and domestic legislature, with the view, as he alleged, of establishing upon a firm basis, the connection of the Crown and people of England with his own country. What further that Gentleman proposed, God only knew; but one thing at least was certain, that those things which he foretold had come to pass; and all he should then say was, that when that well-known individual began to talk of absentees, they had better look to their rents. He had hitherto spoken of the proposed diminution of the number of Bishops on the lowest possible ground that he could take up namely, the pecuniary ground; but there were other, and much graver considerations connected with that subject. The Bill which he held in his hand proceeded most modestly to say in its preamble: ""Whereas the number of Bishops in 830 Ireland may be conveniently diminished."" Conveniently! to whom? and for what? Could noble Lords and right hon. Gentlemen imagine that that could be conveniently done for the purpose of attaining that which most reflecting men regarded as utterly impossible to silence clamour, and gratify greedy faction, by yielding to its desires? It might be convenient to some to sacrifice the ancient Episcopacy of Ireland; but could it be convenient to the faithful counsellors of a Protestant King, which their Lordships were? could it be ""convenient"" to those who were entitled to give advice to their Sovereign, and who were bound to give him just and proper advice, to advise that Sovereign, who had sworn in the most solemn manner to maintain to the utmost of his power the Protestant religion as by law established, to preserve to all and every Bishop his existing rights and privileges, and to maintain inviolate the settlement of the Protestant Church in Ireland? could it be ""convenient,"" he repeated, to the hereditary advisers of such a Sovereign to join with those who had recommended him to give his assent to a measure that went to suppress nearly half the episcopacy of Ireland? The noble Earl had given them several reasons for adopting this measure. One of his strongest was to be found in the disparity to be observed, taking the superficies of the two countries into account, between the number of Bishops in England and in Ireland. There were twenty-two Bishops in Ireland, and twenty-six in England, and he believed the proportion which the superficies of the two countries bore to each other was as eighteen to thirty. It was certainly true, that there was a great deference between the episcopacy in the two countries, but might it not arise from the number of Bishops in this he number of Bishops being too small in England, rather than from the number being too large in Ireland? [a laugh.] Noble Lords near him might laugh at that supposition, but it was not one wholly destitute of authority. The noble Earl had certainly told them, that he had never heard it complained of, that the number of Bishops was too small in England; and that assertion of the noble Earl had greatly surprised him, for he had often heard, as well as read, complaints on that subject. At the Reformation steps were taken to augment the number of Bishops in this country; and some of the grounds on which Henry 8th recommended the abolition of the monasteries was, that their revenues might be  831 appropriated to the purposes of endowing new bishoprics. He proposed to endow sixteen new bishoprics, but he finally endowed only six. One of those new sees, the see of Westminster, in consequence of the prodigality of an apostate incumbent, shortly after fell pack again to the see of London, and it was on that occasion that a common proverb, now so well known, had its origin. The small portion of the property of the see of Westminster that was left was then given towards the defraying the expenses attendant on the repairing of St. Paul's Cathedral, and the giving of it to that purpose caused the saying of ""robing Peter to pay Paul."" If Henry 8th, on the occasion in question, had followed the advice then given to him by a man whose advice he sometimes followed. Archbishop Cranmer, he would have endowed sixteen new bishoprics in England; and if that had been done, instead of there being twenty-six, there would now have been thirty-seven Bishops in England. It was remarkable that in that case the proportion of the number of Bishops in England to the number of Bishops in Ireland would exactly tally with the respective proportion of the superficies of the two countries, with the excess of a fraction in favour of the Irish establishment, thirty-seven being the same proportion nearly to twenty-two, as twenty-six was to eighteen. The Church of Ireland, in that case, would have conformed to the standard which was recommended for England, supposing that the views of the Reformers with regard to the increase of the number of Bishops in England had been carried into effect. The noble Earl had also derived what he considered a strong argument, from the disparity between the number of incumbents under the superintendence of individual Bishops in Ireland and Bishops in England. In another place, too, he found that a noble Lord, who had the management of this measure there, had stated in his speech on introducing it (according to those sources of information to which their Lordships had access for the purpose of knowing what passed in that place), that he was determined to remove from the Church of Ireland the scandal of having so many Bishops with such small sees, and such still smaller congregations in the Churches. The noble Lord might spare himself that trouble. If this measure should not now pass, the noble Lord would have only in his leisure hours to refer to the pages of the New Testament, and there he would find that many Bishops were; ap- 832 pointed with much smaller sees committed to their superintendence than were to be found in Ireland. The noble Lord might see from that book, that the episcopacy established in Ireland was, in point of numbers, not extraordinarily large, and that there was nothing scandalous in the number of Irish Bishops, but he need not go beyond Ireland itself to justify the Church Establishment. The total number of Protestant clergy in Ireland was 2,300 or 2,400; and the number of Catholic priests under the superintendence of a similar number of Bi-shops, was (parish priests and curates together) only about 2,000. It was plain, therefore, that the same number of Catholic Bishops in Ireland had fewer incumbents to look after than the Protestant Bishops. Another argument of the noble Earl was as to the small number of the laity under the care of the Bishops in Ireland. But it should be observed, that the duty of a Bishop, as regarded the laity, was not confined to the imposition of hands in confirmation, but that his duty extended to the spiritual condition of all persons in his diocess, whether they belonged to his persuasion or not. The very circumstance of there being a vast Roman Catholic population in their dioceses, imposed heavier duties on the Irish Prelates than if all the population were Protestant. It was the duty of a Bishop to attend to the spiritual wants of all those persons who were the proper objects of his cure; and in the instance of persons, like the Catholics, who were unfortunately estranged from his communion, it was his especial duty to endeavour to win them, by all fair and fitting means, over to it. That was what rendered the duties of Bishops so heavy in such a country as Ireland, and that those duties had been adequately performed, was, he was happy to say, quite notorious. He would not offer his own testimony on such a point, but he had no objection to give their Lordships the authority of a clergyman of distinguished ability. The right reverend Prelate here read an extract from a pamphlet written by Dr. Newland, which had been called forth, he said, by an attack made on the Irish Church by a noble Lord, and was styled an apology for the Church of Ireland. The writer stated, that the duties performed by the Bishops in Ireland were in some instances extremely onerous, ingrossing the Bishops' whole time. He mentioned one instance where a Bishop was Continually employed from seven to eight hours every day in the dis-  833 charge of his duties. The right reverend Prelate added, that that Bishop would by this measure have another and additional diocess given to him to superintend. He then referred to the evidence given before the Commons' Committee by the Rev. H. Cooke, moderator of the synod of Ulster, to show that the number of Protestants in Ireland were greatly underrated, and that efforts were made, by telling the clergymen when newly appointed, that there were no Protestants in their parish to prevent them doing their duty. He thought, therefore, that no argument could be founded on the number of Protestants in Ireland for reducing the number of Bishops because that number was not known, and the smaller it was the more did it increase the labour of the Bishops. He was ashamed of occupying so much of their Lordships' time with these details, but he ventured to think that the importance of the subject would plead his excuse. In addition to what he had already stated, another consideration remained, which could not but be regarded with the deepest concern in coming to a determination on the present measure. What, he asked, would and must be the feelings both of Protestants and Roman Catholics in Ireland, if the Legislature should think fit to pass that Bill? Was it possible that the Protestant religion should be regarded by all parties otherwise than as having lost the countenance and favour of the Legislature? Would it not appear that their Lordships no longer regarded the Established Church as an object worthy of respect and support? Let it be borne in mind that the feelings of Roman Catholics were now very different from what they were wont to be. That class of persons exhibited a port, and assumed a tone, of defiance such as were wholly unknown amongst them a few years ago. The Roman Catholic ""Church"" was now spoken of, although no long period had elapsed since its heads were content to describe themselves as ""Prelates of the Roman Catholic communion in Ireland."" The Roman Catholic Bishops so designated themselves when they approached the throne to return thanks to the father of his present Majesty for a measure of kindness and liberality, which might be considered as involving a complete tolerance of persons of that persuasion. But all that was now very much changed, and not only was the Roman Catholic religion described as ""the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland;"" But Dr. Doyle spoke of it as"" the Church"" in 834 Ireland, and of the Protestant Bishops as being no Bishops at all, or Bishops merely in name. A work by Dr. Doyle, which was used as a class-book in the study of canon law in the college of Maynooth (a seminary maintained at the expense of a Protestant State) was dedicated to whom did their Lordships think? to ""the Most Reverend Father in God Patrick Curtis, Archbishop of Armagh, and Primate of all Ireland."" A class book on the science of logic, also used in the same seminary, spoke of the illustrious Bishop Berkley as ""in Hibernia pseudo episcopus."" Here were sufficient evidences of assumption and denunciation on the part of the Roman Catholics. In proof, if further proof were necessary, of the dangerous spirit and con duct of the Roman Catholic priesthood, he should quote the evidence of James Napper, Esq., who was examined last year before the Commons' Committee on the state of Ireland. Mr. Napper was a gentleman of what was called liberal politics, and had suggested various excuses for the priests, yet he was finally compelled to admit that some of them had exceeded their duty, and that their conduct generally was such as to promote a very great degree of excitement and agitation amongst the people. But he would at once read an extract from Mr. Napper's evidence ""You have stated in detail what may appear to you a palliation, or in some degree an excuse, for the con duct the priests latterly have pursued, but you have not stated the conduct of the Roman Catholic priests in your neighbourhood? In my answer to the question I have endeavoured to take their conduct with regard to their own personal interests, and the personal interests of their flocks, in the country. With regard to their conduct, either as good men or good politicians, I am ready to make any observation or answer that in any way may be wished; perhaps I mistook the object of the question. The question was with reference to the peace of the country generally? I certainly consider that the Roman Catholic priests, some of them, have exceeded what I should conceive was their duty as priests, and have taken a line of politics which I do not think has tended to their own respectability, and has certainly excited the minds of the people. Upon the whole, has their conduct, according to your view, tended more to promote or lead to the disturbance of the peace of the country, upon a fair view of their conduct? I think their conduct generally has  835 tended to promote a very great degree of excitement and agitation. How long since have you observed that in your neighbourhood? It existed in some degree when I first came into the country. Has it increased very much of late? Very much. Within what time? I should say since Catholic Emancipation was granted. Do you think that since then the priests have taken a more active part in politics than they had done before? Decidedly. Do you think that has led to the increase of the excitement yon have described? Certainly."" So much for the conduct of the Roman Catholic clergy of late years conduct, the important bearing of which on the present measure must be evident to the House. That measure would encourage those hopes of ascendancy to which the Roman Catholics looked forward, and which was indeed the ultimate end and object of all their schemes and contrivances. A parish priest, the reverend John Burke, of Castle Pollard, had adopted measures which had produced an extraordinary degree of excitement in his parish. Even from the altar, where, according to the principles of his creed, he must believe his God to be corporeally present, was this individual in the habit of denouncing to the hostility of an excited people all the gentry of the neighbourhood, particularly those concerned in the management of the estate of a noble Duke opposite (Buckingham). In consequence of these denunciations, the life of the noble Duke's agent was attempted, but he providentially escaped Mr. Burke's sermons were so inflammatory, that it became necessary to report his conduct to the Government. By a very proper regulation, an officer attended the chapel in company with the Roman Catholic soldiers, who wished to perform their religious duties there. Ensign Matson was the gentleman who attended; and after having mentioned Ensign Matson to Mr. Burke, he was asked by the Committee, 'Do you recollect, in his presence, on the first Sunday he went in charge of the soldiers, your having made allusion to the Protestants of Ireland in words to this effect  ""Boys, the tottering fabric of the heretics is falling around us, while the Catholic religion is rising in glory every day; Ireland was once Catholic, boys, it will, and it shall, be Catholic again?"" The word ""boys"" I did not use, I said, ""the tottering fabric of heresy was falling around us, while the Catholic religion was rising in glory,"" undoubtedly. On the 836 next Sunday, when that gentleman was on duty, do you recollect words to the following effect having been made use of in the chapel ""Boys, I shall want you to attend here half an hour after mass, to inform you of what took place at the petty Sessions, saving your presence, last Wednesday?"" Yes. ""We shall follow that up, and see if the police of Ireland are to trample on the people?"" I believe I did. I did not use the word ""boys.""' This temper and disposition was not confined to the Roman Catholic priests, it extended to the members of the hierarchy. The right reverend Prelate proceeded to quote from the Ballina Impartial, and from a private communication, in which it was stated, that Dr. M'Hale, Roman Catholic Coadjutor Bishop of Killala, had recently preached a most extraordinary and violent sermon, abusing the Church, and anticipating its approaching destruction. This effusion was described as being calculated to inflame the Worst passions of the people. It attacked the Government, the magistracy, and the constabulary, and enjoined union amongst the Roman Catholics, promising, that if they adopted that recommendation, they would be relieved from the constables within three months, and have every tiling their own way. Dr. M'Hale rejoiced greatly at, the destruction of the Church, and at the proposed reduction of the Bishops. At the commencement of this tirade, the military were very properly ordered out of the chapel and marched to their barracks, but the police were suffered to remain, a circumstance that was noticed as blamable in the newspapers, which gave an account of the transaction. He declined stating publicly the name of his informant, who was one of the first gentlemen in the county; but he had no objection to place the letter he had received in the hands of the Secretary for the Home Department. If this Bill took effect, Dr. M'Hale Would be the only bishop of Killala, for the Protestant bishopric of that name would be incorporated with another see. Dr. M'Hale had referred to the reduction of the Protestant Bishops, who having been appointed by the Crown and Parliament might, in his opinion, be fairly dispossessed by the same authority; but he argued that the Roman Catholic Bishops, not being appointed by any such power, could not be dispossessed in like manner. In fact, Dr. M'Hale must have been extremely well acquainted with the provisions of this Bill, which was the first instrument ever laid before mankind  837 by which any human power dared to do that that was here attempted; namely, to make a man be a Bishop by its own act, whether that man had accepted, or was willing to accept, the charge or not. To his brethren who might be disposed to vote for the second reading of this Bill, if any such there were upon that right reverend Bench, he suggested the importance of considering that the direct tendency of the measure was to make men who refused to accede to it, and bad petitioned against it, Bishops of certain dioceses, whether they would or not. He asked his brethren upon what principles of Christian doctrine or discipline was that to be endured? He denied their Lordships' right he denied their power to do this. He denied the power of any human authority whatever, to force a man to be a Bishop against his will. He was not at at all surprised that this should move the mirth of noble Lords; it being quite natural that they should indulge in laughter in relation to a matter which they had already treated with so much levity. He repeated, that the Legislature had no right or power to compel the Bishop of A to be also Bishop of B. The Bill said, that ""the Archbishops or Bishops named should, at the times mentioned, become, by virtue of this Act, and without further grant, installation, or ceremony whatsoever, Bishops respectively of the bishoprics also named."" The bishopric of Waterford was now vacant, and the Archbishop of Cashel, who had petitioned against the Bill, was to be obliged, in spite of his disinclination, to undertake, in addition to the archbishopric of Cashel and Emly, the charge of the sees of Waterford and Lismore. He must notice the union of Kilmore with Elphin, the noble Earl having made use of a former separation of Kilmore from Ardagh and their subsequent reunion as a precedent for the present changes. How came Kilmore and Ardagh separated?' Upon this ground, because Bishop Bedel, one of the best men who had ever adorned any Church, thought it right to resign Ardagh, rather than hold it in conjunction with Kilmore. But the Bill, if it took effect, would not only unite two sees, one of which the apostolic Bishop Bedel refused to hold in plurality, but it would join to them the important diocess of Elphin. So much for the noble Earl's precedent. This proposition had been mooted and very properly deseribed before. Some years ago a Motion was made in the other House of Parliament, embodying in a resolution a plan somewhat similar to the 838 present. A right hon. Gentleman then described that proposition as one which, ""if meant as a measure of conciliation, would be ineffective."" He said, ""if it were meant as a measure of conciliation, he would ask the House what single advantage it was calculated to give to the Roman Catholics of Ireland? The public mind had been prepared for some such proposition as the present by anonymous statements, reiterated insinuations, and unfounded exaggerations; and a formal attack was now for the first time made on the Established Church, in a point where it was supposed to be the most vulnerable, under the specious pretext of affording relief to Ireland. It was at present only proposed to clip the wings of the Church, and exhibit her in an humbled condition to her rival.""* Strange though it might appear, that same right hon. Gentleman took a large share in framing this Bill, though he had thus strikingly described its effects by anticipation on a former Occasion. In the conflicting authorities which had been quoted of that right hon. Gentleman, he should prefer that of the right hon. Gentleman's early opinion. He was, he would admit, at all times distinguished for great talent and great public and private worth; but at the period to which he had alluded, the right hon. Gentleman had not mingled in official life, nor learned to accommodate his feelings to official duties. He had not directed the current of his exalted morality into the crooked and narrow ways of political expediency; but it flowed fresh and vigorous, fresh from the generous source at which he had imbibed it. The right hon. Gentleman had not then stooped his high head to the dull level of ordinary men. At that time he had not come in any degree under the influence of that great arch-agitator of Ireland that enchanter, that Prospero of Ministers, from whose power it was not so easy for them who had gone within its influence, to escape, and who, whether he addressed his victim in the light and playful tones of the ""Dainty Ariel,"" or in the rough and sullen language of growling Caliban, was almost equally certain to have them do his bidding. He would next say one word as to the Commissioners who were to be appointed under this Bill. Three of these might be, and most Probably would be, laymen; but, whoever they might be, they were to have the power of nomination to the cure of * Hansard (new series) xi., p. 561.  839 souls. This was not only without example, but was contrary to all principle. If he were disposed to take a lower view of it, he might ask whether there was an instance of forming a corporation, eight out of eleven of whose members were removable at pleasure? This, however, was so trifling a part of the Bill, compared with those other parts to which he had referred, that he did not feel it necessary to waste their Lordships' time by dwelling further on it. One thing which greatly surprised him with respect to this Bill was the quarter from which it came, considering the opinions delivered on former occasions. The noble Earl at the head of the Government, and who took a zealous, active, and consistent part in the discussions on the Roman Catholic Relief Bill, urged as one of the arguments in support of that measure, that it would tend to increase Protestantism in Ireland that it would remove those causes which then tended to press down Protestantism in that country and that when that pressure was removed, it would spring up with redoubled force. It was, at the same time, urged by many other noble Lords who took part in that discussion, that the passing of that Bill would be the means of removing many difficulties with which Protestantism had to contend in Ireland, and that it would create friends for the establishment where it before had enemies; that, at all events, it would afford this security to the establishment that no one would, after it passed, dare to be a friend to the Catholics in any attempt against that establishment. In a published letter written by a noble Baron (Lord Holland) about the same period, and addressed to the reverend Dr. Shuttleworth, it was asked, whether the Catholics would give up all desire to attack or injure the Protestant Establishment, and the answer was supplied by the noble Baron himself, who asserted that they would; and that for more than twenty years before, they had openly renounced any such intention, and had promised that they would not use any power which might be granted to them by the Legislature to the injury of the Established Church. It was the confident reliance on these promises that had produced much of the support given to the question of Catholic Emancipation. It was the same confidence which made the noble Baron to whom he had alluded give his promise that he would support the protestant Establishment with, as he said, all its enormous revenues. He had no doubt, therefore, 840 that he should have the support of the noble Baron on this occasion. By the way, in alluding to the revenues of the Irish Church, it was now put beyond any question of doubt that the most egregiously erroneous statements had been made as to the amount of those revenues. Could those revenues be considered enormous which did not give an average income of 300l. a-year to every clergyman of the Irish Church? Another noble Lord (the Lord Chancellor of Ireland) of great and acknowledged authority, had, in a speech delivered on the subject of the Catholic question in 1829, said: 'The right reverend Bench in general have, in a manner which reflects credit on them as Gentlemen and as Christians, acknowledged the honour and probity of the great body of the Roman Catholics. Why, then, my Lords, they are willing to swear, and by this Bill they are required to swear, that they will not use their privileges to disturb or weaken the Protestant Establishment. Now, I really cannot understand what is meant by saying, that a man is amiable, exemplary in the discharge of all the duties of life, and that he is a most worthy moral character, and yet that you will not believe him on his oath?'* Unhappily, the Legislature did believe his oaths, and what was the result? The noble and learned Lord had added, on the same occasion: 'Millions of people desire admission to the privileges of citizens, from which the argument I now to deal with admits they ought to be excluded on mere political grounds. They do not seek to meddle with any of the rights or possessions of the Church, and they offer to bind themselves by solemn oaths, not to use their privileges for the purpose of doing so directly or indirectly. + My Lords, every Roman Catholic well knows, that the Protestant Establishment of Ireland is indissolubly wound up with the Establishment of England, and that neither the Church of England nor the Government of England will ever permit the Protestant Church of Ireland to be subverted. My Lords, I take upon myself to say, that such extravagant notions, which could not be accomplished without heaving the British Empire from its centre, do not enter into the contemplation either of priests or laymen of that persuasion.' That was the language of the noble * Hansard (new series) xxi., page 376. + Ibid. xxi. p. 379 and 377.  841 and learned Lord, who, relying on the promises of the Catholics, sought for them equal privileges with their Protestant fellow-subjects. He was not surprised that the noble and learned Lord should have had such confidence in the promises made by the Roman Catholics. What was the oath which they were called on to take by the Relief Bill before they could take a seat in Parliament? It had these words ""And I do hereby disclaim, disavow, and solemnly abjure any intention to subvert the present Church Establishment, as settled by law, within these realms; and I do solemnly swear that I will never exercise any privilege to which I am or may become entitled, to disturb or weaken the Protestant religion or Protestant government in the United Kingdom; and I do solemnly, in the presence of God, profess, testify, and declare, that I do make this declaration and every part thereof in the plain and ordinary sense of the words of this oath, without any evasion, equivocation, or mental reservation whatsoever."" Now, any man who took such an oath as that, and who was honest and meant to observe what he swore, would studiously abstain in his legislative capacity from doing that which would subvert or tend to subvert or injure the Protestant Establishment. Yet, after such a solemn test, he would beg their Lordships to consider what had been the estimate made of its obligation by many of those who had taken it. He would not refer more particularly to the language used in another place; but their Lordships must have observed, through the ordinary channels of communication, how lightly some individuals seemed to think of the obligation which they had undertaken by the oath he had read, and how strongly disposed they seemed to set that oath at nought. It seemed to be the opinion of those individuals, that as long as they did not interfere with the articles of the Protestant faith, they kept their oath, though they could not be ignorant that it was intended by those who drew up that oath, that it should not only prevent those who took it from acting injuriously to the Established Church, but that it also bound them to act with kindness towards that Church. He thought, that those Gentlemen were bound even by their voluntary pledges. He would remind their Lordships of a petition presented to Parliament in 1809, and signed by several distinguished Catholic peers of Ireland, such as Lords Fingall, Gormanstown, and Shrewsbury, 842 and by many other members of the Catholic body of that country, und amongst them it had the signature of Mr. O'Connell. The parties who signed that petition declared that they had no intention or desire to use any privilege they might acquire, to injure or weaken the Protestant Establishment of Ireland. The petition was afterwards printed with notes, and in those notes the same opinions were strongly avowed. In one of them, referring to the passage of the petition he had alluded to, it was stated, that the Catholics were, by that clause, pledged to the maintenance of the Protestant religion and government in Ireland as firmly as the Protestants themselves. Another part of the petition stated, that the petitioners did not wish in any manner to encroach upon the rights, privileges, immunities, and revenues of the Protestant clergy; and in a note to this passage, it was stated, that this pledge of the petitioners comprehended the words of the Coronation Oath; the petitioners declaring that it was not the intention of the Roman Catholics to infringe the sacred rights and immunities which the King, by his Coronation Oath, had solemnly bound himself to preserve to the Protestant Bishops and clergy. Yet, notwithstanding this declaration, subscribed, as he had stated, with the name of Daniel O'Connell, he (the Bishop of Exeter) held in his hand a recent letter from the same individual, recommending that in future there should be no more Protestant clergy in Ireland than were necessary for the Protestant population. He would allow the present incumbents of parishes in Ireland to remain as they were; but for the future, he would allow only as much as would support that number of clergymen as the Protestants might want. He had already alluded to the oath taken, and, as he would take leave to say, violated by Dr. Doyle, and he would not dwell further upon it then; but when their Lordships saw some of the heads of the Catholic Church in Ireland, such as Dr. Doyle and Dr. M'Hale, show such a disregard for the obligations of an oath, could it be expected that their flocks would be more observant of them? What might be expected from that, actually occurred. Experience confirmed what reason anticipated, and there was, though it was deeply to be lamented, a total disregard of oaths amongst the Catholics of Ireland. This was proved by the evidence of many respectable individuals who had gone some of the circuits of Ireland, and who had constant opportu-  843 nities of noticing this great disregard of oaths amongst the Catholics. They had the same fact attested by the evidence of a Roman Catholic priest, Mr. Collins, who admitted, in his examination before the other House of Parliament, that this disregard of oaths existed; and being asked to explain the cause, he attributed it to the poverty and ignorance of the people, and also to the conduct of landlords and their agents, who, in getting the people to vote at elections, showed, though moving in the ranks of gentlemen, as great a disregard of the moral obligation of an oath as their more humble and less educated dependents. He was asked whether much of this feeling amongst the poorer classes did not arise from want of proper instruction; and he admitted, that there was a great deficiency amongst them in that respect; but he added, that none of them were so ignorant as not to be aware of the nature and obligation of an oath. These were strong facts, and he would ask, if the people showed no regard for the obligation of an oath, how could it be expected that they would honour the law? It was unfortunately notorious, that they had no respect for it that they considered it meritorious in some cases to evade the law, and that they connected no moral obligation with its observance. Was this from ignorance? He rather feared that it was from too much instruction of a particular description, and from those who, possessing great influence, ought to have used that influence in a different direction. The celebrated pastoral letter of Dr. Doyle was, no doubt, familiar to most of their Lordships; but he could not avoid reading a few passages of it as an illustration of the pernicious kind of instruction conveyed to the people by those who ought to have given a very different kind of advice. The right reverend Prelate read the first passages of the letter, in which the writer spoke of the distress from the tithes, of the disturbances which existed, and the necessity of being peaceable, and his hope that the Legislature would take their case into consideration; with all of which the right reverend Prelate said no fault could be found; but the letter went on to say: 'I was withheld from addressing you by the hope which I have long cherished, and which I still cherish, of seeing your condition improved, and the causes as well as the pretences of your criminal combinations removed. I hoped to hear of your real grievances being candidly considered by the Legislature of a provision being 844 made by law for the poor and destitute of you of means of employment being furnished to you, especially to such of you as were cruelly ejected from your holdings;  I hoped all this, and that no man or woman could reproach me, when exhorting you to peace by thinking within themselves, or saying to me in words, ""Do you wish us to sit down, and die of hunger? Do you tell us from the Gospel, which the Lord has commissioned you to preach, that a man is obliged to starve in the midst of plenty, or that any law can be justified which banishes as a malefactor, or hangs as a felon, a man able and willing to work, but who, unable by any lawful means, to preserve himself and his children from starvation, employs such moans as occur to him to supply himself with food? If, in England, where the law proclaims that no man shall want a sufficiency of food  where every honest man, if disabled or unemployed, is invested by the law with the right to support for himself and his children if in England, where the law of self-preservation (the first law of nature) is there upheld and enforced by the laws of the State if in England, where the poor are so justly protected, men combine to violate the rights of property, let them be reproached as wicked, and punished as criminals; but until, in Ireland, the first law of nature is recognised; but until in Ireland the law proclaims, as it does in England, that no man, woman or child, shall perish of want, do not endeavour to persuade us that our duties and obligations are the same as the duties and obligations of those whom the laws of England, which should also be our laws, cherish and protect. You speak to us of the punishment which awaits us. What punishment can be greater than to die of hunger? You remind us of the affliction we bring upon our families. What affliction can surpass that of a mother and children driven in a state of utter destitution from the fire-side and threshold of their homes, to wander friendless and hopeless through a world that rejects them, till hunger and disease strike them to the earth, and death comes to absolve them from their sufferings. Go; tell the husband, the father, the brother, who has witnessed this scene, that he is a criminal if he revolt against such an order of things, and he will reply: You are not a minister of Christ, but of Moloch; for it is by Moloch, and not by the God of the Christians, that such bloody sacrifices are  845 required?"" Deterred (he added) by such arguments, I have not remonstrated with you us I ought, though I have often told you that your ways are evil. Even now, when I am forced to put away all doubt and hesitation. I do not pretend to disprove your arguments, of which a great many are founded on truth and justice. This, be it observed, was the language of a Roman Catholic Bishop, addressing his flock on the subject of their criminal practices. Dr. Doyle went on indeed to slates that their practices were wicked, because it was not only their own sufferings, but the sufferings of others, which they increased by them. Their resistance to the law, he told them, was wicked and vain wicked, because it did nothing but confirm the power of their oppressors vain, because the unorganized efforts of a mere rabble never could overthrow the authority of the Stale, He (the Brishop of Exeter) would not quote further from this document; he would merely remind the House, that this extract was taken from the letter in which the right reverend Prelate taught the population that their resistance to the law of tithes was not criminal, and that submission to a penal law was all that was required from a subject. The right reverend Prelate quoted the authority of Blackstone to bear him out in that opinion; but their Lordships were well aware, that Blackstone said no such tiling. The doctrine which Blackstone had laid down was most unsound; but even the doctrine of Blackstone did not go to the iniquity of Dr. Doyle, for all that Blackstone said was this ""In relation to those laws which enjoin only positive duties, and forbid only such things as are not mala in se, but mala prohibila, merely annexing a penalty to noncompliance, here I apprehend conscience is no further concerned than by directing a submission to the penalty in case of our breach of those laws."" Now, if that doctrine were true, a man was morally at liberty to incur debts to any amount, provided he would submit to the penalty of imprisonment. In other words, the right reverend Prelate taught the people to disregard the obligations imposed upon them by the law of the laud, and the moral obligations of conscience. That a populace thus taught should disregard moral obligations was to be expected, and was proved to be the ease. There was, he was sorry to say, in Ireland, not merely a disregard of honour and honesty, and of all morality, but of still higher duties. Sir Hussey Vivian, in the opinion he stated in evidence before the 846 Committee of the House of Commons, used tills language  In offering an opinion on the slate of Ireland, there is one thing I should wish to notice"", and that is the extraordinary carelessness of human life amongst the lower classes. I have endeavoured, as far as possible, to find out whence it arises that men who appear so kind in their dispositions, so grateful for any little kindness bestowed upon them, as the lower class of Irish generally are, should exhibit such little apparent reluctance lo destroy their fellow creatures. I have asked the Catholic clergy; I have expressed my astonishment that they who have such power and influence over the minds of the lower classes, do not prevent it; but neither they nor others I have spoken lo on the subject pretend to account for it. It is a very striking circumstance in Ireland, that a disturbance scarcely ever arises but you hear of the loss of life; and during the whole of the disturbances in England (I mean no invidions comparison) there was but one instance in which a hand was raised against an individual; it is a matter well worthy of the consideration of those who would civilize and tranquillize Ireland, to ascertain whence arises this extraordinary difference. He was then asked: Is not the use of ardent Spirits one of the causes of it?  This may account for those eases where murders take place at fairs; but many are committed in perfect cold blood. I could mention many instances of this sort.' Though this answer did not give a sufficient explanation, he thought, that their Lordships might find that explanation in the evidence of another person; It was that of the reverend John Burnett, a Dissenting Minister of Cork. That Gentleman had, on a former day, given some evidence which he afterwards felt it necessary to correct, or rather to enlarge. Mr. Burnett said but before he (the Bishop of Exeter) read this extract from the evidence relating to the Catholic religion, he begged to say, with the most perfect sincerity, that while it was extremely painful to him to speak of the outrageous feelings which he believed that religion had caused in the presence of noble Lords who professed that religion, but who were as free from those feelings as men could possibly be, who were as fully sensible as men could be of the impropriety of such feelings, and who, in their own conduct, were actuated by the highest principles of the Gospel; he said, while it was painful for  847 him to be obliged to speak thus of those who held the same doctrines as the persons alluded to in the evidence, he felt that his duty compelled him to do so, and that he must proceed Mr. Burnett said 'The view which I took of Catholicity in Ireland was the truth, but not the whole truth; and I therefore wish to make a few remarks on what I consider to be the effect of Catholicity. A question has been put to me as to the books used in the schools of the professors of that religion. I should not be acting fairly if I did not state, that most mischievous books were used in schools of that description. That hooks of a licentious nature were employed in those schools has been stated by the Commissioners of Education, but there are also Catholic books which are subversive of the first principles of morality and religion. The priests know well that these books are in circulation. They could prevent the circulation of them as easily as they could prevent the circulation of the Holy Scriptures, but they have not made any attempt to do so. He was then asked: Will you mention any of those books? One book is the Cord of St. Francis; the Scapula is another. There were also books of various orders and devotions. These works prescribed the forms to be used at devotions, and the Catholics connect with those forms the speedy release of the guilty from purgatory. The lower orders believe in these books, and act on their belief of them, and therefore it is, that no Roman Catholic believes that when he dies he is consigned to final perdition. I have spoken frequently to the lower order of Roman Catholics, and I never yet found one of them who believed that he would go to hell. If they die in mortal sin, they believe they go to hell; but if the priest gives them absolution, which, if called upon, he cannot refuse to do, then they believe that they only go to purgatory, from which they believe that the prayers of the faithful can rescue them. This conviction produces an injurious effect upon the moral and practical conduct of the people. It is easy to make a confession of sin and to rely on the prayers and orders of the faithful. On these they rely more than on the morality and religion of their conduct. Absolution destroys in their minds all fears of punishment in the world to come. I have found this feeling very general among the lower orders of Catholics, and I have seen them, 848 where they have been sentenced to death in Courts of Justice, exhibit no feeling of their awful situation. I attribute this to their conviction that the priest is able to everything for them that is necessary to ensure the salvation of their souls. I once saw thirty-five of them sentenced to death at once, and I did not see any one of them show the slightest emotion on hearing the sentence. All this I attribute to their belief in the doctrine of absolution'. He would put it, then, to their Lordships even on no higher ground than that of their duty as human legislators, looking only to the good of men in this world, and to the preservation of the peace of society, whether it was not the duty of those who had a share in the legislative power of the country to resist the influence of doctrines such as these, and to do their utmost to lessen the authority of such teachers? If they agreed with him, that such was their duty, he asked whether it was to be endured that a measure largely increasing the authority of these teachers, and largely, he would add, extending the influence of lessons such as these books inculcated upon the people, should receive their sanction? This brought him to the last topic to which he should advert, and it was one of a most grave and serious nature. It was a duty incumbent on all those who wished to uphold, as far as possible, the true Protestant religion, and most especially it was a duty which became them as legislators, to consider what was the obligation which their Sovereign had contracted at his coronation. He begged that their Lordships would not misunderstand him. He was far from saying that any opinion which he or any of their Lordships might form upon the tenour of that oath, and upon its application to the present Bill, was that which must necessarily be true, so that there could be no conscientious deviation from it. If, unhappily, the illustrious individual who would on this occasion have to decide this point for himself, and who, their Lordships were bound to believe, as he unfeignedly did believe, would decide it on the purest principles according to the dictates of his own conscience, should decide it differently from his opinion, it would be his duty to submit in silence; but at present he thought that it was incumbent upon them, as Legislators and Peers of Parliament, to bear in mind what it was their duty to do in respect to that oath, in tendering to his Majesty the present Bill. He felt, that it was his own duty he felt also that it was the duty of  849 all their Lordships to abstain must entirely from pressing on his Majesty or, indeed, from offering to his acceptance, any measure which was imagined not to be in accordance with the obligations which his Majesty contracted at his coronation. If their Lordships should think that the tendency of any measure was to shake the security of the Protestant Church Establishment, and to weaken the influence of the Protestant religion in this country, if they should think that the tendency of any measure before them was to violate that which his Majesty had sworn to preserve inviolate namely, the present settlement of the Church of Ireland, with the doctrine, discipline, and government thereof, he was certain, that there was not one of them but would join with him in saying, that it was their common duty to abstain from voting in favour of such a measure. Now that was his opinion of the present measure. But if it should pass into a law, and should unfortunately receive the royal assent, he should be convinced, that it had received the royal assent from the purest conviction of its necessity, and from a conscientious belief, that assent to it was strictly in accordance with the terms of the Coronation Oath. He should have been inclined to leave this topic out of his consideration, had not circumstances arisen which had pledged the House to the discussion of it, from that discussion he had not the slightest wish to shrink. It was not with any wish to utter a taunt against the noble Earl that he now stated that he had expected that the noble Earl would, on this occasion, have propounded the arguments which he had declared to be unanswerable in favour of his Motion, which he (the Bishop of Exeter) conceived to be unsound, inconsistent with the law of the land, and tending to the dissolution of the solemn compact made by the country with its sovereign. He meant the distinction which the noble Earl had drawn regarding the binding nature of the Coronation Oath upon the Sovereign in his executive and legislative capacity. It would be in the recollection of the House, that the noble Earl considered the question of the Coronation Oath as one which might be placed out of the thought of the Sovereign, in giving his assent to any measure which had obtained the approbation of the two Houses of Parliament. Now, he must repeat, that he had hoped that the noble Earl would have given him some arguments in favour of that opinion, for, as the noble Earl had already declared those arguments 850 to be unanswerable, he could not be afraid of any answer which they might receive either from himself or from any of their Lordships. Not having had the opportunity which he expected to have had at all events, and more especially from the circumstance of the noble Earl being entitled to a reply, he (the right reverend Bishop) was at a loss to know what arguments to address to their Lordships. It was true that the noble Earl had spoken on this subject on a former occasion, and he had been led to anticipate the argument on which the noble Earl relied at present, from the arguments which the noble Earl had employed on former occasions. On the fourth of April, 1829, the noble Earl said: 'I was glad to find that that noble and learned Lord (Lord Tenderten) did not lend the sanction of his high name and authority to what I cannot but consider the false and danger principles which have been recently promulgated on this subject; nor attempt to show that the Coronation Oath should be viewed as binding the King in his legislative capacity.' He had no doubt, from the whole of what followed, that the language was correctly attributed to the noble Earl; who had on that occasion considered it as a false and dangerous principle that the King should be bound in his legislative capacity by the Coronation Oath. The noble Earl had proceeded to argue in favour of that opinion, and his arguments, of which he (the right reverend Prelate) would not willingly omit one, rested upon the debate on the proviso which Mr. Pelham deemed it necessary to add as a rider on the Coronation Oath Bill, and on the letter of Lord Yester to his father, the Marquess of Tweeddale. Now he had read the debate on that proviso, and the conclusion to which he had come was quite different from that of the noble Earl. Many of the speakers on that occasion had said, that it was impossible for anything to proceed from that House which would impair its legislative powers; that the proviso, as far as it went, was not objectionable; that they did not feel it fit or proper, or decent, to intrude any measure on the Sovereign which would impose a restraint generally on his legislative capacity, but that they did not think it improper to impose this restraint on the matter which they were then upon namely, the binding the King in his legislative capacity with regard to the Church. He found authority for this in the language used upon that occasion by that  851 great and wise stateaman, Lord Somers. On the previous debate Lord Somers had been inclined to support the Motion, that the King, in his Oath, should swear to maintain the Protestant religion, which is, or shall be established by law. On that occasion he used this language: ""I desire the addition from great regard to the Legislature."" In the former paragraph it is ""statutes and laws and customs in being"" in the other establishment. He that gives his consent to take away, docs not ""maintain them,"" by which he understood Lord Somers to mean that he who gave his consent to take away could not be said to maintain, as he was bound by oath to do. But even if the language of the speakers in that debate had gone to the extent for which the noble Earl contended, he should insist that the language of such men was not conclusive as to the meaning of the law which they passed. Far from it. He held that the language of debaters on either side of a question was nut to be taken as the most fitting construction of the law which they were endeavouring to carry through, or to prevent from being carried through Parliament. The noble Earl had also referred, in support of his opinion, to another authority the letter of Lord Yester to the Marquess of Tweed-dale. It was dated April 9, 1689, and was to the following effect: 'I believe your Lordship will find, by the journals, the measures I have given were not much mistaken, and that now there is but a slender prospect of a comprehension, whereof the delays thrown in the way, and the desire of a convocation, are a sufficient evidence. However, I am told the King has declared himself in council as to the oath he is to take at his coronation that the sense he takes it in was as to his executive capacity, to maintain the Church as by law established, reserving liberty as to his legislative, to make therein what alteration might be thought fit hereafter.' He was surprised that so much authority should be attributed by the noble Earl, to a hastily written letter, upon the mere rumour of the day. Who ever heard of such a letter being taken as an authority upon a point of constitutional law? Would any of their Lordships take a rumour picked up in St. James's-street, or in some of the neighbouring clubhouses, as evidence of any fact at the present day? And if they would not take the mention of a rumour in a letter as evidence now, why should they attach greater sanc- 852 tity to a piece of paper which had no other merit than that of being 150 years older? There was, however, evidence of a negative kind, to prove that this rumour was unfounded. He put it to such of their Lordships as had had experience as privy councillors, whether, if such a communication had been made by the King to his council, there would not have been some record of it placed on the minutes. He would not, however, slop here. He said, that William 3rd was the last monarch who would have satisfied himself with making this private communcation to his council a communication which, if made at all, was of so private a nature, that he supposed that no person who had taken the privy councillor's oath, would have deemed himself at liberty to divulge it. Moreover, it was not likely that a conscientious man like William 3rd would have made any such mental reservation. He came down to Parliament to give his assent on the throne to the Coronation Oath Bill, and on that occasion he made no declaration as to the sense in which he should take the Oath. He took it, therefore, in the plain and natural sense which the words bore, and not in the sense which Lord Yester attributes to it upon rumour. The negative evidence, however, did not rest here. There was a curious circumstance in the history of King William, connected with the Oath which he took on his Coronation as King of Scotland. That Oath bound him to root out heresy. When it was tendered to him, he solemnly declared the sense in which he took it; for, he said, ""Let it be understood, that I do not hind myself by this Oath to become a persecutor."" This was pro tanto a reservation; from which it followed, that if King William took the Coronation Oath with any reservation, he would, in like maimer, have publicly said so, either when publicly taking it before his peers, or when giving the Bill the Royal assent. The whole argument, therefore, founded on Lord Yester's letter to his father, which he considered utterly unworthy of attention, fell to the ground, apart from the circumstances of improbability which otherwise surrounded it. Let them for a moment consider the nature of the distinction, which had boon attempted to be drawn between the King in his legislative and his executive capacity, on which was founded the untenable assumption, that the Coronation Oath bound him, not in his former, but in his latter capacity. Now, he held that the constitution did not recognize this  853 double capacity of the kingly office. He held, that the notion of a monarchy that is, an absolute monarchy as contra-distinguished from the limited monarchy of England, implied, that the whole government of the country was vested in the King; and that the notions of a limited monarchy implied that the King could exercise no royal functions unless with the advice of his Parliament and responsible councillors. This he need not tell them was the usage of the British Government. In the exercise of his higher duties, as a branch of the Legislature, the King is aided by both Houses of Parliament, in establishing and settling the law of the land, just as the privy council were his advisers in the case of proclamations, and so on with the other royal functions, placing it beyond doubt, that it was absurd to believe that the Coronation Oath bound the King in one capacity while it loosed him in another. That such was not the case he thought was evident from a consideration of the origin and tendency of the Coronation Oath. It was, perhaps, hardly necessary for him to remind them of the remarkable fact that the Coronation Oath of Edward the Confessor was in force till the reign of William 3rd; and that it was mentioned, eo nomine, in the Coronation Oath of James 2nd. The Oath was contained in the Leges Edouardi, c. 1., entitled De Regis officio et de Jure et Appendicibus Coronoe Regni Britannioe. Now, those laws distinctly showed the duty and office of the King, enjoining him to fear God and honour him above all things: that he should reverence the holy Church, and defend it against its enemies; that he make good laws and preserve approved customs; that he ought to distribute justice, and to take the counsel of his nobles, prelates, and wise men. If words had any meaning, did it not follow that that part of the Oath, which bound the King to make ""good laws and preserve approved customs"" applied to the King in his legislative capacity? And if so, was it not absurd to assert that the Oath bound him in his executive, but loosed him in his legislative capacity. The old language of the law confirmed this view, for, in old acts, it was always stated, ""Rex statuit,"" and sometimes it was said ""in Concilio Parliamenti,"" and sometimes not. The evidence, however, did not rest there. Some of their Lordships were perhaps not aware that there were Statutes of this land recognizing the Coronation Oath, as binding the King in his legislative capacity. Every 854 Sovereign, from Edward the Confessor to Edward 3rd, swore that he would make good laws and repeal bad ones; and there were not one or two, but a whole stream of instances, as had been remarked by an eloquent writer, which established this as the great constitutional principle, on which all laws were to be reviewed, and, if necessary, annulled. It was, in truth, the chief landmark of the Constitution. The first instance he would refer to was, the 7th of Edward 1., c. 1., called the Statute of Fines, which after confirming the Charier of Forests and Magna Charta, states, that the King should not give his assent to any laws ""contrary to his Coronation Oath,"" that is, that he was bound by his Oath in his legislative capacity. Then, in the next reign, they would find ill the 15th of Edward 2nd., this principle most explicitly asserted. That statute was a repeal of other statutes which Edward had passed in favour of the Dispensers; and it stated that these acts should be repealed, because, among other reasons, it was contrary to his Majesty's Coronation Oath, that bound him, at the risk of his soul, to make good laws, and to extirpate bad ones. The same principle was also asserted in the reign of that illustrious prince Edward 3rd. In the 15th of Edward 3rd, it was expressly stated, that certain things which had been improvidently done were to be revoked, because they were contrary to the King's Oath. But, without fatiguing them with more instances from the statute-book, he would briefly refer them to the proceedings of the Legislature at the time of the Union with Scotland. He need not remind their Lordships that great apprehensions were at the time entertained by the people of Scotland, lost the measure should prove detrimental to the interests of the Church of Scotland, the Legislature of England being ""essentially of the prelatic persuasion."" The assembly of the Church of Scotland accordingly petitioned, that the rights of that Church might be preserved entire; and in obedience to that petition, an act was passed, which did insure the integrity of those rights. But the Assembly was not satisfied, for they requested the security of what? Why, a Coronation Oath, and that security was conferred on them. But this was not all, for the members of the ""prelatic persuasion"" in their manner, also entertained apprehensions for the integrity of the Established Church, now that Presbyterian peers and commoners were likely to become members of the  855 united Legislature; and they, in their turn, demanded the security of the Coronation Oath for the interests of the Church of England, and that security [Lord Plunket; The Church of England and Ireland.] He thanked the learned Lord. The Church of Ireland was included. He was not surprised at the friendly remonstrance, knowing that that learned Lord agreed with him, that the Coronation Oath applied to the King in his legislative capacity. [""No, no,"" from Lord Plunkett No!] he was astonished by the denial. It would be in their Lordships' recollection that Lord Kenyon had been requested by his late Majesty to give his opinion of the Coronation Oath; and the opinion which Lord Kenyon gave to a late King on the point, was well worthy of their Lordships' attention. Lord Kenyon said, ""that the whole of the present system was carefully framed, to guard against the introduction of Popish influence into any of the branches of the Legislature. In the Sovereign, this was provided for by the oath which he took; in the Houses of Parliament, by the Declaration of 2nd Charles 2nd."" Unless the learned Lord was most grossly misrepresented, he on referring to this opinion of Lord Kenyon, had said, ""the opinion was that of a sound lawyer and an honest man. There might be cases in which a King was not justified in adopting the advice even of his Councillors, viz: when that advice was in direct opposition to his Coronation Oath. For instance, if an Act was passed to overturn the Protestant Hierarchy, no doubt the Coronation Oath would prevent him from assenting to it. That was not a question which required a moment's deliberation. The Coronation Oath was a bond between his conscience and his God."" This was said by the noble Lord, in a speech made by him on the 10th of June, 1828, and it was this emphatic language, which made him believe that the learned Lord, like himself, conceived the Coronation Oath to bind the King in his legislative no less than his executive capacity. If he was wrong, the learned Lord would, of course, set him right. The right reverend Prelate concluded with thanking their lordships for the attention with which they had heard him. He was ashamed at having detained them at such length, and could only say, that he should not trespass on their forbearance at such length in future."	239.0	1833.0	1830	[('common', 'common',

150321	150321	S3V0067P0-01142	1843-03-21	TREATY OF WASHINGTON.]	Viscount Palmerston*		"Viscount Palmerston*: I rise, Sir, in pursuance of my notice, to move for copies or extracts of the communications which have taken place between the British Government and Lord Ashburton, their plenipotentiary at Washington, on the subject of the treaty signed at Washington on the 9th of August last; and for reasons which I will proceed to state, I am induced to hope that her Majesty's Government will not refuse me these papers. In the first place, her Majesty's Government have already laid upon the Table a portion of the papers, which were included in my original notice. In the first week of the present Session, my hon. Friend, the Member for Montrose, asked the right hon. Baronet at the head of the Government, if he did not mean to lay before Parliament those communications between Lord Ashburton and Mr. Webster which had been laid before Congress, and which had been published in all the newspapers in the United States and in England. The right hon. Baronet at first gave a hesitating answer; but on being further pressed by my hon. Friend, he ended by what appeared to me to be a pretty positive refusal. Thereupon I gave notice that I should move for the production of those papers, and the silent eloquence of a notice on the order book, seems to have been more persuasive with the right hon. Baronet than the viva voce appeal of my hon. Friend; for the right hon. Baronet, without waiting for my motion, laid the papers on the Table, and they have been for the last week in the hands of hon. Members. Therefore, as the right hon. Baronet has been induced to reconsider his first determination in regard to this part of the correspondence, I am not without hope that, upon further reflection, he may also reconsider the intention which he has announced to withhold that second portion of the correspondence for which I am now about to * From a corrected Report.  1163 move; and that, although he said a few days ago that he would not grant it, he may, when he has heard my arguments, be prevailed upon to comply. Again, the right hon. Baronet, without even being asked to do so, has recently laid upon the Table the correspondence between the late Government and their plenipotentiary at Washington, upon the Boundary Question, from June, 1840, to August, 1841; not merely extracts, but complete copies of our instructions to Mr. Fox, and of his replies to us. I am glad the right hon. Baronet has done so. These papers are a continuation of the previous correspondence of the same kind, which we ourselves had, upon two former occasions, laid before Parliament at the suggestion of the right hon. Baronet; and it was right and proper that Parliament, having had the previous part of that correspondence, should also have its conclusion. But as the right hon. Baronet has thought that no public inconvenience would arise from laying our correspondence on the Boundary Question before Parliament, I should hope that he will not think that any public inconvenience would arise from also laying before Parliament the correspondence of the present Government upon the same question. If our correspondence has been thought fit to stand the light of day, it is to be hoped that theirs will not be thought by themselves less fit to undergo the same ordeal. I have, then, in support of my present motion, the example of what both we, when in office, and the present Government, now that we are out, have done in regard to our negotiations on this Boundary Question; and I trust that what has been thought right in regard to our correspondence, will not be thought wrong in regard to theirs. Moreover, there are persons in this country who are disposed to approve of this treaty of Washington, There is nobody, I believe, who thinks it a good treaty, nobody who does not think it a bad and very disadvantageous bargain for England. But there are some people who were so anxious to get the dispute settled, that they are glad to see it settled upon any terms, even upon the disadvantageous conditions contained in this treaty. Those persons are disposed to bestow praise upon the parties by whom this transaction has been brought about; and it is right that such persons should know in what proportions the praise which they are ready to award, should be divided 1164 between the Government that gave the instructions, and the plenipotentiary who conducted the negotiation. On the other hand, there are persons, of whom I profess myself to be one, who think that this transaction deserves blame; that the negotiation was unskilfully conducted; that the tone of the British representative throughout was undignified; and that the terms agreed to by the treaty are unnecessarily disadvantageous to Great Britain. Such persons ought to be able to know in what proportion the blame which they think to be due should be shared by the Government at home, and the plenipotentiary at Washington. Both parties, therefore, those who praise and those who blame, equally stand in need of the papers which I am going to move for, in order to arrive at a right judgment on these matters. But for my present purpose, which is to discuss these matters, the treaty itself, and the correspondence between Lord Ashburton and Mr. Webster, which has been laid on the Table, will be sufficient; and the arguments by which 1 shall endeavour to support my opinions will find foundation enough in these documents alone. I well know that in proceeding to express my dissatisfaction at the Treaty of Washington, I shall be met with the stale and hacknied charge that my language and opinions have a tendency to disturb the friendly relations between this country and foreign powers, and to bring on the risk of war. It is easy to endeavour to silence by such accusations those who think the Government have not properly maintained the interests, or asserted the honour of the country. But I shall not be deterred by such a charge from performing what I think a public duty. On former occasions I have disregarded such imputations, and I shall equally disregard them now. I trust that the part which it fell to my lot to take in the management of our foreign relations, during the ten years I had the honour to hold the seals of the Foreign Office, will afford a sufficient proof that I am not so irrational as not fully to appreciate the value of peace. There is indeed no rational man in these times, and in this country, who must not feel that peace is one of the greatest blessings which nations can enjoy, and that war is one of the severest calamities that can afflict mankind. But if this be true in the abstract, and if peace in general, and with all nations, ought to be the great aim of those  1165 who are charged with the Government of this country; the United States is of all countries, that with which it ought to be our object to maintain, not merely peace, but the most intimate connection. I remember to have seen in the writings of a clever Frenchman the remark, ""that nations have no cousins;"" by which I apprehend was meant, that nations in their relations with each other are not swayed by those sympathies and affections which guide the mutual intercourse of individuals, but are governed by a dry regard to what they may from time to time believe to be their own particular interest. The remark is a just one, and ought never to be lost sight of by public men. But if there be an exception to that maxim, that exception may be found in the connection that exists between this country and the United States. The people of the two countries may indeed be termed blood relations; community of origin, of language, of literature, of manners, of laws, of religion, almost identify the two nations; while the peculiar nature and character of the industry of each, fit the two, in a remarkable degree, for mutual commercial intercourse. But still the people of the United States are a separate political community, divided from us by geographical position, and having separate interests of their own, which may on many occasions conflict with, and be at variance with ours, and on such occasions, as they most assuredly will not unduly sacrifice their interests for us, so neither ought we unduly to sacrifice our interests for them. The permanent security of peace is not promoted by such sacrifices; for it is a maxim of international intercourse, that unequal treaties and compacts, however much they may seem to smooth temporary difficulties, and to get rid of embarrassments of the moment are not in the long run consistent with reciprocal good feeling, and tend to endanger rather than to consolidate peace. Therefore, if this treaty is unfair in its terms, and unjustly disadvantageous to England, it is not calculated to promote in the end that concord and harmony which I am sure we all of us wish to see established between Great Britain and the United States. I will not trespass upon the time of the House by describing in detail the origin and progress of those differences about boundary, between the British North American provinces and the United States, which this treaty professes to settle. These 1166 matters are well known to all. It is well known that these differences arose out of the preliminary treaty of November 1782, and the definitive treaty of September 1783, which acknowledged the independence of the United Slates, and fixed their boundaries. The preliminary treaty of 1782, described what those boundaries were to be, and the definitive treaty of 1783, repeated word for word the description contained in the treaty of 1782. But the article in the treaty of 1783, which contained that description, contained also a remarkable preamble, a preamble remarkable as an instance, shewing how vain are sometimes the expectations of those, who boast that treaties like these, have settled all disputes, once and for ever. The second article of the treaty of 1783, begins with these words:  ""And that all disputes that may arise in future on the subject of the boundaries of the said United States may be prevented, it is hereby agreed and declared that the following are and shall be their boundaries,  And then follows a description of those boundaries in the same words as in the preliminary treaty of 1782. But this treaty, which was to prevent all future disputes, has been the fertile source of disputes from that time to this. For every part of the boundaries therein described, except such parts as were defined by well known rivers, or by the beach of the sea, has been by turns the subject of controversy. But my present business is only with that part of the boundary which lies between the mouth of the St. Croix in the Bay of Fundy, and the point where the forty-fifth parallel of north latitude strikes the river St. Lawrence. That portion of the boundary is thus described in the treaty. It is therein said that the line is to run from the mouth of the St. Croix in the Bay of Fundy, up the middle of the stream of that river to its source; thence due north to the Highlands, to those Highlands, namely, which divide rivers that empty themselves into the river St. Lawrence from those which fall into the Atlantic ocean; then down along those Highlands to the north-westernmost head of the Connecticut river; then down the middle of that river to the forty-fifth parallel of north latitude; then along that parallel till it strikes the river St. Lawrence. Now the first dispute which arose upon this part of the boundary was as to which river was the St. Croix. There are several ri-  1167 vers flowing into the sea in those quarters which, at various times, had received from the French the name of the St. Croix. The Penobscot and the Scondiac had each received that name. The American negotiators of the treaties of 1782 and 1783, had indeed taken care to exclude the Penobscot; because they had specially described the river which was to be the boundary, as being the St. Croix which has its mouth in the Bay of Fundy; thus distinguishing it from the Penobscot, which has its mouth out of the Bay of Fundy, and in the Atlantic Ocean; but there is another smaller river with an unpronounceable Indian name, which has its mouth also in the Bay of Fundy, but still further eastward than the Scondiac, and to this river the Americans laid claim as being the St. Croix of the treaty. This question was decided in favour of Great Britain, and justly; for there can be no doubt that the Scondiac is the river meant to be designated in the treaty as the St. Croix. The next question was, which was the source of St. Croix. That river, like most others, branches off as you follow it upward from its mouth, into a number of confluent streams, and the question was, which of the two principal branches should be considered as the main stream, and should bear the name of the river itself. We claimed the stream which had its source most to the westward; the Americans claimed the stream which had its source about eighteen miles further to the eastward. The British and American commissioners had previously agreed upon an arbiter to decide between them in case of difference; that arbiter happened to be a citizen of the United States, and this question was decided against us, and the easternmost source was fixed upon as the starting point of the due north line. This decision was clearly wrong, and has been the cause of much inconvenience since; but the British Government of the day formally acquiesced in it; and the faith of the country having been pledged, there was no possibility of retracting the acquiescence thus given. A monument was then erected at the point so determined, to be considered as the source of the St. Croix, and that monument became thenceforward, the starting point for the due north line. Commissioners were then appointed under the stipulations of the treaty of Ghent, to trace upon the ground that due north line from this monument to 1168 the Highlands, and from thence, down those Highlands, and along the forty-fifth parallel to the St. Lawrence. These commissioners began from the monument, but they soon differed. The British commissioners declared, that they had found, south of the St. John, and not far from Mars' Hill, the Highlands of the treaty, and there they asserted the due north line ought to stop; and from that point, they said the boundary was to run along Highlands, south of the St. John, to the head of the river Connecticut, The American commissioners, on the other hand, denied that these were the Highlands of the treaty, and pushed on the due north line, about a hundred miles further, and declared that they had found the Highlands of the treaty at the source of the Metis, a long way north of the St. John, and not far from the bank of the St. Lawrence. Here, then, was another point of difference. The British commissioner maintained, that the boundary from the due north line to the head of the Connecticut, ran south of the St. John; the American commissioner asserted, that it ran north of that river. Upon the next part of the boundary they agreed. Both parties concurred in declaring that the mountain range which runs from the sources of the Connecticut in a north-westerly direction, is for about eighty miles of its north-westerly course, a portion of the boundary according to the treaty of 1783; because that mountain range fulfills the conditions of the treaty, by dividing the Chaudiere which falls into the St. Lawrence from the Kennebec, which falls into the Atlantic Ocean and, moreover, it runs down into the sources of the Connecticut. At about eighty miles north-west of the Connecticut, and somewhere near the source of the Metjarmette, this portion of the boundary, mutually acknowledged as such, was met by the two lines which the British and American commissioners respectively drew from the due north line, the one to the south, the other to the north of the St. John. But then a difference arose as to which of the confluent streams, which unite to form the Connecticut, should be deemed to be its north-westernmost source. The Americans claimed the confluent, most to the west, called Hall's Stream; I we claimed the confluent most to the east, which passes through the Connecticut Lake, and which from its greater size and volume, is evidently the main branch of  1169 the river. The district lying between these two streams, and which would be American or British, according as the one claim or the other might be established, is not very large, but is pretty well inhabited. From this quarter down the Connecticut River, to the 45th parallel of north latitude, of course there could be no dispute; but a difference arose as to the line which should be deemed to be the 45th parallel of north latitude from the Connecticut to the St. Lawrence. This same parallel of latitude had been an inter-provincial boundary before the revolt of the North American colonies, and on that account it was adopted as an inter-national boundary in 1782 and 1783, because the treaties then concluded, acknowledged the independence of certain provinces which had taken part in the war. This line was laid down and marked out in 1772, by two surveyors, Valentine and Collins, as the boundary between the provinces of New York and Quebec; and, from the treaty of 1783 down to 1818, the line so laid down by those surveyors had been considered to be the boundary between the United States and Canada; and the land on each side of it had been settled accordingly. But in 1818, in pursuance of the Treaty of Ghent, two skilful astronomers, the one appointed by Great Britain, and the other by the United States, laid down this line anew by correct astronomical observation; and the result of their observations, in which they both unanimously concurred, was, that the old line of Valentine and Collins was wrong, and that for a distance of more than 100 miles, the true parallel of latitude runs from half a mile to a mile further south than the line of Valentine and Collins; and that thus a strip of that length and breadth, which till then had been supposed to belong to the United States, did, in fact, according to the letter of the treaty of 1783, belong to Great Britain. This strip happens to contain a military position of some importance, called Rouse's Point, a small peninsula at the northern end of Lake Champlain, commanding the entrance into that lake, from the River Richelieu. On this point, the Americans, believing the ground to be their own, had begun a military work, the completion of which they suspended in consequence of the discovery made in 1818, that the strip did not belong to them. These then were the points of difference betweeen the two 1170 governments about the boundary, from the Bay of Fundy to the River St. Lawrence, in latitude 45; and not being able to come to an understanding on these points, they agreed by treaty in 1827, to refer them to the arbitration of some friendly sovereign, formally binding themselves to abide by his decision; and in 1829 they chose the late king of the Netherlands as arbiter. The points to be referred were, which were the Highlands of the treaty of 1783; which was the north-western-most head of the Connecticut River, and how the 45th parallel of north latitude was to be ascertained. The House may naturally ask what difference could arise between the two governments on this last mentioned point, seeing that the American and British astronomers had unanimously concurred in their correction of the erroneous line of Valentine and Collins. The fact is, that it was thought by the Americans an object of importance to retain the strip, which lies between the two lines, both because, as I have stated, it had been occupied by American settlers, and because it contained the commanding position of Rouse's Point. They therefore bethought themselves of some expedient by which they might claim it. The heavens would not give them what they wanted, so they had recourse to the lower regions of the earth. ""Flectere si nequeo superos, acheronta movebo."" Astronomical observations would not serve their turn, so they put forward the principle of geocentric measurement. They said, that the proper way to ascertain parallels of latitude was not, as hitherto practised, by astronomical observation, but by drawing lines from the centre to the circumference of the earth. Now as the earth is not a perfect sphere, but somewhat flatter at the poles than at the equator, lines drawn at equal angles from the centre, to different parts of the circumference, will cut off unequal portions of the surface of the earth, according as they intersect that surface nearer to, or further from, the equator; and it appeared that the 45th parallel ascertained by this method, would lie some way further north than when ascertained by the usual method of astronomical observation. This doctrine was strongly resisted on the part of Great Britain, and it is but just to the United States' government to say that it  1171 wag given up by them in 1829, when the two parties laid their statements before the arbiter. But they then took up another ground and contended that the avowedly erroneous line of Valentine and Collins ought to be adopted in preference to the correct line laid down, in 1818, by the British and American astronomers. This, then, was one point to be referred to the arbiter. Another was, which was the northwestern-most head of the Connecticut River; and the third point was, which was the north-west angle of Nova Scotia, or in other words, which were the Highlands of the treaty. These two last mentioned questions were in fact identical, as will appear from the following considerations. If the words of the proclamation of 1763, which define the boundary between the province of Quebec and the province of Nova Scotia, be compared with the words of the treaty of 1783, which describe the boundary between the two countries, it will be obvious that the same Highlands which made the former boundary were intended also to constitute a portion of the latter. But to establish the boundary between Quebec and Nova Scotia, the proclamation of 1763 took those Highlands all the way from the 45th parallel to the end of the Bay of Chaleurs, whereas the treaty of 1783 made the international boundary run along them from the head of the Connecticut, only as far as the point where the due north line from the source of the St. Croix should intersect them. The point, therefore, where the due north line should intersect the range of Highlands which extended from' the head of the Connecticut to the end of the Bay of Chaleurs, would evidently become the north-west angle of Nova Scotia, and the north-east angle of Maine. The three points just mentioned were elaborately argued in statements prepared by each side; the two governments communicated these statements to each other, and each made a counter-statement in reply to the statement of the other party; and these statements and counter-statements were sent to the King of the Netherlands in 1829. In January 1831, about two months after Lord Grey's Government came into office, the King of the Netherlands made his award; and that award came to this country accompanied by a protest which had been made against it by Mr. Prebble of the State of Maine, then representative of the United States at the Hague. Mr. Prebble 1172 made this protest upon his own responsibility, and without instructions from his government; and he founded his protest upon the circumstance that the king of the Netherlands had made an absolute decision upon two only, out of the three points referred to him, and had stated in regard to the third, that no absolute decision could be made upon it, and that he therefore thought it proper that a middle course should be adopted with respect to it; and Mr. Prebble contended, that although the two governments were bound by the treaty of 1827 to submit implicitly to the absolute decisions of the King of the Netherlands, they were not bound to subscribe to the middle course which he had thought the proper one to be adopted. The two points which this award had decided, were decided in our favour. It decided that the 45th parallel of north latitude should be ascertained by fresh astronomical observation; but it added, that as this decision would give to Great Britain the long strip between the correct line and the old line of Valentine and Collins, and as that strip included Rouse's Point, on which the Americans had gone to some expense in building a fortified work, Rouse's Point ought to remain with the United States. The award decided that the stream which we claimed as the north-westernmost head of the Connecticut River is the stream which ought to be so considered. But in regard to the question where the north-west angle of Nova Scotia ought to be, that is to say in regard to the question whether the range of Highlands claimed by us, or that claimed by the Americans, were the Highlands of the treaty, the King of the Netherlands said that no absolute decision could be made. He said that neither the one range nor the other fulfilled, entirely and strictly, the conditions of the treaty of 1783. Those conditions were, that the Highlands should be the Highlands which divide the rivers that empty themselves into the St. Lawrence from those which fall into the Atlantic Ocean, and that these Highlands should extend continuously from the point where the due north line intersects them, down to the sources of the Connecticut River. I think that a fair construction of the words of the treaty does not require that the Highlands should fulfil the river-dividing condition at the particular point at which the due north line intersects them. That condition was mentioned in  1173 order to identify the Highlands which were intended to be the boundary; and if Highlands are found which in any part of their course fulfil that condition, and if they extend continuously from that point to the point where the due north line intersects them, it seems to me that those are the Highlands of the treaty. But the king of the Netherlands took a different view of this matter, and he assumed that the Highlands to be found, ought, according to the treaty, to fulfil the river-dividing condition at the particular point at which the due north line intersects them. But this he said neither of the two lines did. As to the mountain range on the north of the St. John, claimed by the United States, he said that range did indeed throw down rivers or streams along its northern slope into the Lawrence, but that all the streams which fell down the southern slope of that range were intercepted by the St. John before they could reach the Atlantic Ocean, and were carried by the St. John, not into the Atlantic Ocean, but into the Bay of Fundy, which the King of the Netherlands considered the treaty of 1783 to have contradistinguished from the Atlantic Ocean. As to the mountain range to the south of the St. John, claimed by Great Britain, he said that this range did indeed throw down rivers, such as the Penobscot, along its southern slope, into the Atlantic Ocean; but that all the rivers which flowed down its northern slope must be intercepted by the St. John before they reached the St. Lawrence, and were by the St. John carried not into the St. Lawrence, but into the Bay of Fundy. Therefore, as neither line appeared to him to fulfil the conditions of the treaty, he declared that it was fitting that an intermediate line should be adopted; and this line, beginning at the point where the due north line intersects the St. John, was to run up along the mid-channel of that river to the mouth of the St. Francis, then up the middle of the St. Francis to its source, then to the nearest point of the line claimed by the United States, and thence along that line down to the north-westernmost head of the Connecticut River. It became the duty of the British Government, upon receiving this award, to consider what they should do. We might have taken the same objection to it which Mr. Prebble, acting upon his own authority had made. But considering the unqualified nature of the engage- 1174 ment entered into by the British Crown, by the treaty under which the reference was made, we did not think that a due regard to the honour and good faith of the country would allow us to take that ground. If we had done so, and if the American government had afterwards insisted upon having the award executed, and if serious differences had thereupon arisen between the two countries, and we had been obliged to come down to Parliament for support, I think that Parliament would not have sanctioned such a course; but would rather have been of opinion that we had taken our stand upon too nice a point, and that the friendly relations of the two countries ought not to have been disturbed on account of so technical a distinction. Moreover, it did not appear to us to be expedient to object to that award. It is true, the award was very disadvantageous to England as compared with what we believed, and what all our predecessors had believed, to be our just right to the whole of the territory in dispute. But the British Government had decided not to stand out nakedly for our extreme right, when it had agreed to refer the matter to arbitration. We felt warranted in assuming that our predecessors in the Government had accomplished al that labour could effect in collecting information, and had exhausted all the resources of ingenuity in founding arguments upon that information. The statement of our case submitted to the King of the Netherlands was indeed a goodly folio volume; and therefore, there seemed no reason to suppose that if we rejected that award, and went to another arbitration, we should be able to make any important addition to the matter which had been submitted on our behalf to that Sovereign. Nobody could doubt the fairness and impartiality of the King of the Netherlands, or the laborious industry with which his Government had investigated the questions which they had had to consider; and, therefore, it did not seem probable that if the same statements were to be laid before another arbiter, supposing the Government of the United States to consent to such a course, any more decisive or satisfactory result could be obtained. It was not probable that we should find any other arbiter more favourably disposed towards us than the King of the Netherlands. There were circumstances at that moment which must have tended to make  1175 him incline as much in our favour as a sense of justice would permit him to do. Great Britain was one of the powers who were at that time engaged in settling questions deeply affecting his interests; and it was not likely that he should go out of his way to excite the resentment of the British Government by swerving from just impartiality to the prejudice of Great Britain. We therefore transmitted this award to the government of the United States, informing them that we were willing to submit to it in its entirety, in pursuance of the engagements taken by Great Britain by the treaty of 1827. At the end of a year and a half, in July 1832, the Senate of the United States came to a decision on this matter, and determined to reject the award, upon the same grounds on which Mr. Prebble had in the outset protested against it. For some time afterwards, not seeing any better course, we continued to press the American government to reconsider their determination. At last, finding that they persisted in rejecting the award, we declared that we were no longer bound by our offer to accept it, and that thenceforward the two parties were as free in this respect, as they were before they had agreed to refer the matter to arbitration. Various propositions were then from time to time made and discussed between the two Governments. We wishing to negociate for a conventional line, while the United States government urged that further endeavours should be made to trace out the line, in conformity with the words of the treaty. There was one proposal made with this view by the American government, which at first sight seemed to hold out the prospect of a result highly favourable to Great Britain. Mr. Livingston suggested that, as it appeared, from the result of the reference to the King of the Netherlands, that no such Highlands as those described in the treaty could be found in a due north line from the source of the St. Croix, and as both Governments had at various times expressed an opinion that in this respect the treaty could not be literally executed, an attempt should be made to find the Highlands of the treaty to the westward of the due north line; and that a line drawn from such Highlands to the head of the St. Croix, should be part of the boundary. Mr. Livingston said, that such a departure from the strict words of the treaty would 1176 be justified by some principles of surveying practised in America; and that Highlands so found, if they fulfilled the conditions of the treaty, might be declared by the federal government, upon its own constitutional authority, to be Highlands of the treaty. At first sight this was a tempting proposition; because it seemed to be an abandonment, on the part of the American government, of the whole of the disputed territory. For every body knows that by going far enough westward, such Highlands could be found; every one knows that west of the sources of the St. John, and between the sources of the Chaudiere and Kennebec, Highlands exist, which do indisputably divide rivers that empty themselves into the St. Lawrence, from rivers which fall into the Atlantic Ocean; and if it had been agreed that a line drawn from those Highlands to the monument at the source of the St. Croix, should be the boundary, such a line would have given to Great Britain more than she had ever claimed, more than the whole of the disputed territory. But nobody could be so simple as to suppose that such was really Mr. Livingston's intention. In order, however, to ascertain what the intention of the American government really was, it was necessary to find out whether they persisted in adhering to the American interpretation of the treaty of 1783, by which it had been contended that no distinction was to be drawn between the Bay of Fundy and the Atlantic Ocean, and that for the purposes of the treaty the St. John was an Atlantic river. For if they adhered to this interpretation, then the only effect intended by this proposal of Mr. Livingston was to amend the American case in a point, in which it was confessedly defective. The defect I allude to in their case was this, that the north line, when it comes to the point at which they would make it finish, and from whence they would branch off to the westward, along their assumed Highlands, that is to say, about the source of the Metis, does not intersect a mountain range, but terminates in a flat swampy tract, elevated, no doubt, above the level of the sea, but constituting a table land rather than a mountain range. But it was known that some ten or fifteen miles to the westward of this point the hills rise, and begin to assume the character of a mountain range. If, then, by the adoption of Mr. Livingston's proposal, the line had been de-  1177 flected from the due north direction to this point, the Americans would have said, now we have found the Highlands of the treaty, for you cannot deny the mountain character of these hills, and they fulfil the river-dividing condition of the treaty, since they throw down streams to the north into the St. Lawrence, and to the south into the St. John, which falls into the Atlantic Ocean. We found, upon inquiry, that the American government still adhered to their interpretation of the treaty of 1783 upon this river question, and the only concession they would make on this point was, that the British and American commissioners to be employed in laying down the boundary should be accompanied by an arbitrating commissioner, to be appointed by some friendly sovereign, and with power to decide all matters, including this river question, upon which the British and American commissioners might differ. But this river question lay at the very root of our claim. We were thoroughly convinced of the correctness of our interpretation of it, and the King of the Netherlands had adopted that interpretation; and it would have been very unwise to have exposed so important a point to hazard by subjecting it to the chance of another decision, by the inferior arbitrating authority of a single commissioner. The question, as I have already said, was whether the Bay of Fundy is or is not, for the purposes of the treaty, a part of the Atlantic Ocean. The British Government had always contended, and in my opinion most justly, that the words of the second article of the treaty of 1783, establish a clear distinction between the Bay of Fundy and the Atlantic Ocean. It was necessary for the purposes of the American negotiators that such a distinction should be clearly established, because without such a distinction, it might have been doubtful whether the Penobscot or the Scondiac was the St. Croix intended as part of the boundary. Both rivers had borne the name of the St. Croix; but the Penobscot has its mouth in the Atlantic Ocean, the Scondiac has its mouth further east in the Bay of Fundy; and in order to shew that it was the Scondiac, and not the Penobscot, that was to be the boundary, the treaty says, that the line is to be drawn along the St. Croix from its mouth in the Bay of Fundy while in the preceding sentence it mentions the river St. Mary as falling into 1178 the Atlantic Ocean. Another confirmation of our interpretation is to be found by comparing the wording of the proclamation of 1763 with that of the treaty of 1783. Both of these documents mentioned the same range of Highlands, namely, the range which extends from the sources of the Connecticut to the upper end of the Bay of Chaleurs. The proclamation declared that range in its whole extent to be part of the southern boundary of the province of Quebec. The treaty declared that part of that range which should lie between the sources of the Connecticut and the due north line from the head of the St. Croix to be a portion of the boundary of the United States. But there is a most important difference in the terms in which the proclamation and the treaty describe those Highlands. The proclamation describes them as the Highlands which divide rivers that empty themselves into the river St. Lawrence from rivers that fall into the sea. While the treaty describes them as the Highlands which divide rivers that empty themselves into the river St. Lawrence from rivers that fall into the Atlantic Ocean. Why was the more general term, the sea, which was used in the proclamation of 1763, converted into the more specific term, the Atlantic Ocean, which was used in the treaty of 1783? Why, manifestly in order to establish a clearer distinction between that portion of the sea so intended to be described, and that other portion of the sea which was intended to be described as the Bay of Fundy; and, as on the one hand, for American purposes, the Bay of Fundy was specified in order to identify the river meant as the St. Croix, and which has its mouth in that bay, so on the other hand, the Atlantic ocean was specified for British purposes, in order to identify the rivers flowing to the southward, which the dividing Highlands were to separate from rivers falling into the St. Lawrence. Not choosing, as I have said, to leave the decision of this question to a single arbitrating commissioner, we agreed, however, that commissioners should be appointed by the two governments, who should explore and examine the country, ascertain facts, and report for the information of the two governments; believing that such a commission might furnish the two parties with the elements by which they might arrive at a better understanding. In the course of our communica-  1179 tions we had come to an agreement with the American government as to such an arrangement, and we sent them a draft of a convention framed in accordance with that agreement. But when the American government received that draft, they changed their mind; and said, that circumstances which had happened on the frontier led them again to press for the appointment of a commission, which should not merely ascertain facts and report, but should finally decide and settle everything. With this view, they proposed a commission to consist of six; three of whom were to be appointed by each party; with the understanding, that if two on each side, that is to say, four out of the six, concurred on any point, their concurrence should be decisive as to such point; and that all points upon which two on each side, making four on the whole, could not agree, should be referred for arbitration to another commission to consist of three scientific men, one to be named by each of three friendly powers. Anxious to bring this long pending matter to a final settlement, we agreed to this proposal, as we had before assented to the previous one. But then the American government endeavoured to attach to this arrangement fresh conditions, to which we could not possibly agree, and so the matter rested when we went out of office. One of these conditions was, that we should acknowledge Mitchell's map to be evidence bearing upon the question. Now Mitchell's map is well known to be extremely erroneous as to the latitude and longitude of important places. Fox instance, the upper end of the Bay of Chaleurs is put down in that map, at least, forty miles too far to the north, and the source of the St. John about the same distance too far north also. The effect of these errors is, that if you draw a line from the sources of the Connecticut to the upper end of the Bay of Chaleurs upon Mitchell's map, that line will run entirely north of the river St. John, whereas if that line be drawn upon a correct map, or be traced out upon the face of the country, it will run, as far as the disputed territory goes, entirely to the south of the St. John; we therefore refused to admit Mitchell's map as evidence of the topography of the country; we contended that as no map had been attached to the Treaty of 1783, it did not signify what map had been used by the negotiators of 1180 that treaty, and that the questions at issue must be decided by the words of the treaty, and by the real configuration of the country itself. We were ready to agree that each party might lay before the commissioners any maps or documents which they might choose to produce, but we maintained that such maps and documents must be considered only as exparte statements, unless their correctness and validity should be acknowledged by the commissioners on both sides. Another condition much pressed by the American government was, that commissioners from Maine should accompany the Joint-Exploring Commission, and to this we decidedly objected. We had all along urged the American government to agree to a conventional line, as we saw no prospect of an agreement in laying down the line according to the words of the treaty. But the federal government had declined our proposal, and the ground they took was this: they said that they could not agree upon a conventional line without the consent of the State of Maine, because a conventional line implied a giving up of some claimed right which had not been disproved; and they could not give up any such right on the part of Maine without the consent of that state. Now Maine had formally refused to consent to a conventional line, had declared its opinion that the boundary could be laid down in strict conformity with the words of the treaty, and had called on the federal government to make another endeavour to do so. But the interpretation of the treaty rested with the federal government alone, and that the government was competent without the concurrence of Maine, to take all necessary steps for carrying the treaty into execution. We had acquiesced in this doctrine. But when the thing to be done was to establish a joint commission to carry the treaty into execution, we held it to be directly at variance with that doctrine, to propose that agents from Maine should accompany that commission. Such agents could have no legitimate functions to perform, and it was obvious that their presence would give rise to perpetual disputes, and would convert the enacampment of the commissioners into a constant field of battle. The pretext upon which the federal government urged this proposal was, that circumstances might arise in the course of the survey which might afford an opening for a negotiation for a con-  1181 ventional line; but the obvious answer to this was, that even if such should happen, our negotiation for a conventional line must be with the federal government, and not with agents from Maine; that it would be for the federal Government, and not for the British Government, to come to an understanding with Maine; and that there would always be time enough for that; and that for such purpose it could in no degree be necessary that agents from Maine should accompany the commission. But the late Government did not confine themselves to these negotiations; we thought it expedient to gain information for ourselves, without waiting for the appointment of this joint commission, and in1839 we sent out commissioners to survey the two lines of boundary claimed by Great Britain and the United States respectively, and to ascertain by local observation which of those two lines fulfilled most nearly the conditions of the treaty of 1783. Those conditions being, that the Highland range must be continuous to the sources of the Connecticut from the point of its intersection with the due north line from the head of the St. Croix; and that it must in some part of its course divide rivers falling into the St. Lawrence, from rivers falling into the Atlantic Ocean. Two most able and experienced commissioners were appointed for this purpose, Colonel Mudge and Mr. Feat her stonhaugh. It is impossible to speak too highly of the skill and scientific knowledge which they brought to bear upon the performance of their duties, nor could anything exceed the personal labour and fatigue which they underwent in order to perform those duties efficiently and correctly. They had all proper aid in the way of assistants to accompany them, and they were provided with every instrument which they deemed necessary or useful; and I am confident that implicit reliance may be placed upon the result of their labours. They returned to this country in the beginning of 1841, and proved by their report that the line claimed by Great Britain did fulfil the conditions of the treaty; that it did divide rivers that fall into the St. Lawrence from rivers that fall into the Atlantic Ocean, and that it was continuous, from its intersection with the due north line, down to the head of the Connecticut. These commissioners had not lime to survey the 1182 whole of the line claimed by the Americans, but from what they had observed, there was good reason to think that such line did not fulfil the conditions of the treaty. In consequence of this, we sent out a second commission, in the summer of 1840; and this commission, consisting of Captain Broughton, of the engineers, and Mr. Featherstonhaugh, jun., was directed to explore the line claimed by the United States. These commissioners returned at the end of 1841, and it appeared by their report that the line claimed by the Americans in no respect fulfilled the conditions of the treaty. In the first place, it did not constitute a Highland range at the point where it was intersected by the due north line, for that line, as reported by these commissioners, terminates in a low swampy flat near the source of the Metis; secondly, it did not in any part of its course divide rivers falling into the St. Lawrence from rivers falling into the Atlantic Ocean; and lastly, instead of running down in a continuous range to the sources of the Connecticut River, it swept away far to the westward of those sources, and was separated from them by an extensive plain at least five and twenty miles broad. This, then, completely decided the question as to whether the mountain range claimed by the Americans could be the Highlands of the treaty; because even if they had presented the proper character of elevation at the termination of the due north line, which they did not; and if they had divided rivers falling into the St. Lawrence from rivers falling into the Atlantic Ocean, which also they did not; no line of boundary drawn along them could ever reach the sources of the Connecticut, which the treaty required the line of boundary to be drawn along the Highlands to do. Here we had proof, afforded by actual survey, completely establishing our own claim, and completely negativing the American claim, and this proof was still further corroborated by the arguments contained in the report of Colonel Mudge and Mr. Feat her stonhaugh, and founded on a minute examination and comparison of official records. These were the proofs then which the present Government had in their possession at the beginning of 1842; proofs which none of their predecessors had had, and which placed them, in regard to this boundary question, in a situation entirely different from that  1183 in which any preceding Administration had stood. They had not indeed at that time in their possession other evidence of which we have lately heard so much; they had not then that red-lined map, on which Dr. Franklin one of the American negotiators of the treaty of 1782 had marked down the boundary in exact conformity with the British claim; but that red-lined map was at that time in the hands of the American government; and so, between the English documents on the one hand, and the American documents on the other, the proof of the entire justice of our claim was established in the fullest and most conclusive manner. Thus circumstanced, the British Government had their choice what course to pursue. First, they might have carried into execution the"" plan, which, in principle, and in all but some of its accessory details, had been agreed upon, between their predecessors and the American government; and they might have established a joint commission for laying down the boundary, with an accompanying arrangement for arbitration in case of difference; and they might have felt the more at their ease as to the probable result of such a commission in consequence of the knowledge which they then possessed, that the features of the country were decidedly in favour of our claim. But they may have thought that this course might be tedious, that the survey might occupy much time, and that it was desirable to settle the matter sooner than could be done by such a survey. In that case they might have proposed to the American government a fresh reference to arbitration. In the present state of the world, an impartial sovereign might surely have been found, willing and able to undertake the task. To such a sovereign we might have referred not only the statements submitted to the King of the Netherlands, but the important and conclusive evidence which had been collected since; and though we were not in possession of Dr. Franklin's red-lined map, yet it seems that in the beginning of 1842, a red-lined map of our own was discovered in the State Paper Office in London, tallying precisely with Dr. Franklin's red-lined map in the Royal Library at Paris. So armed, I think the British Government might have gone fearlessly to another arbitration. But I will admit, for the sake of argument, that the Government may have thought a second arbitra- 1184 tion likely to be too dilatory a process, and even with all our proofs, not unattended with risk. They may have feared that the most impartial sovereign might be swayed by some jealousy of the power and greatness of England. A third course was then open to them, that of endeavouring to negociate with the Federal Government direct, for a conventional line. This was the course they adopted; I do not blame them for it; it was what we always wished; but we were repeatedly told that the State of Maine would not consent to a conventional line and insisted on the line being drawn in strict conformity with the treaty; but it was natural to suppose that in proportion as the people of Maine found that the surveys of our commissioners had shewn that the strict execution of the treaty would be all in our favour, they might become more disposed for a conventional line, and less urgent for the strict execution of the treaty. Assuming, then, that a negotiation for a conventional line was to be the course, there were two ways in which that negotiation might be carried on; first, by the ordinary organs of negotiation, that is to say, either with the American Government through our established Minister at Washington, or through the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, with the American Minister here; or, secondly, it might be carried on by a special mission. There are advantages in carrying on a negotiation by the ordinary and established organs of the Governments concerned. A negotiation so conducted may not attract much notice; its existence may, indeed, scarcely be known, except to the parties engaged in it; and if it should fail, its failure may escape general observation, and may leave the two parties much in the same relative situation in which they stood before; excepting always the additional inconvenience of its having been found, that at least one scheme of arrangement had proved to be impracticable; and therefore, in general, it is better to negotiate by the ordinary organs, than by a special mission. There is, besides, another inconvenience attending a special mission; for not only does its failure leave, by means of its publicity, the matter which was to be settled, in a worse situation than it was in before, but a knowledge that such will be the consequence of failure, exerts a pressure upon the special negotiator and upon the Go-  1185 vernment that employs him. No man who goes with pomp and parade upon a special mission likes to come back empty handed; he fears that his want of success will be ascribed, at home, not so much to the unreasonableness of the other party, as to his own want of skill; he will, therefore, always be urging his Government to make every possible concession, rather than let him return leaving the matter unsettled. On the other hand, the Government who has sent him, will not like to have entirely failed; and thus special missions are apt to turn out in favour of that party which is the most pertinacious; and those who have read the papers on the Table, will easily see which party had the advantage in that respect, in this late negotiation. But the Government determined to send a special mission; and I will not take upon me to condemn the prudence of that decision. They may have had sufficient ground for such a course; but then they ought to have been very careful in the selection of the Minister they sent out. The noble Lord for North Lancashire said upon a former occasion, that there could not be two opinions as to the choice they had made, and that the noble Lord who had been sent out, was admitted by universal consent, to be the fittest person for the purpose: I stated at the time that I differed from the noble Lord opposite, and that for various reasons I thought the choice which had been made, was an inexpedient one. Now, in arguing this matter, I trust 1 shall not be led to say anything inconsistent with the most perfect personal respect for the noble Lord who was employed on this mission. That noble Lord has long held a prominent position in political affairs in this country. He is deservedly respected by all, for his public talents, and is esteemed for his private virtues by all who have the pleasure of knowing him. Nothing can be further from my wish than to say anything which can favour of personal disparagement of that noble Lord; but in this country, if any man accepts public employment, and more especially if there be committed to his charge great national interests, he must expect that those who may think that he has not properly performed his duties, nor sufficiently guarded the public interest, will criticize freely the course which he may have pursued. Now, when we are about to entrust the manage- 1186 ment of any interest, private or national, to the hand of an individual, we naturally look out for somebody who is heart and soul in our cause; who is convinced that we are right, and thinks that the matter we are contending for is of real importance to us; and especially we are careful that the person so to be employed, should have no conflicting feeling towards the adverse party, by which he might unconsciously be swayed in the performance of his task. Now, the noble Lord in question, has large possessions and a princely fortune in this country, and has interests here of the deepest and strongest nature; but he is also connected by many ties of a similar kind with the United States. Do I find fault with him for this? or do I mention it in disparagement of him? Quite the reverse. I think, that the circumstance that eminent men should be found, possessing large properties in both countries, is not only honourable to such individuals, but advantageous to both nations. Such men are bonds of union between the two; they are links tending to connect the two countries in permanent friendship, and to prevent small differences from assuming a serious aspect. But every man has his use. If the two countries were to agree to appoint one person as sole mediator between them, they might properly appoint a person having almost equal interests in each, and an almost equal desire for the welfare of each; but when the Government are about to appoint a negotiator to fight the battle of the country with an adverse negotiator, whose feelings are all enlisted on the other side, they ought to choose a man who has no connection of any kind with the other party, and it is as well that he should have some knowledge of the practice of negotiation. I know that some persons imagine that in negotiation a plain, simple, straight-forward man will do just as well as the most experienced and skilful diplomatist. But the House may depend upon it that the same rule holds good in negotiation, as in any other employment of the intellectual faculties, and that a man, who has some acquaintance with the practice, will, coeteris paribus, have an advantage over a man who has none. But the noble Lord, though long and much engaged in public life, has never, that I am aware of, been employed in diplomatic negotiation. Now was the Government driven by any  1187 necessity to appoint an inexperienced negotiator, and had they no other choice? If they wanted a man of great skill and knowledge as a practical negotiator; perfectly conversant with the question to be discussed; intimately acquainted with the country in which, and with the people with whom the negotiation was to be carried on; and remarkable for his conciliatory manners and disposition; they might have chosen Sir Charles Vaughan, many years our representative at Washington, and who was one of the most popular Ministers we ever had in any foreign country. But if the Government thought that the splendour of a title, and the dignity of a peerage were necessary to give full weight to the mission, and if they wanted to unite with those conditions, eminent talents and long experience in the diplomatic profession, there was Lord Heytesbury, one of our most distinguished diplomatists, well known also for his conciliatory manners; and though the course of his professional duties had not led him to have any concern with the question to be treated, yet his great capacity would have enabled him in a very short time, to make himself fully master of it. Either of these men would have been well suited to the purpose; and there was nothing in the political opinions of either, to prevent the most confidential communications between them and the Government. The Government, however, chose Lord Ashburton; and he proceeded to his post, and opened the negotiation with Mr. Webster; making in the very outset a mistake, which arose from his not being sufficiently acquainted with the practice of negotiation. The noble Lord complained in his first note, that it was unfair, that he should be subjected to the disadvantage of having to speak first, and to make the first proposal. Now there seems to me to have been nothing unjust or unfair in requiring the noble Lord to make the first proposal, even if it were a disadvantage for him to do so. It was natural for Mr. Webster to say to Lord Ashburton, you have been sent here by your Government, uninvited, upon a special mission; you have left all the enjoyments of your home, to cross in the midst of the gales of winter the broad Atlantic; you surely must have something to say: you must have some proposal to make tell us what it is. It was unreasonable in the noble Lord to expect that Mr. Webster 1188 was to make a proposal to him. But I do not agree with the noble Lord in thinking that it is a disadvantage to have the first move in negotiation any more than at chess; if that move is skilfully made. If indeed that first move is unskilfully and imprudently made, then in negotiation as at chess, he who makes it may be checkmated, as the noble Lord has certainly been. However, the noble Lord made his proposition, and described it as an ultimatum; and this, I think, was another mistake. It was a mistake so to describe it, if he did not mean to take his stand upon it; if he did not mean to do so, it was a mistake to begin with it. I think it ought to have been his ultimatum; for he ought not to have consented to any territorial division less advantageous to England than that which he at first proposed. But it is unusual in negotiation to make a first proposal, an ultimatum; it is not courteous; it is dictatorial and offensive to the other party. It is the way a very strong power treats with a very weak one: a conqueror with the vanquished. ""My first word is my last: take this, or you shall have nothing."" Such a course is not consistent with courtesy, either between nations or individuals. Every negotiator wishes to be able to shew to the Government which employs him, that he has gained something by the skill with which he has conducted the negotiation; so that by asking at first something more than you are prepared to take, and by making a little concession afterwards, you give your adversary the means of going back with a feather in his cap; and his feelings are gratified by his being able to shew, that he has obtained for his country, better terms than were at first offered to him. Lord Ashburton's first proposal, in regard to the boundary was, that the line should run along the mid-channel of the St. John, from the point where the due north line intersects that river, up to its southernmost source; with the exception only that the Madawaska settlement on the southern bank of the St. John, should belong to Great Britain. He said, that on general principles he should have been content with the St. John as a boundary, because a river was a good line of demarcation; but he was under the necessity of insisting upon retaining for Great Britain the Madawaska settlement. The people had urgently and recently petitioned the Crown not to transfer them to the United  1189 States; it would be unjust and cruel to abandon them; and in no case could he consent to do so. Now, what said Mr. Webster to this? He replied A river boundary is no doubt a good one; rivers and mountains are the best boundaries; but you depart from your own principle of a river boundary, when you demand the Madawaska settlement. If we were to give it you, we should have, for a certain distance, a boundary drawn arbitrarily across the country, and marked by no natural feature; and this would be inconvenient. Moreover, let me tell you in a friendly way, that as to the Madawaska settlement, you cannot, and shall not, have it; for we cannot permit you to have a foot of land south of the St. John. To this Lord Ashburton replied That it was very hard and very cruel to transfer the British subjects in the Madawaska settlement from an allegiance which they desired to retain, to one which was repugnant to their feelings; but if he could not keep them, and must not keep them, why he supposed that he must give them up; and, therefore, although he had said that in no case could he abandon these people, yet, if other points were agreed upon, he would make no insurmountable difficulty about this. Mr. Webster, in the same letter in which he insisted upon having the Madawaska settlement, made his counter proposal for the remainder of the boundary line. He said that a river boundary was undoubtedly one of the best; but then there were rivers and rivers; and though the St, John would make a very good boundary, up to a certain point, yet beyond that point it took a crooked turn, and would not do, He said, that he knew what England wanted as well as, or better than, the noble Lord. All that England wanted, or could possibly want, was a road of communication between New Brunswick and Canada; and that, she ought to have. But the footway between the two, runs first along the St. John, and then up the Madawaska river, and so on by the Temiscouata lake. The boundary ought then to follow this line; to run along the St, John, to the mouth of the Madawaska, up that river to Long lake, and then across to the line claimed by the United States, and so on to the source of the Connecticut. But as the British footway runs along the western bank of the Madawaska, he would allow us a strip of three 1190 miles wide along that bank so as completely to include that footway. This proposition produced upon Lord Ashburton an effect somewhat like that which the Chinese said a proposition of theirs produced upon Sir Henry Pottinger, our negotiator at Nankin. The Chinese said, that when they made certain propositions to Sir Henry Pottinger, ""The barbarian stared at them indignantly."" The British Plenipotentiary at Washington seems indeed to have stare at this proposal of Mr. Webster's, but there was not much indignation in his stare; although this proposition gave to England less than the award of the king of the Netherlands would have given, and we were besides to make several additional concessions which I shall hereafter mention. It was once said by the hon. Member for Finsbury (Mr. Wakley) that governments are made of squeezable materials. But the most squeezable materials may be squeezed so hard that you can reduce them no further; even the air, one of the most yielding of known substances, may be so compressed, that the whole power and art of man cannot get it a hair's breadth further. So was it on this occasion with Lord Ashburton. The Madawaska settlement he was ready to give up, though he had solemnly declared that in no case would he do so. But this further proposition of Mr. Webster's was too much even for him. He protested that it was impossible to submit to it, and that rather than let the boundary fall back from the St. John to the Madawaska, he would himself go back from Washington to London. This was the very thing the Americans were watching for; this was exactly the thing which they wanted to find out. They wanted to ascertain what was the extreme point to which our plenipotentiary could be driven, and what was the utmost extent of concession which could be wrung out of him. Wherever he definitively stopped, there they were prepared to stop also. It is said of the Welsh peasantry, that in making a bargain with an Englishman, they care not so much for the actual amount which they may get, as they do to have the satisfaction of knowing that they have got all which it is possible for them to obtain. So it was with the Americans, they wanted to find out how much it was, by any means, possible for them to get from our negotiator; they had now found it, and they were satisfied. Accord-  1191 ingly, Lord Ashburton's refusal to accept this proposal of the river Madawaska as a boundary was communicated by Mr. Webster to the commissioners from Massachusets and Maine, who had been summoned to assist him in the negotiation; and those commissioners, but especially those from Maine, replied by letters, which beginning with flourishes that seemed the prelude to a rupture ended by a relinquishment, for the sake of peace and concilliation, of the demand which they had previously made. Mr. Webster then proposed to Lord Ashburton another line of boundary, not quite so bad as that which Lord Ashburton had thus rejected; but still giving to the United States a large tract of territory north of the St. John, and therefore beyond the line which our negotiator had begun by proposing as his ultimatum. Now, whether our plenipotentiary was, or was not, right in beginning with an ultimatum, it must surely be clear that having stated his first proposition, as one from which he could not in any case depart, he ought to have stuck to his declaration. It is not consistent with the dignity of a great country, that its plenipotentiary should say one day ""This is my proposal, and beyond this I will not go,"" and that in the very next step of the negotiation, when he finds his proposal objected to, he should give it up as readily as he had made it. I think he should have taken his stand upon the Madawaska settlement and the fine of the St. John. We had in our exclusive possession the whole of what that line would have given us, and as long as we had chosen to keep it, the Americans never could have got it from us. But I will assume, for the sake of argument, that our minister might have been justified in giving up the Madawaska settlement south of the St. John; either being convinced by Mr. Webster's reasoning in favour of a river boundary; or being swayed by any other consideration; or having been instructed by his own government to do so. But I cannot conceive any justification for his acquiescing in Mr. Webster's proposal of a line north of the St. John. His reply should have been, you objected to my proposal that Great Britain should retain the Madawaska settlement south of the St. John, alleging that in that case a part of the boundary would not have been marked by a river, or by any natural feature of the country, but 1192 would have been a line to be arbitrarily traced; and now you yourself depart from your own principle of a river boundary, and propose one, of which a considerable portion is marked by no natural feature either of river or mountain, but runs along the country like a steeple chase, crossing and overleaping all natural alignments. When our Plenipotentiary asked for the Madawaska Settlement, south of the St. John, Mr. Webster told him that he could not have it; for that England could not be permitted to retain one foot of land south of the St. John; Lord Ashburton ought to have replied in a similar way to Mr. Webster's demand for territory to the north of that river, and to have said to him, in an equally friendly but in a firm manner, you will not let us have anything south of the St. John, and as a friend allow me to tell you, that we will not permit you to have one foot of land to the north of that river; you cannot have it, and you shall not have it. But could we have made good such a declaration? For nothing certainly can be more unwise than to make a declaration of such a kind, unless you have the means of making it good. Most undoubtedly we could have made it good. No American had ever set foot to the north of the St. John, and none could ever get there but by our permission. The tract of country demanded by Mr. Webster was exclusively in our hands, and if not obtained from us by concession, could never have been wrested from us by force. I am thoroughly convinced, that if our negotiator had shewn upon this question the same firmness which Mr. Webster displayed about the Madawaska Settlement, we should have had the boundary of the St. John, instead of the wretched Boundary of the present Treaty. But I will suppose that he was not warranted by his instructions in holding such vigorous language; still, even in that case, there were other means which, if judiciously employed, might have obtained for us at least the Boundary of the St. John; for the negotiation went upon the assumption that the Boundary should be settled upon the ground of reciprocal considerations and equivalents. But considerations and equivalents presuppose some basis agreed upon by the two parties, and the ill result of this negotiation was in a great measure owing to the erroneous basis on which our Plenipotentiary allowed it to be placed.  1193 I said, that the first move in a negotiation is an advantage, if it is skilfully played; and why? Because it enables the negotiator who speaks first, to choose his own ground, and he is thereby the more likely to arrive at a satisfactory result. Now the basis which Lord Ashburton ought to have taken was, that Great Britain was entitled to the whole territory in dispute; but instead of this he allowed Mr. Webster to place the negotiation on the basis, that the whole territory belonged of right to the United States; and that all that England was to be permitted to retain, was to be bought by her for considerations and equivalents. Lord Ashburton ought to have been instructed-to begin by submitting the whole of our case to Mr. Webster, and to have explained to him fully the grounds on which our claim rested. He should have stated our case frankly, without reserve or concealment, as a man anxious to make a good settlement between two friends would do; and he should have invited a communication equally frank and unreserved from Mr. Webster. He might have said, as he did, that he was a plain man, not accustomed to the arts of negotiation, and that he thought a frank and unreserved comparison of cases might be a good preliminary to a fair settlement. He should have laid before Mr. Webster the two reports of our Commissioners, and should have explained their bearing on the case; and he should have exhibited that red-lined map, which was found in our State Paper Office, shewing the Boundary to be such as we claimed it. Who knows what effect such frankness might have produced upon Mr. Webster who knows, that on the sight of our red-lined map, he might not have exclaimed, 'Well, to tell you the truth, we have got a red-lined map also, and here it is, and I must fairly confess that it tallies exactly with yours.' I cannot help thinking that if this course had been pursued, a different result would have been obtained; at all events, such a course and such an explanation of the proofs of our claim, must have had an effect upon so sagacious a man as Mr. Webster. He might not have acknowledged that his own opinions were shaken, but he must have seen that our proofs might go far to convince an arbitrator. It was a matter of the utmost importance that, in a negotiation of this kind, we should be enabled to shew in the outset, that the strength 1194 and merits of the case rested with us. In the settlement of any matter, public or private, which is to be adjusted upon fair and equitable terms, the question, what terms are fair and equitable between the parties, must depend upon the relative justice of their respective claims. That settlement which would be fair if one party is in the right, would be unfair if the right lay with the other party. In a private arbitration the main point to be ascertained is, which party would be most likely to be successful, if the matter ended in a law suit; and that party ought of course to have the best of the compromise. This is human nature. I say then that our Plenipotentiary made two mistakes in the outset of the negotiation. First, in throwing overboard all discussion as to the proofs of the respective claims of the two countries; and secondly, in allowing the American minister at once to place the negotiation on the basis, that the whole territory in dispute belonged of right to the United States, and that all we were to get of it was to be obtained by concessions and equivalents. However, the negotiation had arrived at the point, at which Mr. Webster said, that the most advantageous boundary which we could be allowed to have, was a line up the St. John, from the due north line to the mouth of the St. Francis; thence up the St. Francis to a certain lake, and thence in a straight line across the country to a certain point on one of the northern branches of the St. John, and thence to the source of the Connecticut. This line giving to the United States a large tract of territory to the north of the St. John. I will suppose, that on the one hand Mr. Webster would not consent to any division of the territory more favourable to Great Britain, without some equivalent; and that Lord Ashburton could not, according to his instructions, insist upon a more favourable division, without purchasing it by some equivalent. Were there not several things which our negotiator might have offered as equivalents for this territory north of the St. John? Undoubtedly there were. First, there was the privilege of carrying United States produce, duty free, down the St. John, through New Brunswick; and thence, if we chose to allow it, duty free to this country. This was a great boon to be offered to the people of Maine. It was a privilege they had formerly asked for, and were most  1195 anxious to obtain. Here was one equivalent that might have been offered. Then, again, there was the territory at the head of the Connecticut, lying between Hall's Stream, which had been claimed by the United States, and the main stream, which had been declared by the King of the Netherlands to be the true north-westernmost source, and which any man going to the spot must at once see is the main stream. This territory was certainly not so large as that demanded by Mr. Webster, north of the St. John; but it was of more relative value, and was occupied by settlers, while the other was an un peopled desert. Here was another equivalent. Than there was the long strip a hundred miles in length, and varying from half a mile to a mile in breadth along the forty-fifth parallel, and lying between the old line of Valentine and Collins, and the true line laid down by the American and British astronomers. No doubt could exist that this strip was ours, according to the treaty of 1783. But this might have been given up to the United States, either with or without Rouse's Point, as might have been deemed most expedient. Here was another equivalent, and one which the Americans would have felt to be of great value; because this strip is chiefly peopled by citizens of the United States, who would dislike being transferred to British dominion; and because Rouse's Point is an important military position. Again, there was a sugar island called St. George's Island, between Lake Huron and Lake Superior, containing about 25,000 acres of fertile land, and claimed by us, but which both from its value and its position was desirable to the United States; here was another element of negotiation. To these three last cessions Mr. Webster might have objected that they must of course go to the contiguous States and not to the State of Maine; and that consequently they would not form equivalents for the territory north of the St. John, which, if retained by the United States, would belong to Maine. But the answer to this would have been, we know nothing of the differences between Maine, New York, Vermont, and New Hampshire; in accordance with your constitution we negotiate with you, the Federal Government of the whole Union; to you we give, from you we receive; and it is for you to apportion among your component States the results of our negotiation. But 1196 if this objection created a difficulty, there was the mineral district, consisting of 4,000,000 of acres, lying between Lake Superior and the Lake of the Woods, which, if given up, would belong to the Union in the aggregate, and not to any separate State, and this might have formed another equivalent. Here then were a number of things, any one or all of which, if necessary, might have been given in exchange for the territory north of the St. John. But before the negotiation had arrived at the point at which these equivalents might have been offered for the territory north of the St. John, all these things were gone. They had all been given away; spontaneously and gratuitously. Our plenipotentiary had indeed gone over to America with a bag full of equivalents to be used if necessary; but he was so uneasy under the weight of this burthen, that the first thing he did, was to throw down his bag and its contents at the feet of Mr. Webster, to shake it out clean, and to take good care not to leave a single thing at the bottom. Mr. Webster very naturally took up the squandered equivalents, one by one as they were thrown down, and put them one by one into his own pocket, in order that they might not be taken back again. He said, you give us the navigation of the St. John; we are really very much obliged to you; it is a valuable present, and a thing we have long wished for. You have given it us, and we will keep it. You offer us the district at the source of the Connecticut. This is not so important a gift as the other, but still for friendship's sake, I willingly accept it. Again, you say you are determined to give us the long strip along the forty-fifth parallel, including Rouse's Point. This certainly is an important gift; I can assure you we understand the full value of this, and are very much obliged to you for it indeed. But what is this: oh this is a sugar island; thank you very much for it; we have no sugar islands of our own; to be sure you have plenty, but it was very good of you to give us this. As to the 4,000,000 of acres of mineral district, our negotiator was also thanked for it; and Mr. Webster probably thought, that though as yet it can be of little value to either party, still, if British capitalists can be persuaded to lend money to work it, it may turn out a source of much profit to the United States. Thus, were all these  1197 things thrown away in the beginning of the negotiation: and when our plenipotentiary wanted something to give in exchange for the territory north of the St. John, he had nothing left to offer for it. Thus situated, he had no alternative but either to break off the negotiation or to submit to the terms that were imposed upon him. He preferred the latter course, and said, ""Draw up your treaty as you please; send it me quickly, and I will sign it at once,"" and so it was done. I contend that in this way a treaty has been signed, containing terms disadvantageous to this country; and which, if the negotiation had been conducted with more skill might have been avoided, and which I am very sure we should not have had to submit to, if either of the diplomatists whom I have mentioned had been employed in this business. Why, let me ask, did the Americans insist upon having territories north of the St. John? That district could be of no value to them for any of the ordinary purposes of territory. We have been told by Lord Ashburton, and it was not denied by Mr. Webster, that the territory north of the St. John grows little timber, and that when the timber now upon it shall have been removed, the land is ill adapted for cultivation and settlement; it connects no two portions of the United States territory, but is an excrescence jutting out beyond the rest of their frontier. But it has one, and one only value to them; it is a salient point, projecting into our limits, and interposing between Canada and New Brunswick, by which they will have additional means of threatening us in case of new differences, or of attacking us in the event of war; and it is precisely on this account that they ought not to have been allowed to have it. [Cheers.] I know very well what the right hon. Baronet opposite means by that cheer. He means that we were willing to accept the award of the King of the Netherlands, and that by his award this territory was to belong to the United States. I am quite aware of that; but I say it is childish to tell me that because ten years ago the former Government, in a very different state of knowledge as to the proofs of the justice of our claim, and impelled by a sense of treaty obligations, thought fit to submit to that award, therefore the present Government, with full proofs of our right, and unfettered by any treaty, ought vo- 1198 luntarily to accept such disadvantageous terms. It is true that we have retained our roadway from New Brunswick to Canada; but the United States frontier is carried up so near to the St. Lawrence, that in a state of hostile relations they would be able to cut off the communication by land between New Brunswick and Quebec. As to the free navigation of the St. John, those who are advocates for free-trade, in its largest sense, and who think that imports should be exempt from all duties whatever, will view with satisfaction the article of this treaty, by which the produce of Maine, both Corn and Timber, will be admitted duty free into the United Kingdom, upon passing down the St. John through New Brunswick; and it will not diminish the satisfaction of such persons to be told, that as the Americans have opened a water communication between the Penobscot, which falls into the Atlantic, and the Allagash, which falls into the St. John, the produce of a very extensive tract of country may find its way hither duty free, under the stipulations of this treaty. Those, I say, who think that import duties ought to be abolished, and that the whole revenue should be raised by direct taxes upon land, and upon accumulated capital, will, of course, not disapprove of these arrangements. But I do not hold those opinions; and, however anxious I am for a more extended commerce between this country and the United States, I do not see why American produce should be imported into this country duty free, and why we should make this unnecessary sacrifice of revenue which we want. As to the district which we cede at the head of the Connecticut, it might or it might not have been wise to give that up; but at all events, we ought to have had something for it. It was one of the elements of negotiation, and ought not to have been thrown away. As to the strip of land along the 45deg parallel, that was certainly a matter of no great importance to us, but a thing of much value to the United States, because chiefly peopled by their own citizens; it was clearly ours, but the surrender of this might have obtained for us some valuable concessions in return. But Rouse's Point was of some importance, and ought not lightly to have been abandoned. It is quite true that when the late Government consented to accept the award of the King of the Netherlands, they agreed to  1199 that part of his award which gave Rouse's Point to the United States; and it was one of the sacrifices we were prepared to make to good faith, and a wish for peace. But, at that time, the attention of the British Government had not been so strongly drawn to the military importance of Rouse's Point as it has been since; we were not then as well aware as now, of the value which military men attach to that position. Upon this subject, I need only remind the Government of certain military reports upon the defences of Canada, dated in 1840 and 1841, which they have in their possession, which were drawn up by persons whose authority on such matters they will not, I am sure, dispute; and which explain the great importance of commanding the outlet of Lake Champlain. These reports quote certain other reports made by United States officers, and published by Congress, pointing out that Lake Champlain, which runs deep into the United States, is the best quarter for assembing a force to invade Canada; and that the River Richelieu which runs from Lake Champlain into the St. Lawrence is the readiest road by which such a force could invade our provinces; and that to facilitate such an invasion, or to protect themselves against invasion by us, it was of great importance that they should have the command of the northern outlet of Lake Champlain. Those United States officers add:  ""The military consequences of the occupation of the outlet of Lake Champlain are so obvious, that it must not be supposed they are not perfectly understood by our neighbours across the border."" But the outlet of Lake Champlain is commanded by Rouse's Point; and I will venture to predict that now that Rouse's Point is ceded to the United States, we shall one of these days have submitted to us a proposal, for which I shall probably vote, to allot a large sum of money for the construction of some citadel further down the Richelieu, perhaps near the Isle aux Noix, to counteract and keep in check the United States fortress on Rouse's Point. Now, even if the present Government had thought that the importance of Rouse's Point has been exaggerated by military authorities, and that Canada can be well defended without it, still it was a possession much valued by the United States, and which ought not to have been abandoned without some corresponding 1200 equivalent. As to St. George's Island and the Mineral district, they have little or no political importance, and can only be regarded as representing so much value. In this point of view I do not grudge the United States these acquisitions of territory, though one might have thought that with their vast un peopled regions, they have already territory enough; but still, I do not see why, in an arrangement between equal powers, the gain is to be all on one side and the loss all on the other. But, after all, is this boundary entirely settled? I do not think it is. For one portion of the boundary is to be settled by the application of the fashionable principle of a sliding-scale. Yes, literally, one portion of this boundary is to be determined by a scale, which is to slide up and down the northern branch of the St. John, till a point is found, which shall be so many miles from one spot, and so many from another spot which still remains to be discovered. The words of the Treaty are these:  ""From the outlet of Lake Poyenagamook the boundary shall go south-westerly in a straight line to a point on the north-west branch of the river St. John, which point shall be ten miles distant from the main branch of the St. John in a straight line, and in the nearest direction; but if the said point shall be found to be less than seven miles from the nearest point of the summit or crest of the highlands that divide those rivers that empty themselves into the St. Lawrence from those that fall into the River St. John, then the said point shall be made to recede down the said north-west branch of the River St. John to a point seven miles in a straight line from the said summit or crest."" This might really serve for a Christmas puzzle. I only hope that the sliding-scale will produce more satisfactory results when applied to our geographical relations with the United States, than it has in our commercial relations with them. These then are my objections to this part of the treaty which relates to the Boundary Question. I think the negotiation was unskilfully conducted; that we took too low a ground; that we treated upon an unfair basis; that we threw away concessions which ought to have been employed to procure for us better terms; and that the interests, rights, and dignity of the country have been unnecessarily sacrificed. I now come to anther part of this treaty, which has reference to another subject, still more interesting than that of the boundary, because  1201 it involves higher considerations, and concerns not merely one province or one nation, but principles of universal application, and affecting the whole of the human race. I allude to articles 8 and 9, which relate to the slave-trade. I am sorry to say, that since the present Government came into power we have made great strides backwards in all that relates to slavery and the slave-trade. One great stride is this Washington treaty, by which we virtually and formally accept from the United States a most inadequate, a most incomplete, I will not say valueless, be cause some value it certainly has but certainly a most insufficient engagement instead of a fulfilment of that article of the treaty of Ghent, by which the United States bound themselves to use their best endeavours to abolish the slave-trade. The tenth article of the treaty of Ghent, between Great Britain and the United States, says, that ""Whereas the traffic in slaves is irreconcilable with the principles of humanity and justice, and whereas both his Majesty and the United States are desirous of continuing their efforts to promote its entire abolition, it is hereby agreed that both the contracting parties shall use their best endeavours to accomplish so desirable an object."" Now no man can say that the eighth and ninth articles of the treaty of Washington are a fulfilment of this promise of the United States to use their best endeavours to accomplish the entire abolition of the slave-trade. Another great step backward that has been made in regard to the abolition of the slave-trade since the present Government came into office was the refusal of the French Government to ratify the treaty of the 21st December, 1841, for the mutual right of search, which had been concluded between England, France, Austria, Prussia, and Russia. The history of that treaty is well known to this House. It is shortly this. In 1831 and 1833, the British government concluded with that of France treaties giving the mutual right of search for the suppression of the Slave Trade. England had long known and felt that the mutual right of search was indispensably necessary for the suppression of the Slave Trade. It is indeed but too true, that as long as the condition of slavery anywhere exists, the Slave trade cannot be entirely nor permanently extinguished, because there will always be a great temptation to 1202 carry slaves to those countries where slaves may be bought and sold; and nothing can completely put an end to the Slave trade, but the universal abolition of slavery itself. But even during the continued existence of slavery, we may greatly keep down the slave trade, and reduce it within infinitely narrow limits by an active and watchful police on the sea. But such a police cannot be exercised without a mutual right of search; and that mutual right of search will be ineffectual and liable to be eluded, until it shall have been consented to by treaty by every state that has a flag flying on the ocean. And this you may depend upon, that in every country, be that country which it may, in every country where a clamor is raised against the mutual right of search for the suppression of the slave trade, at the bottom you will find, as the instigators of that clamor some slave trading or slave holding interest. Of this there cannot be the slightest doubt. Now the late Government felt the great importance of getting all the naval powers and states of Christendom to unite in a general league for the suppression of the slave trade; and immediately on coming into office, we addressed ourselves to France, and obtained from her the treaties of 1831 and 1833 which were greatly to the honour of both countries; and the effect of those treaties was, to put an end at once to the slave trade, which, up to that time, had been carried on under the French flag. England and France then addressed themselves to Austria, Prussia, and Russia, and requested those powers to accede to the treaties of 1831 and 1833; and there being among the subjects of those powers no slave traders or slave holders; and the governments being therefore free from the sway of any sinister influences; they most readily agreed to join with England and France in our endeavours to accomplish the great object we had at heart. As a matter of international etiquette, however, these three powers declined acceding to the previously concluded treaties between England and France, but said that they were perfectly willing to conclude, as original contracting parties, a new treaty with England and France, of the same nature and effect. There could, of course, be no objection to this proposal, and it was agreed to by England and France. The English Government thought this a favourable op-  1203 portunity for making some slight improvement in the treaty which had been concluded with France; the principal one was an extension of the geographical limits, within which the right of search was to be exercised according to the treaty with France. Those limits were narrow, and although they had been found sufficient for the extinction of the French slave trade, we thought it would be better to enlarge them, in a treaty which was intended to prevent the slave traders of Spain and Portugal, and of Brazil, from seeking shelter and protection under the flags of Austria, Prussia, and Russia. We therefore proposed to insert in this new treaty the wider limits which are specified in our treaties with the Netherlands and with Spain. After a good deal of negotiation about matters of detail, all the parties had come to an understanding, and the treaty was pretty near ready for signature, when there arose the unfortunate differences between France and the other four powers about the affairs of Syria. Of course, while those differences lasted, we could not ask the French government to sign this slave trade treaty. But on the 13th July, 1841, France signed the treaty of the Dardanelles with England, Austria, Prussia, Russia, and Turkey, that is to say, with the very same powers who had been parties to the treaty of the 15th July, 1840, the original cause of her irritation. This treaty of the Dardanelles was one of much political importance, but especially so at that moment, as being a token and a public announcement of the reconciliation of France with the five powers who had engaged in the treaty of the 15th July, 1840. Before we left the room, after signing that Dardanelles treaty, I asked the French plenipotentiary if he was then ready to sign the slave trade treaty which had been so long delayed. He told me, that not being ambassador, but only charge d'affaires, his authority to sign the Dardanelles treaty had been special, and confined to that treaty alone, and he had therefore no power to sign the other. I begged him to apply to his government for such power, and he said he would. After a time the answer of his government came; and it was, that in the usual course of office the draft of treaty had been referred to the Marine department; that there were still some forms of routine to be gone through in regard to it; and 1204 that till those formalities were complete, which might still take some weeks, the authority to sign could not be sent. Of course we saw that this was a civil way of declining to sign that treaty at that time, and we naturally concluded that the signature of that slave trade treaty was reserved as a compliment to our approaching successors. This suspicion of ours has since been confirmed by an official declaration in the French Chambers, that the French government had declined, under the influence of personal feeling to sign the slave trade treaty with the British ministers who had been the authors of the treaty of the 15th July, 1840. It is always unfortunate when personal feeling is allowed to sway national affairs; and if the French government had not given way to personal feeling on that occasion, they might, perhaps, have avoided much embarrassment which they have had to contend with since; because, if they had signed that treaty then, the ratifications would have been exchanged within two months afterwards, and thus the transaction would have been completed long before the French chambers met, and no Parliamentary opposition could have been raised up to interfere with the ratification of the treaty. It is also still more to be regretted that this personal feeling should have prevented the French government from signing a treaty which had no political objects in view, which was to confer no advantage on Great Britain, and which was only destined to promote the cause of humanity, and to put an end to a great crime; while that same personal feeling did not prevent them from signing the other treaty which I have mentioned, which was purely of a political nature, and which however important, must on that account be considered as standing on much lower grounds than the one which they declined to sign. Seeing what the French government meant, we of course acquiesced. There was indeed no refusual to sign, but we saw that the delay would continue till our successors came into office. All we wished was that the slave trade should be put down. It would no doubt have been gratifying to us, if we, who had negotiated this business, and had brought it to a conclusion, could have seen it finally disposed of in our own time. But we satisfied ourselves with the hope and belief that the treaty would immediately be signed by our successors; and that by the end of  1205 September or the beginning of October, the matter would be concluded. What then was our astonishment to find when the treaty was laid on the Table, that it had not been signed till the 21st of December. I know too well how overwhelming are the duties of the Foreign-office at all times, and more especially during the first few months after a new administration has come in, to impute any blame to the Government for this delay; it would be unfair and un candid to do so. The cause of the delay may have been elsewhere, but even if it arose from oversight on the part of the Government here, they could not be expected to foresee that in consequence of the delay the French government could refuse to ratify a treaty which France herself had concurred to propose. But the treaty not having been signed till the 21st of December, the French chambers met before the expiration of the two months allowed for ratification; and then was got up a clamour against the treaty, avowedly excited, in a great degree by the American minister at Paris; and this led to the circumstance on which the French government founded their refusal to ratify the treaty. That circumstance was an address from the French chamber to the Crown, not praying the Crown to withhold its ratification, but expressing a hope that in the execution of the treaty, due care would be taken of the rights and interests of France. Now as a treaty cannot be executed until it is ratified; this address actually assumed that the treaty would be ratified by the French government. Upon this address however, the French government founded their refusal to ratify, but as we had been told by the Government of France that the British Government made no complaint or remonstrance whatever on this matter, we must suppose that they were satisfied that the French government had some good reason for its refusal, and upon that matter I will not now give my opinion. But I cannot refrain from noticing a new doctrine of international law which which has lately been promulgated on this subject in France, and by high authority; and which being founded in error, tends, I think, to shake that confidence which ought to exist between governments. It has been publicly asserted that a sovereign may justly refuse to ratify a treaty signed on his behalf by a duly authorised and duly instructed Plenipotentiary, if after 1206 the signature of that treaty, such sovereign should find that it clashes with the interests or the wishes of his subjects; and in support of that doctrine it has been asserted, that it was acted upon recently by the king of the Netherlands, who it was alleged, refused to ratify a treaty which had been signed by his plenipotentiary with a plenipotentiary of the king of Prussia. Now I apprehend that all the best writers on the law of nations concur in stating that there are but two grounds on which a sovereign can properly refuse to ratify a treaty which has been signed by his plenipotentiary; the one is that the plenipotentiary signed without instructions; the other that in signing he violated or exceeded his instructions. But neither of these reasons can be assigned by the French government in this case. Then as to the Commercial Treaty about Luxemburgh, between Prussia and the Netherlands, the assumed non-ratification of which has been quoted by the French government as a precedent for their refusal to ratify the Slave-trade Treaty, I have been informed, by what I consider good authority, that they are entirely mistaken in that case. The King of the Netherlands did indeed at first demur about ratifying that treaty, in consequence of some dissatisfaction in regard to it, expressed by his Luxemburgh subjects: but ultimately he did ratify it, and just as it had been signed, and without any alterations or modifications whatever. The doctrine therefore is unsound, and the example does not bear it out. But whether the French government were or were not justified in refusing to ratify the slave-trade treaty of December 1841, their having refused to do so, is a great stride backwards in regard to the suppression of the slave-trade, and I will shortly explain to the House why. It is well known, that for several years past, the United States government has persisted in refusing to agree to any treaty with England for the mutual right of search for the suppression of the slave-trade. This, indeed, was not always the case; there was a time when they were willing to do so. In 1824, they themselves proposed to England and France a treaty for the mutual right of search. They actually concluded with England a treaty to that effect, and as the House well knows, the only reason why that treaty did not come into operation was,  1207 that upon ratifying it (for they ratified as well as signed it) they inserted some restriction as to the geographical limits of the right of search, and the British Government, not choosing to acquiesce in alterations made in a treaty by means of a ratification, refused to ratify the treaty which had been so altered. The British Government, moreover, may have thought that the alteration would tend to impair the efficiency of the treaty. Perhaps it was unfortunate that we did not get over this objection; but so it was, that up to that time the Americans were anxious faithfully to fulfil the obligations which they had undertaken by the treaty of Ghent. Of late years, the increased exertions in this country for the suppression of the slave-trade, coupled with the abolition of slavery in our colonies, have created an alarm in the slave-holding States of the Union, and public opinion there has undergone a change. National jealousy has been artfully roused, and a strong repugnance has been expressed to the mutual right of search. But the late Government intended, whenever the treaty between the Five Powers should have been completed, to have proposed to the other Four Powers, that the five should go in a body to the United States, and request them to accede to that treaty; and if England, France, Austria, Prussia and Russia, the five greatest powers of Europe, including three of the greatest naval powers of the world, had agreed to this treaty, and had gone to the United States, saying, that to put an end to a great crime which disgraces mankind, they had forgot all differences, and had laid aside all rival ship and petty jealousies; that they entreated the United States, in the name of all that was good, to join them, and to do at their urgent request now, that which the United States had themselves been spontaneously anxious to do in 1824; if this step could have been taken, I will not venture to assert that such an appeal must necessarily have been successful, but I am sure that it must have had great weight with the United States, and that much good must have resulted there from. The Americans themselves saw the matter in that light. General Cass, at Paris, saw it in that light; and it was in consequence of his so viewing it, that, as American envoy at Paris, he made those exertions which led to the refusal of the French Government to ratify the 1208 treaty, and thus prevented the Five Powers from asking the United States to accede to the treaty. There can be no doubt that by this event the cause has lost much ground, which I fear it will be difficult to recover. This, then, was a great step backwards in regard to the suppression of the slave-trade, and no less a step backwards was the treaty of Washington. All the world has so regarded it; France in particular so regards it. She immediately declared, that if England is satisfied with such an engagement from America as is contained in this treaty, she ought not to demand more from France. ""Why,"" exclaim the French, ""does England expect that our merchantmen should be subjected to the right of search, when vessels sailing under the American ensign are placed by special treaty on a different footing? The United States are as much bound by treaty as we are, to put down the slave-trade. Why should one kind of fulfilment of that obligation be accepted from them, and a different one be required from us?"" These arguments are indeed easy to refute, but they have been vehemently urged, and the effect of the Washington treaty has been not only to make an injurious concession to America, but to involve us in difficulties with France. But this is not all; another step backwards is the letter which was addressed last year by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to the Lords of the Admiralty, about the destruction of slave factories on the coast of Africa. It is well known, that the way in which the Spanish, Portuguese, and Brazilian slave-trading pirates carry on their traffic is this: they settle them selves on the coast, not within any colony belonging to any European power, but on the territory of some small independent chief. There they build storehouses, and what are called barracoons. The store houses are to hold the goods by which they purchase slaves; the barracoons are to hold the slaves so purchased; and these buildings are constructed to hold many hundreds at a time. These establishments are defended with cannon, and garrisoned by well armed men. The native chiefs are overawed by superior force, or bribed by the profit which the slave-trade holds out to them; and thus these slave-traders carry on their traffic with security. Their mode of proceeding is this: the resident agent collects a number of slaves from the native merchants who  1209 bring them from the interior, and the slaves so collected are kept confined in the barracoon till the vessel arrives which is intended to carry them away. The vessel is sent out from Cuba or Brazil, or from some other place, laden with the goods which are to be given in payment for the slaves. She arrives off the place where the barracoon is; the cargo is landed and stowed away in the store-houses; the slaves are embarked and stowed away in the hold; a few hours are sufficient for this operation; and away goes the vessel, with a fair chance, by the rapidity of the process, of escaping the vigilance of our cruizers. It has been found by experience that one of the best ways of checking the slave-trade is to destroy these factories. This was first done by Lieut. Denman, in consequence of his boats having been fired at by the garrison of one of these establishments. He acted on that occasion on the spur of the moment, and without previous instructions; but his conduct was approved of, and he was rewarded by promotion for his zeal and activity. Afterwards instructions were sent out to our cruizers on the coast of Africa to do the same thing where ever it could be effected. The way it was done was this: We landed with the consent of the chiefs, burned the barracoons, and carried off the slaves for emancipation, leaving the chiefs to do what they liked with the contents of the storehouses. Thus all parties were satisfied except the slave traders. We had the gratification of performing an act of humanity, the negroes obtained their freedom, and the chiefs carried off the blue baft, and paid themselves the debts due to them by the slave traders. But the noble Lord at the head of the Foreign Office, wrote a letter to the Admiralty last year, which has been generally understood by persons who take an interest in these matters, as intended to condemn our proceedings, and to forbid a repetition of them. For my part, I own I do not so understand the letter; for it does not seem to me in reality to rescind the instructions of the late Government. But, though it does not forbid a repetition of our proceedings, it appears to cast blame upon them, and thus it is calculated to give encouragement to the slave traders. I hope, that before the close of this debate we shall have some explanation on this point from some Member of the Government, and that we shall be assured that 1210 measures of this kind, which are so effectual for the suppression of the slave-trade will not be discontinued. These, then, are three great strides which we have made backwards in regard to the suppression of the slave-trade, and I have witnessed them with great regret. An objection connected with this subject has been raised by many to the 10th Article of the Washington treaty, which relates to the mutual surrender of persons charged with criminal offences, and who may have fled from the one country to the other. It is feared that this article will enable American slave holders to recover fugitive slaves who have made their escape to the British provinces, and who when there, by our law become free. It is thought that such slaves will be charged with the offence of robbery, upon the pretence that they have stolen either the clothes on their back, or the means used for their escape; or else that they will be accused upon false affidavits, of crimes which they never committed, and that once delivered up on such charges they will be again consigned to slavery. I own I do not share in these apprehensions; I am persuaded that matters will be so ordered by her Majesty's Government, that no such evasion of the clear intent and obvious meaning of the treaty shall be permitted. But while adverting to this matter, I cannot help observing upon the correspondence between Lord Ashburton and Mr. Webster on the subject of the Creole, which I have read with great regret. Mr. Webster, in his letter, lays down the doctrine that an American merchant ship is American territory, and is to be treated and respected as such, let her go where she will; that whatever foreign port she may enter, she carries thither all the immunities of the American soil, is protected by all the peculiarities of the American law, and remains exclusively subject to its jurisdiction. That slaves embarked in such ships continued to be American property even in a British port, and ought not when there to be set free, by the operation of the British law; and Mr. Webster calls on Lord Ashburton to engage that the British Government shall instruct its colonial authorities not to exercise what he calls an officious interference with regard to slaves on board American ships driven by stress of weather, or other causes into a British port. That is to say, not to give to such slaves the protection which the law of  1211 England gives them a right to claim. And Mr. Webster intimates that the practice of setting free, by the operation of British law, American slaves found in an United States ship, which may be driven by stress of weather into a British port, will be ""a dangerous source of future collisions."" Lord Ashburton in his reply gives but too much countenance to the doctrines laid down by Mr. Webster, and enters into an engagement on the part of his Government, that instructions shall be given to the governors of the British Colonies, that no such officious interference as that complained of, shall in future take place. That is to say, he virtually promises that American slaves, confined in American ships, driven by stress of weather into a British port, shall not be meddled with. But I say it is not for the American and British Governments, but for the law of England, to determine how slaves entering a British port shall be treated. The noble Lord appears to have bound himself that Mr. Webster's demands should be complied with; but Mr. Webster's demand was, that American negro slaves should be considered as American chattel property, and should be treated in a British port in the same manner in which they would be treated in an American' port. This was set ting aside in British ports the operation of British law, which, finding slaves within its authority, restores them to liberty without regard to their roasters. But our Plenipotentiary seems on this occasion to have forgotten what had previously passed on this subject, as well as the bearing of the law of England on the matters which he was discussing. The principle put forward by Mr. Webster in the case of the Creole had been argued by the two Governments before. The House will find in the miscellaneous estimates of 1839, some papers on which a sum of money was voted as compensation to American citizens for the loss of slaves set free in British colonies; and in those papers will be seen a statement of the doctrine maintained by the British Government on the subject in question. The cases were those of three American ships, the Comet, Encomium, and Enterprize, employed in transporting slaves from one port of the United States to another. The two first were wrecked on the Bahamas, and the crews and slaves were carried to Nassau, where the slaves were set free. This happened before slavery was abolished in our colonies. The 1212 third ship, the Enterprize, was driven by stress of weather into Bermuda, in February, 1835, after slavery had been abolished in our colonies by law. The authorities of the island interfered, whether of their own accord, or being called upon to do so, I am not sure. They took the slaves away from the illegal confinement in which they were held in the vessel, and set them free. The United States government applied to that of Great Britain for compensation in these three cases, for the owners of the negroes, on account of the loss they had sustained by the emancipation of their slaves. Now what was the answer given by the British Government? In regard to the two first cases we said, that the vessels had been wrecked, and the slaves had been liberated on British ground, while slavery was still lawful in the British colonies, and slaves were then legal property in our colonies as well as in the United States. The claimants, therefore, were lawfully possessed of their property within our colony, and having been deprived of that property by the act of the British authorities, they were entitled to compensation. But with regard to the Enterprize we said the case was different; when that vessel entered Bermuda, slavery had been abolished through out the British dominions. No man, who there English or American, could at that time be lawfully possessed of any slave in a British territory. The applicants there fore laid claim to property which our law did not recognise. That property we taken from them by the legitimate interference of our colonial authorities, and, therefore, we refused compensation. But more than that, we informed the United States government, that the same principle would always thenceforward be acted upon; and that in any case of the same kind, in which American slaves should be set free in a British colony, no compensation could be granted. And did we give that answer upon our own judgment and responsibility? No; we took the opinion of the law advisers of the Crown, and we framed our answer according to that opinion. The report which we received from them, and which I will quote, says  ""In the former cases (that is to say in the cases of the Comet and Encomium), the owners were lawfully in possession of their property with in a British port, and were disturbed in their possession of them by a British functionary. But not so, in the case of the Enter-  1213 prize; because slavery had then been abolished throughout the British empire. The property of an owner would continue when the ship containing that property is driven by stress of weather into any foreign port; and the owner would be aggrieved were he to be deprived of what belonged to him by the municipal law of the state, to which he had not voluntarily submitted himself. But slaves are human beings; (a fact which our Plenipotentiary seems to have forgotten), and are to be heard before their fate is decided upon. Here there are three parties to the transaction; and those who before were slaves, when they come into a country where slavery is unknown and forbidden, are instantly in the situation of aliens who have always been free. They can in no shape be restrained of their liberty by their former master, any more than by a mere stranger. If they were given up to him they would be aggrieved, and would be entitled to sue for damages. But it would be absurd to say, that when a state prohibits slavery, then as often as a slave-ship takes refuge in one of its ports, a liability must be incurred either to the owner of the slaves if they be liberated, or to the slaves if they be given up. Where slavery is prohibited, the law of nations cannot be considered as violated by the municipal law, on the slaves being liberated; according to the law there is no wrong, and there shall be no compensation, slavery being now abolished throughout the British empire, there can be no well-founded claim for compensation in respect to the liberation of slaves, who may come under any circumstances into the colonies, any more than into the mother country"" But Lord Ashburton did not take this ground; on the contrary, I find he says in his letter of August 7th, 1842, to Mr. Webster,  ""Our object is rather to look to the means of future prevention of such occurrences."" Those occurrences being the liberation of American slaves in a British port, by the operation of the British law. ""That this may be attained I have little doubt, although we may not be able immediately to agree upon the precise stipulations of a treaty, on the part of Great Britain; there are certain great principles too deeply rooted in the consciences and sympathies of the people for any Minister to be able to overlook, and any engagement I might make in opposition to them, would be instantly disavowed. But at the same time that we maintain our own laws within our own territories, we are bound to respect those of our neighbours, and to listen to every possible suggestion of means of averting from them every annoyance and injury. I have great confidence that this may be effectually done in the present instance; but the case to be met and remedied is new, and must not be too hastily dealt with. You may, however, be 1214 assured, that measures so important for the preservation of friendly intercourse between the two countries shall not he neglected. In the mean time, I can engage that instructions shall be given to the Governors of her Majesty's colonies on the southern borders of the United States, to execute their own laws with careful attention to the wish of their Government to maintain good neighbourhood; and that there shall be no officious interference with American vessels, driven by accident, or unlawful violence, into those ports. The laws and duties of hospitality shall be executed, and these seem neither to require nor to justify any further inquisition into the state of persons or things on board of vessels so situated, than may be indispensable, to enforce the observance of the municipal law of the colony, and the proper regulations of its harbours and waters."" [Cheers.] Yes, I understand that cheer, it relates to the expression, ""the municipal law of the colony."" I will advert to that in a moment. Mr. Webster accepts the engagement of our plenipotentiary as a promise that hereafter there shall be no ""officious interference"" of our colonial authorities to set free slaves, confined in American ships, driven by stress of weather, or other causes, into a British port; and he adds, that  ""He indulges the hope, that actuated by a just sense of what is due to the mutual interests of the two countries, and the maintenance of a permanent peace between them, her Majesty's Government, will not fail to see the importance of removing, by such further stipulations, by treaty, or otherwise, as may be found necessary, all cause of complaint connected with this subject."" Now, I quite understand the cheer which I heard just now. It meant that Lord Ashburton, in fact, did not promise what Mr. Webster wanted, because he made a reservation, that our colonial authorities were to inquire into the state of persons and things on board of American ships so driven into our ports, as far as may be necessary for the observance of the municipal law of the colony, and Gentlemen opposite meant to imply that which is perfectly true, that such municipal law requires, that on application for a writ of habeas corpus being made, all the slaves in such ships shall be set free. But did our plenipotentiary mean this? Certainly not; he was evidently not aware of the force of the words he was using, and by municipal law he must have meant rules of police, and port regulations; and it was clearly in that sense that Mr. Webster accepted his engagement. If,  1215 indeed, our plenipotentiary attached to the words ""municipal law of the colony,"" the same meaning which is applied to them by Gentlemen opposite who cheered me just now, and if he was aware that that law would set the slaves free, then the noble Lord was employing words which Mr. Webster was to understand in America in one sense, and which the noble Lord was to construe in England in a sense exactly opposite; and he was sheltering himself under a quibble unworthy of a British Minister; but I am convinced that this was not the case. I do hope and trust, however, that the Government will this night put upon those words their true and proper construction, and tell this House boldly and manfully, that they hold negroes within British jurisdiction to be as much entitled to the rights of hospitality, as the masters who were their owners before they entered our ports; and I trust we shall hear that our colonial authorities have been instructed to continue to exercise what the Americans are pleased to call an officious interference; and that no slave will enter a British port, whether in a colony or in the mother country, for the law is now the same in both, without being immediately set free. An American slave-owner ought to feel that if his slave-ship enters a British port, it is to him, as far as his slave property is concerned, as if she had foundered at sea; excepting only that he will have the consolation to think that his ship and his crew are safe, and that his slaves, instead of having perished by a miserable death, have entered, as it were, upon a new life of freedom and civilization. In fact, it is not possible to tell our colonial authorities what Mr. Webster asks, for it would be to tell them not to execute the law. I hope, therefore, to hear from her Majesty's Government that they have no intention of entering into any such stipulations as Mr. Webster appears to expect, and that they will maintain, without evasion or reservation, the ground on which the late Government took its stand in regard to the case of the Enterprize. I can only say, that if they depart from that ground, it will, in my opinion, be exceedingly disgraceful to the British name. Well, then, Sir, these are my objections to this treaty. But we are told by its defenders, that bad as it is, it has, nevertheless settled all disputes, and insured henceforward perpetual sunshine, and undisturbed peace, har- 1216 mony, and good-will, between the two countries. Why, Sir, but a few weeks had elapsed after the signature of the treaty, when a very different story was told to our plenipotentiary himself. Before he left the American shore, he attended two dinners, the one at Boston, the other at New York; at these dinners, while the roofs were ringing with the triumphant shout of the exulting assembly, who felt as Americans, that they had gained a great diplomatic victory over our negotiator; in the midst of the vociferous acclamations with which the announcement of the treaty was received, our plenipotentiary was bid to remember, that all questions between the two countries were not settled; that there still remained great and important points of difference; and he was plainly and distinctly admonished, that firm and lasting peace must not be expected, unless all those other questions were settled in the same spirit as the Boundary Question, that is to say, by complete concession on the part of England to the demands and pretensions of the United States. And has nothing else occurred to the same effect? When Parliament met, the right hon. Baronet was asked whether he acquiesced in the interpretation which the President of the United States, in his recent message to Congress, bad put upon the effect of the Treaty of Washington, as to the differences which had arisen between the two countries, in regard to the right of ascertaining the nationality of suspected vessels. In reply, the right hon. Baronet flatly contradicted the President; a proof that this Treaty has at least not hitherto succeeded in establishing a perfect understanding between the two Governments. Then there is another Boundary Question still unsettled, relative to what is called the Oregon Territory, on the banks of the Columbia River, on the west coast of North America: what has happened lately about that question? Why, the Senate have actually passed a bill for immediately taking forcible possession of the whole of that territory, and the Senator who brought in that bill, expressed his conviction that the American claim to this territory would immediately be acquiesced in by Great Britain, if it was only urged in what he was pleased to call a proper manner. It is impossible, I conceive, that this bill should pass the other  1217 branches of the legislature; but if it were to pass, and to be acted upon, it would be a declaration of war. It would be the invasion and seizure of a territory in dispute, by virtue of a decree made by one of the parties in its own favour. Thus, even before this vaunted Treaty, which was to settle all disputes, extinguish all differences, and secure perpetual peace, has come into operation, new differences have arisen, and old ones have been revived. A fresh proof how true it is that undue concessions, instead of securing peace, only increase the appetite for aggression; and depend upon it that if we go on submitting to every pretension of every foreign power, and conceding every thing which may be sternly demanded of us, we shall be driven at last to a point, at which war will become inevitable, but will be begun at a disadvantage. I have mentioned the public dinners which our Plenipotentiary attended at Boston and at New York; and I cannot quit the subject without expressing the pain and regret with which I read the language held by the noble Lord upon those occasions, coming as it did from a person holding a commission from the Crown, and addressed to an assembly of foreigners. The noble Lord spoke of Boston as ""the old cradle of American Liberty and Independence,"" and called it on that account, ""a hallowed spot."" I can understand a man, and should not be disposed to differ from him, who should say, that we were wrong in our quarrel with our North American provinces; that our war with them began in injustice, perhaps as great as the incapacity with which it was carried on; but no man can deny that the loss of those colonies was a great blow to the power of the British Empire, and that our feebleness in the war much lowered our military reputation. I can, however, comprehend a man who should say that he would rather that the power of the British Empire should have suffered the injury which the result of that American war inflicted on it, than that the British Constitution should have had to sustain the shock which would have been produced by the success of our illegal attempt. But such a preference could only be a choice of evils; and I cannot conceive that any Englishman can look back with satisfaction to that disgraceful period of our history, when we proved ourselves both weak and wrong. It ill becomes an Englishman to exult in the 1218 humiliation of his country, or to find a topic for triumph in her defeats; least of all, when addressing an assembly of foreigners, whose fathers gained the double victory of right and of might over our own; and when the person who so addresses them, still holds a high commission under the British Crown. I shall now conclude. I think I have shewn good grounds for asserting that the negotiations which led to this treaty were ill conducted, that the treaty is disadvantageous, and that if matters had been more judiciously managed, far better terms might have been obtained. But there the treaty is; it has been concluded, and has been ratified; and even if the ratifications had not yet been exchanged, ill as I think of the treaty, I would not wish the ratification to be with held; for I should be very sorry to see the Crown of England refuse to ratify a treaty which had been concluded by a duly authorised plenipotentiary. I know that many people think that this treaty will lay the foundation for permanent good-will and friendly feeling between the two nations. I wish it may do so; but I fear that by placing the United States in a better military position in regard to us than they occupied before, and by inducing them to think that we shall yield whenever they hold out, it will encourage them to press upon us unjust demands, and will afford them increased means of supporting such pretensions; and that thus, instead of securing peace, it will prove the source of new quarrels. I shall most sincerely rejoice if I am wrong, for sure I am that nothing could be more calamitous to both countries, than a war between Great Britain and the United States. I will endeavour to hope, however, that this truth may be felt in America as well as here, that the concessions we have now made, instead of rendering the United States more unreasonable in future, may incline them, through a sense of justice, to be more moderate on other matters; and that thus the expectations which the Government entertain of solid friendship between the two countries may be fully and amply realised."	257.0	1843.0	1840	[('right', 'right', ['positive', 'JJ']), ('mean', 'mean', ['negative', 'VB']), ('right', 'right', ['positive', 'JJ']), ('pretty', 'pretty', ['positive',

206508	206508	S3V0127P0-01904	1853-06-03	GOVERNMENT OF INDIA.	SIR CHARLES WOOD		"SIR CHARLES WOOD*: Mr. Speaker, I hope, Sir, considering the importance of the subject which it is now my duty to bring before the House, that I shall not be thought unreasonable if I ask for even more than the usual indulgence which on  1093 many former occasions it has been my good fortune to receive. I have had at various times to submit to the consideration of the House questions of considerable importance at one time, the state of the Navy of this country at another time, what I believed to be the whole state of Ireland at another, the condition of our West India Colonies and on different occasions the state of the finances of this country; but I never have had, and no man can have had for the last twenty years, to bring forward a question of such paramount importance as that of the whole state of our Indian empire not in one branch, but in all its branches and to explain every portion of the measure which I shall conclude by asking leave to introduce for the Government of India, and which is one affecting, either for weal or for woe, the destinies of 150,000,000 of our fellow creatures and our fellow subjects. It is no wonder, then, if I feel oppressed by the magnitude of the subject, and I fear that I shall find it impossible, however inadequately and imperfectly I may perform the task I have to discharge, not to trespass on the patience of the House for some considerable time. I have to meet also, first, that opposition which, from the threatenings that have exhibited themselves on former nights, I have reason to anticipate, arising out of a desire for delay in respect to legislation on this subject; and, in the second place, I cannot but anticipate opposition upon the substantive merits of the measure. I must deal separately with these two classes of objections, differing in their character, and to be met with different arguments. I trust, Sir, that the course of delay will not receive any general support in the House; but with respect to the second point I have referred to, I must, of course, expect a difference of opinion, knowing that very opposite views, and of a reasonable character, do exist on so important a subject. I have the satisfaction, however, of entertaining the most perfect confidence that no party feeling will be allowed to enter into the discussion of this mighty question. For differences of opinion for fair arguments in opposition to his own views, every man must be prepared; but the stake is so great, and the interests of our Indian empire are so vast, that I am certain, whatever differences of opinion may exist, that the discussion will not be allowed by any one to degenerate into a contest of party feeling, or to be embittered by party pint. 1094 Having said thus much by way of preface, I trust, looking to how many topics I must necessarily touch upon, that the House will permit me at once to address myself to the suggestion which has been made for delay in our legislation for India. The House is doubtless aware that the Act which at present provides for the government of India expires on the 30th of April next. It is, therefore, indispensably necessary to legislate in the course of the present Session. No one would risk the passing of an Act of this kind, considering the important business which usually occupies the beginning of a Session, by postponing legislation on such a subject till next year. There is no alternative, therefore, but to propose a measure providing for the future Government of India, or to adopt a course which has been suggested at different times namely, to pass a temporary continuing Bill, leaving for future discussion in the next Session of Parliament, any measure for more permanent legislation on the great question of the Government of India. Considering what we all must expect to take place in the course of next Session, such a course, I think, would be exceedingly unwise and unsafe. The right hon. Member for Buckinghamshire, I recollect, stated, as an objection to the present Act, that it was passed in the midst of the excited feeling which accompanied the Reform Bill, We must now bear in mind that the Government stands pledged to introduce a measure on that subject in the course of the next Session. Whatever that measure may be, it cannot but be one which will fully occupy the attention and interest of Parliament and of the country. What the state of our foreign relations then may be no man can tell: I know not that we can possibly look forward to a period of such quiet and tranquillity as we at present enjoy, in which there exist so few circumstances calculated to disturb the calm and deliberate consideration of this vast subject of the government of our Indian territory. It therefore seems to me not only desirable, but imperative on us, to avail ourselves of this most favourable opportunity of dealing with this great and important question; for, doubtless, no subject can well be more important, or so important, as the determination of the mode in which our Indian empire shall be in future governed. At the same time, the measure which I have to submit for your consideration is, so  1095 far as legislation goes, comprised in a very small compass. I may have much to state, and I should not he acting fairly by the House, if I did not explain the views of Her Majesty's Government on many questions not comprised in the Bill which I propose to bring in; but, I repeat, that so far as legislation is called for, the Bill will be small in compass, and, with trifling exceptions, confined to one subject only, namely, the form of the government of India at home and in India. That was the branch of the inquiry which my right hon. Friend opposite laid before the Committee last year as the first subject for their consideration namely,""the authorities and agencies for administering the government of India at home and in India respectively."" This subject was inquired into at considerable length by the Committees of both Houses last Session; and so far had that part of the inquiry been, I will not say actually, but apparently terminated, that at the commencement of the present Session the Committee of the House of Commons proceeded to the next head of inquiry; and my right hon. predecessor in the office which I now hold stated, on moving the reappointment of the Committee in November last, that it was his intention to propose to Parliament to legislate on the subject in the course of the present Session. We have heard in the course of the last few weeks four witnesses further on the matter. The evidence of two of them is already in the hands of the Members of this House, and the evidence of the other two was presented yesterday; but I do not think it at all necessary to wait till that evidence shall be delivered. Of course, before the Bill can possibly pass through the House, that evidence will be in our hands, and every Member will be in possession of as much information as the Committee possesses, and will be in a condition, therefore, to decide fully on all matters connected with this question. No person, I think, will deny that it is most inexpedient that any unnecessary delay should take place, and that so great a question as how our Indian empire is to be governed, should be left in a state of suspense even for a short period. Suspense in questions of Government cannot but be a source of evil. It becomes us therefore to see whether there is any argument in favour of delay so unanswerable that we are bound to incur the risk for that there is risk in delay, no man, I believe, denies. The arguments mostly relied upon in favour of 1096 postponement, though plausible, seem to me, I confess, to be utterly without foundation. We are told that, before we legislate, even with respect to the governing bodies for India, we must wait until we have concluded all the portions of our inquiry until we have terminated our investigation into the seven other heads, each of great importance, and branching out into various subjects, all requiring, at the rate at which our investigation has hitherto proceeded, no inconsiderable period for their completion. These, however, are not in general matters that require legislation here; but the greater part of them must necessarily be dealt with by measures cither of administration or of legislation in India. I have no wish or disposition to close the inquiry. I think that, for the information of this House and the country, and of the Government, both here and in India, it is desirable that our investigation should be proceeded with; but there is no reason, on this account, for postponing our legislation with respect to that matter on which our inquiry has been concluded, and on which legislation can now, and without difficulty, take place. If, before we legislate on the form of government for India, we are to investigate all the other subjects, and at our present rate of proceeding, I do not see what term there would probably be to the length of the inquiry, or when we should have a prospect of legislating at all. Certainly not for a period beyond that which any reasonable man has hitherto proposed for delay. The hon. Member for Knaresborough the other day urged delay on the ground that the inquiry into many branches was not completed; but I am sure he succeeded in convincing the House that he, at least, stood in no need of information on the matter to which he referred. He went, for instance, at some length into the military arrangements of India, adverted to the small number of officers with their regiments, and called for some amendments in the practice in that respect. It may be, and I believe is the case, that the number of officers with their regiments is constantly too small. That is a subject which, no doubt, requires looking into, and may call for the attention of the Commander-in-Chief or the Adjutant General; but it does not require legislation in this House. It may be necessary to send more officers to the regiments in India, or to withdraw fewer officers from them, when there; but that is a matter, I repeat, not requiring  1097 legislation in this House, but orders from the authorities regulating the military arrangements in India. The Committee has, this Session, inquired into the military branch of the subject, and then we proceeded to the next head, that of the judicial establishments, and the administration of justice. On this head most of the Members of the Committee thought we had taken sufficient evidence, and were satisfied to close the inquiry; but my hon. Friend behind me (Mr. Hume) told us that even then we were only on the threshold of that part of the subject. The House may judge, therefore, what prospect of legislation there would be, if it is to be postponed till the inquiries of the Committee are closed, and if these inquiries are to be conducted in the manner and at the rate recommended by those who are the principal advocates of delay. Again, it does not appear to me that any great advantage would be gained by waiting for evidence from India. I believe that with respect to the subjects which have now been inquired into, and which are the only matters introduced into the proposed Bill such, for instance, as the relations between the Board of Control and the Court of Directors, the constitution of the Court of Directors, or the abolition of that Court we are better able to decide than any witnesses who could be brought from India. On many topics, such as the want of public roads, and of irrigation, the tenure of land and the taxation in India, we might perhaps obtain further information from that country; but all these points have been brought before the Committee by witnesses already heard, or by representations laid before the Committee; and I do not sec that any new light or additional information is likely to be obtained, beyond what we have already got in substance, by waiting for fresh evidence from India. At any rate, the information, if any were so obtained, would have little or no bearing on the question which I have now to submit to the House; for, I repeat, those matters are subjects for legislation, or administration in India, and are not subjects which can possibly be settled by legislation in this House. The hon. Member for Poole has asked if Her Majesty's Ministers were prepared to deal with the question of the form of government for India, not being in possession of all the evidence which may be given to the Committee; but, if I am not mistaken, the India Reform Association, of which my hon. Friend is Chairman, has made up its 1098 own mind on this subject of the government of India, and has announced its intention to oppose any plan which is not founded on the basis of what is called ""single government,"" and which does not utterly put an end to the Court of Directors. They, then, require no further information, no further time, to enable them to come to a decision on this question. I do not object to that Association having made up its mind on this point; but, surely, the House, and Her Majesty's Government may also be allowed to have made up their minds; and I trust that, at least, the members of the India Reform Association will not urge any arguments in favour of delay. It seems to me, I must be permitted to say, that whatever plan for the government of India may be decided on whether""the single government"" should be adopted, or ""the double government"" should be continued or amended it is our bounden duty to give to India, at the earliest possible moment, the best government which the wisdom of Parliament can devise. Those who attribute more blame than I do to the past government of India, and who are of opinion that much that has been ill done, or altogether left undone, is to be attributed to the existing form of government, ought to be most anxious, at the earliest possible moment, to amend that form of government. Her Majesty's Ministers are prepared to lay before the House the plan of government which, in their judgment, is best calculated to promote the welfare and benefit of India, and also of this country, as inseparably connected with the welfare and prosperity of India. Amend it, if you will; alter it, if you please; suggest improvements, if you can; but let us not refuse to India, as soon as we can give it to her, the best government we can devise for her permanent welfare. In the opinion that we are not likely to obtain much additional information from India calculated to be of service in the present stage of our proceeding, I am' confirmed by the statement of a most intelligent witness, who appeared before the Committee a few days ago a gentleman who has resided the whole of his life in India, and is better acquainted than almost any one else with the feelings and habits of the people of India I mean Mr. Marshman. He stated to the Committee his opinion as follows:  ""For the arrangement of the general government of India, both abroad and at home, I think the Committee has received as much information  1099 as can be deemed necessary, and that nothing is to be gained by waiting for further light upon that subject. I do not think it is at all likely that by postponing legislation we should obtain further valuable information from India. I think that there can be no necessity whatever for waiting in the hope of obtaining further information from India."" Well, then, if there be no validity in the argument for delay in legislating on this subject, is there no danger in postponing legislation? I can only say that I have heard no persons connected with India express any other opinion on this point, but that, whatever we do, we ought to legislate as soon as we can. The gentleman to whom I have just referred states his opinion very clearly, ""that on many grounds it appears advisable to complete the arrangement in the course of the present year."" I have communicated with the Directors, the great majority of whom are connected with India, and the opinion they express is this Settle it as you will; abolish or deal with our Court as you please, but legislate in the course of the present Session; leave no uncertainty in India. But, what ought to be of far greater importance, is the opinion entertained by the Governor General of India, Lord Dalhousie, than whom no one has ruled India more successfully, or is better acquainted with that country. After a residence of five years in India, and when his rule is nearly expired, he is both a competent and a disinterested witness, and he says, that we ought by all means to conclude our legislation at once, and not to delay: that delay is a source of weakness, and weakness is a source of danger; and, that if the people of India begin to suspect that the rule in India is uncertain and tottering, and that Parliament has not made up its mind how India is to be governed, they may begin to suspect that the existing authorities may be set at nought. That is a risk which I think Parliament would be most unwise to run. In the evidence given by Lord Ellenborough before the Commons Committee, a somewhat parallel case is mentioned, exhibiting a striking instance of the danger, in dealing with native princes, likely to result from a supposed weakness in the governing power. Lord Ellenborough states, that when he was engaged in negotiations with the Government of Gwalior, a rumour respecting the probability of his recall had been circulated in India, and led to increased difficulty in the negotiations in which he was engaged, and to resistance to his demands. Under these 1100 circumstances, and with these views so strongly expressed by men to whose opinions the greatest weight ought to be attached, I think we should have been utterly unjustifiable if we had not, at the earliest possible period consistently with the progress of the other important measures which were already before the House, brought forward such a measure as we thought the best calculated to provide for the good government of India, and promote the welfare of our Indian subjects. There are certainly many reasons of convenience, looking to the time of the year and period of the Session, for delay; but such considerations as these could not for a moment be put into competition with the reasons which I have stated for proceeding at once with legislation on this subject, and I sincerely trust, that, at any rate, the great majority of the House will agree with us in this opinion. But, Sir, although I do not think that a minute and protracted inquiry into all the detail of the administration, and the state of every part of our Indian Empire is an indispensable preliminary to legislation on the subject of the government of India, I should not be doing my duty to the Indian Government, or dealing fairly towards the House, if I did not attempt to place before the House, as concisely as I can, what has been the result of the administration of India for the last twenty years. The Committee was appointed to inquire into the effect of the Act of 1833; and I fully admit, that if any great abuses were found to exist if any great crimes or delinquencies could be shown, such a circumstance might affect most materially the question we have to decide. It is due, then, to the House, that I should show, in general terms, how matters have been conducted in India, what progress has been made there during the last twenty years, and how far the governing powers have discharged the duty imposed on them by Parliament. But, in making this review, we must take care that it shall be a fair and impartial review. We must not judge of Indian progress by the English standard of the present day. That would be exceedingly unjust and unfair, as it would be unfair to judge of English progress some time ago by the standard which we adopt at the present moment for measuring our progress. In India we must make allowance for a difference of race and a difference of circumstances. We must look at India with somewhat of an Indian eye, and take into consideration all  1101 those circumstances which ought materially to affect our judgment in respect to Indian questions. In this country we know that there is every possible stimulus to active exertion both public and private public ambition, private rivalry, large capital, general education, and every motive which serves to make an energetic race urge on, in every way, and on all subjects, progressive improvement at a most rapid rate. No prejudices, no antiquated habits or customs are suffered to interfere. In India, on the contrary, you have a race of people slow to change, bound up by religious prejudices and antiquated customs. There are there, in fact, many, I had almost said all, the obstacles to rapid progress; whereas in this country there exist every stimulus and every motive to accelerate advancement. On nearly all subjects, too, I find there is the greatest difference between the various parts of India. That which is true of one part of the country, is almost sure to be untrue of another. For instance, with regard to the tenure of land, there are three or four different kinds of tenure, and those best acquainted with each invariably think that the one which they know best ought to be maintained and extended to every other part of India. We have had most contradictory evidence upon another topic the advantage or disadvantage of enlisting in the ranks of the Indian army the high caste or low caste Hindoos. We were told by one officer that nothing is so disadvantageous as the enlistment of high caste Hindoos, while another officer expressed his decided opinion that high caste Hindoos were invariably the best soldiers. We soon found, however, that one of these officers was in the Bengal army, and the other was in the Bombay army. The circumstances of the two services are quite different; and statements which seemed altogether contradictory were perfectly true, in consequence of the different positions of the two armies. This extreme diversity of circumstances and diversity of opinion renders any general conclusion almost totally impossible as to remedies for admitted evils. Besides this, it appears to me that no inconsiderable misapprehension exists as to the progress which India has made during the last twenty years. Petitions have been laid before Parliament documents professing to be the productions of native associations and one of them, to which my attention was called some time ago, and which has excited considerable notice, 1102 is a petition professing to emanate from the Native Association of Madras. I should certainly have thought any statements proceeding from intelligent and well informed natives of India, entitled to the most careful consideration; but I must say that I do not believe that this petition was either prepared or knowingly sanctioned by intelligent natives of Madras, who were acquainted with the actual state of things in that Presidency. The statements which it contains appeared to me to be of a very extraordinary nature, and the result of inquiries showed that there has seldom been such a tissue of exaggeration and misrepresentation. Those statements are utterly contradicted, not only by facts, but by documents to which the petition itself refers. For example, an enactment of the British Parliament in 1787, is dealt with as an Act of recent Indian legislation. A Report of 1837 is quoted as containing the last accounts with respect to irrigation in Madras. The petition also states that its promoters were unable to obtain official information upon certain subjects, which information is actually contained in published documents to which the petition itself refers. These misstatements were so important that I wrote to the Governor of Madras, requesting him to make some inquiries on the subject; and he informed me that the first intimation he had of the petition, was, from seeing complaints in the local newspapers that they had been unable to obtain a sight of the document. He also tells me that at Madras, where knowledge on the subjects referred to in the petition does exist, many of the statements contained in it are known to be so utterly untrue that they excite very little attention, and are treated with the utmost contempt, although here, in our ignorance of Indian matters, they are palmed upon us as of the greatest importance. Now, I am far from saying and I beg not to be misunderstood on this point that much has not been left undone that ought to have been done. I am far from saying that there have not been many sins, of omission rather than of commission, in the administration of affairs in India; but I think I shall be able to show the House that much has already been done, and that those to whom the administration of affairs on the spot has been entrusted the local officers in different parts of the country the Government in India, supported by the Government at home have not been neglectful of those great material and domestic  1103 intevests domestic I mean, so far as India is concerned which have been committed to their charge. The fact that more has not been done, is, I think, in no slight degree attributable to the unfortunate, the continual, and the expensive wars in which India has of late years been engaged. It is not for me now to express any opinion upon the policy and conduct of those wars; but this, no doubt, has been their inevitable result that means have been wanting to carry further than has been done the material improvement of India. The points upon which the greatest stress has been laid, and which are the heads of the complaints contained in the petitions presented to the Committee, relate to the administration of justice, the want of public works, and the tenure of land. I will proceed to deal with these matters in the order in which I have mentioned them. First, with regard to the administration of justice, the complaints relate principally to the inconvenience arising from the technicalities of English law, to the alleged incompetency of English judges, and to the corruption of the native judges and officers. So early as 1833 the difficulties of the state of the law in India were strongly felt, and provisions were introduced into the Act passed in that year which it was thought were likely to lead to an amendment of the law. Provision was made for the appointment of a Law Commission in India which was intended to prepare a code amending and consolidating the various laws and regulations in force in that country, and to establish, so far as circumstances would allow, one uniform common law for the different races of people who inhabit our territories. I am sorry to say that the result of the proceedings of that Commission has not answered the expectations which had been entertained. Principally under the care of my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh (Mr. Macaulay) a penal code was prepared, which was the first complete result of the labours of the Commission. It was submitted to the consideration of the various local authorities in India. This occupied a very considerable time, and the suggestions made by them had to be revised and reconsidered by the members of the Law Commission. The revised code was sent to this country. It was returned to India, with authority to enact it with such modifications as the Government of India thought expedient, but in the meantime my right hon. Friend had come home. Some years 1104 had elapsed since the code was framed. Another Legislative Councillor (Mr. Bethune) had been appointed; he disapproved of much of half of the draft of the code, revised it with different views, and substituted a draft, differing in very essential particulars from that of my right hon. Friend. The Governor General naturally thought that though he had authority to pass the one, it was beyond his competency to pass a totally altered code. He referred it to the Government at home, by which step some further delay was necessarily incurred; and, finally, authority was sent out to the Governor General to pass the code in whatever shape he thought best. In the meantime Mr. Bethune, who prepared the second code, had died in India, and the two drafts had therefore to be submitted to the revision of a third English lawyer who succeeded Mr. Bethune as Legislative Councillor at Calcutta. He (Mr. Peacock) is a man of high character, and who is no doubt perfectly competent to perform the task; but he was naturally, on his first arrival, ignorant of many of the habits and customs of the Hindoos and of other inhabitants of India, with which it was most desirable that a person performing such a duty should be acquainted. He is at present engaged in revising the two codes, and the Government of India has the requisite authority for enacting whatever it considers to be right; but owing to these unfortunate, though perhaps unavoidable, delays, no actual result in the shape of legislation has yet been attained. I believe, however, it will be found that the labours of the Commissioners have not been altogether useless, for in many of the Acts which have been subsequently passed by the Legislative Council, the spirit, if not the letter, of their recommendations has been complied with. So far, therefore, their labours have not been without benefit to India; and I shall state to the House, before I sit down, the measures we intend to propose with the view of bringing to a practical conclusion the investigations which have been carried on for some time into the matters of legal reform, and of giving to India at an early period the benefits of the consideration which the subject has received. With regard to the complaint of the technicalities of English law, I am afraid there is some truth in the allegation. We carried with us to India that attachment to our own laws, and to our own modes of proceeding, which distinguishes or rather  1105 did distinguish the courts of justice, and the lawyers of this country. These laws and proceedings were, however, perfect as Englishmen thought them, totally foreign to the habits and manners of the people of India; and it is remarkable that even now it is proposed by some of the Indian reformers, to establish a class of officers for conducting magisterial business, totally distinct from those who manage the revenue and other business; thus departing still more widely from the native habits and customs, which almost universally place all authority of this kind in the same hands. I am afraid that if we look into our own proceedings at home, we shall see that we have not much right to find fault with the mode in which these matters have been conducted in India. I have now been for more than twenty-five years a Member of this House, and one of the first Motions I heard submitted to Parliament was a proposal to reform the Courts of Chancery a reform which it has taken a quarter of a century to effect. When I cast my eye the other day over the report of the Law Commissioners, which has been recently presented to Parliament, I found in it a reference to two topics, the consideration of which had been recommended by a Law Commission which sat some twenty years ago, with regard to one of which no remedy has been yet provided, while the other was not dealt with until about two years ago. The one is the necessity of an unanimous verdict on the part of juries; and the other related to the admissibility of some descriptions of evidence, the exclusion of which has frequently tended in no inconsiderable degree to defeat the ends of justice. Probably many hon. Gentlemen may have seen a pamphlet written by a Mr. Norton on the administration of justice in India. No doubt Mr. Norton has succeeded in stringing together a number of decisions and results of trials which appear, as they stand, very absurd. [""Hear, hear!""] The Gentlemen who cheer as if this was a wonderful proof of the defects of the administration of justice in India, may perhaps be astonished when I tell them I have heard that one of the most eminent Judges in this country has declared his opinion, that if you were to take the criminal proceedings in this country from the first proceedings to the verdict of the jury, and the sentence ultimately inflicted under the authority of the Secretary of State, it would not be difficult to string together a tissue of absurdities equal to those contained in 1106 Mr. Norton's work. Why, it is not long since sentence of death was recorded in very numerous cases, although everybody knew that the sentence would not be carried into effect. How frequently have we found efforts made by individuals and associations to prove the innocence, and sometimes successfully, of criminals who had been convicted by the legal tribunals of the country? How often has it been necessary for the Secretary of State to pardon persons who had been convicted of offences when they ought to have been acquitted? I think, then, such cases as are mentioned in the work to which I refer, afford no very conclusive proof of the defective administration of justice in India. I would, however, ask hon. Gentlemen to consider the different circumstances in which Courts of Justice are placed in England and in India. Here for the most part truth is told in our Courts of Justice. The Judges are generally justified in believing the evidence given in court. There may be exceptions; no doubt there are; but no man will deny that, as a general and almost universal rule, the evidence given upon oath in our Courts is true, and not false. Is that the case in India? If you believe the evidence given before the Committee, directly the reverse is the case. The chances are that the evidence given in Indian courts is false, and not true. Is no allowance to be made, then, for judges administering the law, and attempting to dispense justice, under such circumstances? It seems to me that every allowance ought to be made, and that, instead of trying to depreciate the administration of justice, or to run down those who administer the law under such adverse circumstances, we ought to extend to them every possible indulgence; for, considering the circumstances in which they are placed, I think it is rather a matter of surprise that justice should be administered with any satisfaction, than that such charges as I have alluded to should be made. Perhaps the House may not be aware to what an extent falsehood, perjury, and subornation of perjury are said to be carried in India. I do not believe that the description can apply to the great body of the people of India; but as regards many of those who appear in the Courts of Justice, we have evidence of the strongest nature showing the prevalence of these crimes to an extent which, I confess, would be utterly incredible if the statements did not rest upon authority so general and so irreproachable. Dr. Duff, a  1107 Christian missionary, made this statement before the Committee:  ""It is the simple fact that scarcely a single case that goes to a Court in India goes there without bribery and without perjury on all sides. I mean literally what those words denote."" A gentleman of high authority, Mr. Baillie, a pleader for many years in the Courts in Bengal, both at Calcutta and up the country, was examined before the Commons Committee; and this, after long experience, is his opinion:  ""Oral evidence in a case is, generally speaking, plainly and palpably false. To express in the strongest way my own views, I may state that I was a pleader in the Sudder Dewanny Adawlut for twelve years. For a good many of those years I had a very large business, but I scarcely recollect an instance where I thought it worth while to comment upon the evidence at all."" Now, what says Mr. Norton, who complains so much of the administration of justice, as to the mode in which evidence is prepared, and the reliance to be placed upon it? He tells us:  ""Informing a native of a point which it is necessary for him to prove in order to substantiate his case, is almost tantamount to bidding him go into the bazaar, where witnesses to any fact may be procured at an anna (11/2d.) a head, and setting in motion all the secret springs of a complicated machinery of forgery and subornation of perjury."" It is then, I think, only right that a fair and full allowance should be made for the circumstances in which the judges are placed. Nor is this a new or temporary state of things, produced, as some people would have us believe, by the prevalence of English rule. I referred the other day to a charge delivered by Sir J. Mackintosh to the grand jury of Bombay many years ago, in the course of which he said  ""Such is the unfortunate prevalence of the crime of perjury, that the hope of impunity is not extinguished by the apprehension of the delinquent. I observe that Sir W. Jones, who carried with him to this country (India) a prejudice in favour of the natives, after long judicial experience reluctantly confesses their general depravity. The prevalence of perjury, which he strongly states, and which I have myself already observed, is perhaps a more certain sign of the general dissolution of moral principle than other more daring crimes. It is that crime which tends to secure the impunity of all other crimes; and it is the only crime which weakens the foundation of every right, by rendering the administration of justice, on which they all depend, difficult, and in many cases impossible."" The evidence of the difficulty to be encountered by an Englishman in the administration of justice increases upon us as we look further into the subject. The Madras petition mentions, as an instance 1108 of the maladministration of justice, the case of a man who was convicted before a Zillah judge, but who proved to be innocent. There certainly is no doubt of this fact having occurred; but the man had been convicted, in the first instance, not upon any evidence, but upon his own conviction. You will find, if you refer to the evidence given by Dr. Duff, that he states it is by no means uncommon for persons in India to confess themselves guilty of crimes of which they may be proved to be innocent; but is a judge to be blamed if he convicts a man upon his own confession? I think there is no reason to doubt that justice is fairly and impartially administered by English judges in India; and that, in reviewing their conduct, we ought to make allowance for the circumstances I have mentioned. It was stated that judges were placed upon the bench in India at a very early period of life; that young and raw Englishmen who had just arrived in India were made judges of appeals from the decisions of the native Courts. Sir Gr. Clerk, a gentleman well versed in the affairs of India, and who served for a long time in various parts of that country, distinctly stated that, so far as he knew, such could not be the case. It is, however, true that sometimes gentlemen of no long standing in the service, acting as assistant judges, to try such appeal cases as are assigned to them by the judge, that officer taking the important cases, and assigning the smaller ones to the assistant. The judges themselves are generally servants of twenty years standing or upwards. On referring to the Bengal judicial appointments, I find that the youngest judge on that bench has been twenty-two years in the service of the East India Company. Perhaps the most satisfactory evidence that can be laid before the House on this subject is that of persons who depose to the implicit confidence reposed by the natives in the English judges. It is shown by the decisive testimony of different persons that this is the almost unanimous feeling among the natives. No one who has appeared as a witness before the Committee appeared to be better acquainted with India, and with the Indian service, than Mr. Halliday; and he says:  ""As far as regards the integrity of the judges, the confidence of the natives is complete; they have little or no notion of the possibility of corrupting an English judge. I know from constant intercourse with the natives, from the very commencement of my service in India, down to a very recent period, that they look upon the incorrupti-  1109 bility of an Englishman, his truthfulness, and integrity generally, as something quite by itself."" Mr. Marshman informs us that  ""The general impression throughout the native community, with two or three exceptions, is that the English judges are absolutely incorruptible."" Mr. Baillie, the pleader to whom I before referred, says  ""The native has a general feeling against the honesty of all judges. I think that general feeling has given way entirely; and I think, as a general rule, the native believes that an English judge is usually honest."" Mr. Javenjee Pestonjee, a Parsee merchant from Bombay, says  ""There is no question about the integrity and the morality of the civil service. There are many civil servants who are quite competent and thoroughly understand the duties of their office; those oven who do not possess a knowledge of the law, are willing to discharge the duties of their office with impartiality."" It must be remembered that in this country we have one language and one law, while in India there are many languages and many laws. To each man in India, to the best of the judge's ability, is administered the law of his nation. The Mahomedan law is administered for the Mahomedan, the Hindoo law for the Hindoo, and for the natives of all parts of the world the law of their respective countries, so far as it can be ascertained, is administered; and the House will see at once how infinitely great must be the difficulties of administering such a varied and complex system. As regards the competency of the Indian judges, that is a very difficult question for us, sitting in this House, to decide. Nevertheless, it happens that we are able to test, to some extent, the competency of these judges fitly to discharge the duties of their office, by observing how their decisions are dealt with when they reach this country. A return has been presented to the House of the decisions of the Privy Council in appeals from India. The appeals come from two Courts, namely, the Supreme Court, presided over by Queen's judges, who are barristers of some standing and reputation from this country, and the Sudder Courts, presided over by the Company judges civil servants who have spent their life in India, and have ultimately been raised to this high judicial office. The appeals camprised in the return to which I refer have been decided since 1833. There have been ninety appeals from the Sudder Courts, of which sixty-three hare been affirmed, 1110 and twenty-eight reversed, being in the proportion of two-thirds to one third. The appeals from the Supreme Court have been thirty-six in number, of which ten have been affirmed, and twenty-six reversed, being in the proportion of one-third to more than two-thirds. The House will observe that in the two cases the proportions are reversed of the decisions of the Company's judges two-thirds have been affirmed, while of those of the Queen's judges only one-third has been affirmed. Looking at these results, and that the judges of the Sudder Courts are chosen from gentlemen who have sat as judges in the various country districts, I am not disposed to come to the conclusion that the Company's judges are utterly incompetent efficiently to discharge their duties. As regards the native judges, there is, I fear, some truth in the assertion that they are, to a certain extent, tainted with impure and corrupt practices, the remains of the ancient system of administering justice. It, however, is most satisfactory to find, from the evidence of Mr. Halliday, that of late years a great improvement has taken place in the practice of the native courts, and that the Judges are gradually being raised above the temptations to which they formerly yielded. Mr. Halliday says  ""The (native) Courts themselves, within my observation and knowledge, have manifestly improved in regard to integrity and trustworthiness."" This circumstance is of more importance than might, at first, be supposed, because, in consequence of the increased employment of natives in the judicial service, a large proportion of civil suits are decided, not by English, but by native judges. It appears, by the evidence of Mr. Hill, who is at the head of the Company's legal department at the India House, that only six or seven per cent of all civil suits are decided by English judges, the remainder being disposed of by native judges; and, taking original cases only, not more than one per cent is decided by English judges. I say, therefore, that this statement is satisfactory in two respects: first, as showing the great extent to which natives are employed in that branch of public business for which their service seems most available, namely, the administration of justice: and, secondly, as affording evidence that the native courts are gradually improving, and approaching to the purity as well as the ability of the English tribunals. Beyond the very general employment of natives in the  1111 administration of justice, they are now constantly employed in higher situations than formerly. They have been frequently appointed deputy magistrates, and Lord Dalhousie took the unprecedented step of appointing a native to a situation of considerable importance in Calcutta. Mr. Halliday states in his evidence:  ""Lord Dalhousie appointed a Hindoo of high caste, high family and character, stipendiary magistrate of Calcutta, much to the annoyance of the English applicants for the situation; but the natives especially exhibited their jealousy and dissatisfaction in so many ways, that the person appointed complained to his friends of the bitterness of his position, and the pain and misery which had been brought upon him by the constant attacks, public and private, and the annoying petty jealousy which he had experienced from his countrymen in consequence of his elevation.'"" It is disappointing to find such results from the appointment of a Hindoo to a higher situation than had ever before been filled, except by an European; but this is no reason for not appointing a native to such an office. I am most anxious that natives should be employed as extensively as possible in situations for which they are fitted; and that they should also be gradually appointed to higher situations than they have generally occupied hitherto; but it is obvious that there may often be difficulties which do not occur to one at first sight. It cannot be agreeable to a native to be placed in an employment in which he becomes an object, not of envy, but jealousy, to those around him, who, had they our feelings under such circumstances, would be proud of their countryman's elevation. I pass now to the question of public works. This is, certainly, a subject of the greatest importance, as regards not only the welfare of India, but the interest of this country. It has been earnestly pressed, not only on my attention, but on that of those who have preceded me at the Board of Control, by gentlemen interested in one of the largest branches of English manufacture namely, that of cotton. When these gentlemen did me the honour of waiting on me, they took what seemed to me the unnecessary trouble of apologising lest they should be supposed to have been actuated solely by selfish motives in pressing the matter on the attention of the Government. It certainly never occurred to me that they were actuated by such a motive. It is, undoubtedly, an object of the greatest importance to this country to increase the supply of cotton in every pos- 1112 sible way. It is a great evil and one to be avoided, if possible to be dependent; on one country alone for the supply of a staple article of manufacture employing many thousands, I may say millions, of our population. So far from complaining of the gentlemen to whom I have alluded for having stirred this question, I think we ought to be grateful to them for having called the attention of the Government of India and of this country to a subject of such vital importance. I have already explained that, in consequence of the large expenditure caused by the political situation of India for some years past, the Indian Government has been unable to devote as large a portion of the revenue to works of public improvement as even for the interests of the revenue itself might be advantageously applied to such purposes. On the whole, however, this subject has attracted, and is attracting, more and more consideration, year by year, and day by day. I hold in my hand some statistical details, which will be laid before the House very shortly, and which afford satisfactory evidence of the increased attention which is devoted to the question of public works. This document shows a great increase in the funds appropriated to public works during the last fifteen years. The average of the first five years of the period was 250,000l.; of the second five years, 240,000l.; and of the last five years, 400,000l. This account, though it affords a fair criterion of the increase of late years, does not, in truth, give a fair representation of the actual expenditure in these years. The total expenditure, including the cost of establishments, convict labour, and other items, not embraced in this account, amounts, for the last year, to upwards of 700,000l. Taking the account as it stands, however, as a measure of the comparative expenditure of former and recent periods, there has been an increase of about 40 per cent in the expenditure on public works in the latter years. Another great subject of complaint has been the deficiency of roads; and here I must confess at once, that in many parts of India the means of communication are deficient. On the other hand, more has been done in this way than hon. Members are, perhaps, aware of. Allow me to refer to accounts of what has been done in this respect in the various Presidencies. The great trunk road to the Upper Provinces, and the furthest extent of our terri-  1113 tory, is already open from Calcutta to Kernaul, 78 miles beyond Delhi, in all 965 miles, and in two years it will be completed to Peshawur 1,423 miles. It is a macadamised road, ""smooth as a bowling-green,"" upon which carriages go at the rate of ten miles an hour; serais and provision depots have been established at convenient distances, and there are guardhouses and police stations every two miles; the road is watched and patrolled night and day, and it is calculated that an officer of some sort is employed for every half mile. Mr. Raikes states that in his district, notwithstanding ""parties of wearied merchants are spending the night all along the road under the canopy of heaven,"" the losses by robbery were nil., and those by theft no more than 4d, per 100l. In the Presidency of Madras, the great western road to the borders of Salem and Bangalore from Madras has been put into proper repair; the traffic upon this road is larger than that of upon any other road in India, and the cost of carriage has been reduced one-third since 1846. Three different trunk roads have been made or repaired, opening Mysore and Coimbatore to the west coast. Cotton from Coimbatore now goes to Ponany, a port on that coast, instead of being carried to Madras, and the carriage of it has already been reduced from six to two rupees per bale of 3001b., making in many cases the whole difference between profit and loss in the export. In Canara, where in 1831 wheeled carriages were unknown beyond the town of Mangalore, 508 miles of good road are completed, and six excellent ghauts are now open. The exports of cotton, coffee, & C, have largely increased, and the imports of British piece goods doubled since 1838. A good road south towards Trichinopoly has been formed. On the other hand, wishing to conceal nothing, I must frankly admit that the great north road is in a very bad state; but 240 miles of canal along the line will be opened in connexion with the Godavery and Kistna works, and Colonel Cotton says, therefore, it is quite out of the question at this moment to waste any money on this part of the road. District roads are generally wanting in this Presidency, but their state varies very much in different parts of it. In Salem, Madura, Tanjore, and Cannra, they are good. In Bellary and Cuddapah, together half the size of England, and growing cotton and indigo, they are altogether wanting, there being 1114 only thirty miles for the whole. A direct line to Cuddapah has been sanctioned, and a pass on it opened; so the want, as regards a great line of communication, will soon be supplied. I do not for a moment mean to say that many public works are not required; but still I declare with truth that much has been done, much is in progress, and that as soon as funds are forthcoming, the Government will apply them to the purpose of opening and improving the communications from the interior to the coast. These are the roads which are much more important for the benefit of commerce, and improvement of the country, than the north line which runs parallel to the coast for nearly all its length, I have here an extract from the Scindian newspaper, which shows that even in this, our last acquisition, great attention is paid to the construction of roads and canals. In the interior of the country, the roads for conveying the produce are by no means so bad as some persons would have us to believe. In reference, for instance, to the great cotton-growing districts in the Bombay Presidency, Mr. Davies, the Collector of Broach, reports in 1849, that  ""There are no macadamised roads, and no materials wherewith to construct them, yet nowhere throughout the Presidency is communication so well kept up, not only on the great lines of traffic, but between village and village, and nowhere is the number of carts greater in proportion to the population."" And Mr. Bell says that in Candeish  ""There is a passable and often an excellent cart road in many districts from every village to its neighbour. The main Bombay and Agra road is in excellent order; the traffic and travelling on the cart roads is constant during the fine season; the province abounds with fine cattle, and carts for burden and for locomotion are in general use."" Such is the account of the ordinary roads in the great cotton-growing districts of the Presidency of Bombay. Great part, however, of the Indian cotton is grown in the interior of the country in native States, and for the purpose of bringing this cotton to the coast at such a cost as would render it profitable to do so, common roads are inadequate. I believe that for the transport of cotton from Berar to the coast, a railroad is necessary. It becomes doubtful, therefore, whether it is worth while to expend large sums on trunk roads. Indeed, it is probable that the great trunk road, to which I have before referred, leading from Calcutta to the upper provinces will, in a great measure, be superseded when the  1115 railroad is completed. In reference, however, to this important question the construction of railroads in India I cannot here avoid expressing my opinion that the Indian railroads, although there was, perhaps, some delay in the first instance, were commenced without sufficient consideration. The consequence has been that in the case of both the great railroads, it has been found necessary to change the line originally laid out. In the first instance it was intended that the line from Calcutta should run along the old road through a comparatively wild and uninhabited country; but after it had been carried to a certain point it was wisely determined that it should run along the line of the river, and through the most populous parts of the country. The direction of the line from Bombay was also changed after the works had been commenced. It was planned and commenced on the supposition of its being carried over the Malseg Ghat, which on survey has been found to be impracticable; and it is now proposed, instead of attempting this passage, to carry it over two other Ghats, and to pass the ridge in two places instead of one. This change of purpose has fortunately been determined on before any part of the line, of which the first portion has been opened, had been carried beyond the point where the deviation would commence; but I refer to these circumstances for the purpose of showing how important it is not to begin a line until all circumstances connected with it have been fully and maturely considered. There is no person more competent to form a correct opinion on this matter than the present Governor General of India. He made himself master of everything connected with railroads when he was President of the Board of Trade in this country; and I believe that, as regards several railway undertakings here, great advantage would have resulted from following the suggestions made in the able report to which that noble Lord's name is attached, and which was for our assistance laid on the table of the House. My right hon. Friend who preceded me in office did well, I think, in referring the whole of these questions connected with Indian railways to the consideration of the Governor General, for of all men in Europe or Asia he was the most competent to form a correct judgment on the subject. I expect a final report from the noble Lord by the next mail. Looking to the vast importance of the question, I have thought it right to defer any deci- 1116 sion on the subject until I receive Lord Dalhousie's report. On receiving it I can declare, on the part of the Court of Directors and myself, that no time shall be lost in carrying the railroads through with as much rapidity as the means at our disposal will allow of. It is indispensable that the great lines I will not speak of them as they have been hitherto called, experimental lines should be completed as soon as possible to their, proper termini, and no expense shall be spared to effect that object. Another part of the public work which is of the greatest importance, is the irrigation of those parts of India which require artificial aid to render them productive. This is one of those points on which the statements contained in the Madras petition are most signally false. The petition states that nothing has been done in the Presidency of Madras to promote irrigation, and it quotes ""the latest published Report of Captain A. Cotton upon the Tanjore district,"" as the petition calls it, to the effect, that millions of gallons of water are daily running into the sea, uselessly and wastefully down the Coleroon, which, if properly employed, might bring fertility and plenty to the district; and the authors of that petition would have the people of this country believe that such is the case at the present time. Now will the House believe that the report was made in 1837, about fifteen or sixteen years ago; that works for damming the Coleroon had even then been commenced, and were completed in 1841, twelve years ago, and by which upwards of 1,000,000 acres have been irrigated. The success of that work was so complete that another similar work was immediately commenced on the Godavery, which I believe will be finished in the course of the present year. In the last report on the public works which has been received in England, and which has, I think, been laid upon the table of the House, I find the following passage with reference to the works on the Godavery:  ""A liver exceeding two miles in actual width, besides the islands, which at that point divide it into four branches, and running over a bed of pure sand of unknown depth, was to be arrested in its course by a dam, 12 feet high, thrown across it, and a large part of its waters was to be distributed over an extent of 3,000 square miles by means of a network of channels; and all this was to be done in a country where such works had never been heard of before on a scale of magnitude, or at least only by tradition, and to be effected by  1117 the agency of workmen who had to be taught almost everything."" These works in India are constantly spoken of as if they were on the same scale as those constructed in this country, and constructed with the aid of able engineers and skilful workmen; and complaints are made that they are not executed as rapidly and as well as in England. But let Gentlemen fairly consider such an account as I have just read of the character of these works, and of the difficulties attending their execution. It is most unjust and ungenerous to condemn persons acting under such circumstances for not completing the works intrusted to them as rapidly and substantially as they can he done here. The Coleroon anicut has been finished some time; the works on the Godavery will be finished this year; the Kistna, another river in the Madras Presidency, has been surveyed, the necessary machinery has been removed there from the Godavery, and in the course of three years, when this work will probably be completed, the irrigation works in the Presidency of Madras will have extended to 3,400,000 acres of land, which will be available for the cultivation of sugar, cotton, rice, or other crops requiring irrigation. In the northern provinces the irrigation works are carried on in a different way. Instead of dams, canals are constructed. The Jumna canals, which have been constructed some time, have brought 625,660 acres into cultivation. With regard to the Ganges canals, they were sanctioned in the year 1838, but were unfortunately stopped by Lord Ellenborough on his arrival in India. Some notion was entertained that they were likely to prove prejudicial to the health of the inhabitants; an inquiry was made into this point by order of Lord Hardinge, to whom it was reported that no disadvantage whatever could accrue to the health of the district, and the works were therefore ordered to be continued. They were begun in 1848, and, according to the report of the committee of engineers they will be completed in 1856. By that time 810 miles of irrigating canals will have been constructed, and 1,560,000 acres of land will be watered by the canals in connection with the Upper Ganges. Similar works are now in course of construction on the Ravee in the Punjab, which will also be probably completed about the same time, and about half a million of acres will be watered by canals of 450 miles in length. The total number of acres which will be irrigated by 1118 the canals in the Bengal and Madras Presidencies amount to nearly 6,075,660; but even these figures do not give an adequate notion of the extent of land that will be benefited by the irrigation. As regards the districts to be watered by canals, one third part only requires the actual irrition, although the remaining two thirds derive the greatest advantage from supply of water. The above amount, therefore, is far below that actually benefited, and the total amount of acres benefited by irrigation will be between 14,000,000 and 15,000,000, or rather more than the whole cultivable area of Ireland. I see also that sanction has been given to the construction of two lines of canal from the Indus, one of them being near Shikar-poor, the other near Hyderabad. It is, no doubt, of late years that the attention of Government has boon more and more called to this subject; the officers employed in the administration of the country have seen the great advantages which these works have conferred on the people, while at the time the revenue has been increased, and they are, therefore, encouraged to press them forward to a greater extent and with great rapidity. Their exertions have been approved and seconded by the Government both in India and at home, and the best security the public can have for the prosecution of works of this kind is, that they contribute to the improvement of the revenue as well as to the benefit of the people. Measures have been taken both in India and this country for putting these works on a better system than that on which they have hitherto been conducted. Formerly, they were divided among different boards, an arrangement which created great confusion. In Bengal superintending engineers have now been appointed, who are responsible for the whole of the works in their respective districts. Only the other day a despatch was sent to India, giving instructions that the whole system of public works should be placed upon a better and more general system; that an annual estimate should be prepared for the whole of the public works in each Presidency; and that a considerable portion of the revenue should be annually expended in a systematic manner on those which are the most important. I do not know that I can expect the House to listen with much patience to the details into which I must now enter with respect to the tenure of land in India. Great complaints are made by those who think that  1119 the tenure of land in the Madras Presidency interferes with the production of an article which it is desirable to import into this country namely, American cotton. In the Madras Presidency the ryotwar system obtains, which is an arrangement made between the State and each cultivator. The land is divided into very small portions, varying from one to ten acres. The opponents of this system desire that it should be abandoned, and a description of landlords created, holding, as nearly as may be, the same position as the landlords in this country. That was a favourite system with the Court of Directors for many years the Presidency of Bengal was settled upon it in the time of Lord Cornwallis. It is called the ""Zemindary system."" The Court of Directors desired that it should be extended to the Madras Presidency, and measures were taken for the purpose of doing so. Land was divided into lots, each constituting an estate of considerable size for India, and, to all appearance, landlords of the desired description were created; but, most unfortunately, this scheme turned out a complete failure. The system which now prevails in the Madras Presidency is the consequence of the failure of the attempt to create a system of large landlords. The Zemindary system is now represented as an inestimable benefit to the whole of the population. Lord Hastings did not think so. What was his account? He speaks of the benevolent purpose of Lord Cornwallis, and says:  ""Yet this truly benevolent purpose, fashioned with great care and deliberation, has, to our painful knowledge, subjected almost the whole of the lower classes throughout these provinces to most grievous oppression; an oppression, too, so guaranteed by our pledge, that we are unable to relieve the sufferers; a right of ownership in the soil, absolutely gratuitous, having been vested in the person through whom the payment to the State was to be made, with unlimited power to wring from his coparceners an exorbitant rent for the use of any part of the land."" I quote this description to show that the Zemindary system has its dark as well as its bright side; and indeed each of the systems of local tenure has its advocates, who maintain its exclusive advantages, and condemn every other mode of tenure. It is very difficult to decide on their comparative merits. We may well hesitate before we attempt again to introduce that system into the very district where its failure has been most complete. It appears by the evidence given before the Committee of 1832 by Mr. Lewin, a gentleman very well 1120 acquainted with many parts of the south of India, that the ryotwar system was the natural and ancient tenure of land in that part of India. The person by whom it was more generally extended throughout the Presidency of Madras was one of the ablest of Indian servants, Sir Thomas Munro. There was no desire on the part of the then Government to extract large amounts of rent from the ryots there' was no imperative order for the establishment of the system; it was established by a man who had the interest of the natives very much at heart, who was better acquainted with them and with their habits and customs than most people, and who, in spite almost of the directions of the Government, established the system, believing it, in his experience, to be most certain to benefit the country. In Madras the Government stands in the relation of landlord to the cultivating ryot, and I think that the most determined advocate of tenant right in Ireland would be charmed to see a relation between landlord and tenant introduced into that country such as that which was established in India by Sir Thomas Munro. It entirely prevented the existence of a middleman; the rent to be paid by the tenant was fixed at one-third or one-fourth below the average payments of the preceding ten or twelve years; and so long as he cultivated the land, and paid his rent, the cultivator possessed an indefeasible right to his holding. Circumstances have, no doubt, changed since that period, and the amount of rent then imposed has, I think, become too high in consequence of the general fall in the price of the produce of the country, and on this ground a revision of assessment may be desirable. The principle, however, of the ryotwar system is what I have described, and what is commonly called the annual settlement is in truth only determining how much of the stipulated rent shall be remitted to the ryots in each year in consideration of adverse seasons or other causes which render them unable to pay the fixed rent. In the north-western provinces what is called the Village Settlement prevails, and seems, so far as we can judge at present, to answer there very well, and in consequence we are recommended by some persons to extend it over all India. Certain persons undertake on behalf of the whole village to pay the land revenue which is assessed upon it. Leases are granted for thirty years, which give them a more per-  1121 manent interest in the land, and they are responsible for each other's defaults. Some of the land is cultivated by themselves, some by other persons not named in the lease from Government, The system suits perfectly those districts where it is in accordance with the old habit of the country; but it is a very different question whether it is possible to extend it to other parts of India. In Bombay, which is principally settled on a system more resembling the ryotwar plan, long leases are very generally given to the cultivators, which gives each man an interest of considerable permanence in his land. It might be desirable to endeavour to substitute the village settlement for the ryotwar system; but there are very great difficulties to be overcome in any attempt to do so. When I asked Sir George Clerk whether he thought it possible to change from the ryotwar system to the village settlement, he replied that it would be almost impossible. In the ryotwar system the landlord deals directly with the tenant; in the village settlement a certain number of persons undertake the responsibilities for their neighbours; and if persons willing to do this cannot be found, or if all parties do not agree to the arrangement, it becomes an impossibility. Hon. Gentlemen will see how very difficult any operation of this kind must of necessity be. The truth is, we have in times past committed the greatest injustice and injury by attempting to force on different parts of India a system to which their habits and customs are opposed. We committed great injustice in Bengal when we introduced the permanent settlement system there. We committed great injustice by forcing the same system on part of the Madras Presidency. We committed great injustice in our first attempts to settle the north-west provinces; and at last we have come, by dint of long experience, to this conclusion, that we must in each case endeavour to adapt our system to the local customs and habits of the natives. Everybody acquainted with India knows how exceedingly difficult it is to induce the people to depart from the habits and customs of their forefathers. Sir George Clerk, who knows the north-west provinces, who has been Governor of Bombay, and who had ample opportunities of inquiring into it, has expressed a favourable opinion on the village system; but there are many persons who entertain serious doubts respecting its advantages. All these matters, however, we must leave 1122 to the Administration of India to the decision of those best able to judge of the wants and feelings of the people, and to ascertain what measures under the circumstances are most likely to promote their welfare. Our object must be to frame our settlements, not on what seems theoretically to be the best, but in such a manner as is most suited to the wishes and habits of the people in their various districts. Connected with the tenure of land there is a subject to which I wish to refer very shortly I mean the cultivation of cotton, which is universally acknowledged to be of great importance both to England and to India. Some time ago, as many hon. Gentlemen well know, all the cotton of India was of a coarse description and short staple. It was well enough suited for the Indian and Chinese manufacturers; but it was wholly unsuited to compete with the American cotton in the manufactures of this country. For some years the East India Company have taken pains to introduce the growth of American cotton, and to ascertain whether the climate of India is favourable to its cultivation. I think that happily that point has been abundantly established. For some time they established cotton farms, which, as might have been expected under Government management, turned out exceedingly unprofitable. They then undertook to purchase at a certain price all the American cotton grown by the ryots; and it is now clear that the ryots understand the cultivation of the American plant very well. On this point Dr. Wight, the late superintendent in the Madras Presidency, says  ""Within the last two years many of the ryots of Coimbatore seem to have become so well convinced of the much greater advantages of cultivating the exotic than their indigenous cotton plant, that (unless I am greatly misinformed) they planted last season from 1,500 to 2,000 acres of ground with it, and seem as if they intended to treble the quantity in this year."" It is thus proved that the ryotwar system is no inseparable obstacle, as has been alleged, to the successful growth of cotton. But in addition to this native cultivation, three or four Englishmen have gone out to India to establish cotton plantations. I speak again on the authority of Dr. Wight, who states that  ""On the coast, within the last three years, Messrs. David and Arthur Lees, Messrs, T. and L. Shaw, both from Manchester, and Mr. Kenrick, of Madras, have embarked in the undertaking. The aggregate extent of land under cultivation by these persons amounts, I think, to  1123 about 2,500 acres, exclusive of smaller patches held by others, whom they have induced to follow their example."" Some time back the East India Company having, as I said, ceased to cultivate their cotton farms, they bought up the cotton produced by the ryots, at fixed prices, if not bought up by other persons. But the fact that American cotton can be grown in Madras having been satisfactorily established, I think the interference of Government ought to cease. It is their duty to provide roads and to facilitate the communication between the plantations and the port of embarkation; but the encouragement of the growth of the article ought to be left to private enterprise. I have no doubt that private individuals will be found either to take land or to make arrangements with the ryots for the delivery of the cotton grown at a certain price. The whole question is dependent on the fact whether there will be a certain market for it in this country. If there is a certainty of a market, the cultivation will be carried on. No doubt, the price to be given for this cotton from India depends on the price of the American cotton; but it ought to pay to export cotton to England, if it pays to export it to China. The exportation has increased considerably of late years, and I have no doubt, if steps are taken by the parties who are principally interested in the matter, that good American cotton may be grown to a very considerable extent. On this subject I will read a portion of a letter from a native of India which bears on the question. Speaking in reference to the growth of cotton, and the necessary interference of English capital, this gentleman (Manockjee Cursetjee) says  ""If they are in earnest, nothing that I can see impedes their acting independently of Government; and, if they would but form themselves into an association, subscribe a sufficient capital among its members, and judiciously lay it out in farming or purchasing from the Company's Government or its allies the Nizam and other districts capable of being improved by such outlay, they would not only render England independent of America in respect to their cotton supplies (which appears to be their grand object), and obtain an accession to their imports of other East Indian produce, but they themselves would reap a large profit independently of the consideration of improving the moral and political condition of the people of the place. On the other hand, it can hardly be expected that the natives of India, if left to themselves, would bestir themselves in any such national undertakings, then ideas and prejudices being generally against any innovation."" 1124 That is the opinion of a very enlightened native of India, well acquainted with the feelings and prejudices of his own countrymen; and he thinks all that is wanted is that the plant should be cultivated by British capital, that the required capital should be sent out to India, as was done in the case of indigo. [Mr. BRIGHT: Where was that letter written? Was it written in England or India?] It was written in India. [Mr. BRIGHT: What is the date of it?] I am not sure as to the date. I find on looking at the paper that I have no date marked on it. Well, Sir, next comes the subject of the revenue of India. I will trouble the House but very shortly on that subject. The revenue of India is raised almost entirely by what is called a land tax, which is in the strict sense of the word not a tax at all, but is a portion of the rent of the land. All preceding Governments of India have invariably taken different portions of the rent of the land as constituting the main source of revenue, and the English Government have followed their example, and about three-fifths of the whole revenue of India is raised from this source; so that, according to the description of the able historian of India, Mr. James Mill, ""the wants of the State are nearly altogether supplied really and truly without taxation."" It leaves every person at liberty to cultivate his land as he pleases, and does not affect his industry in any way whatever. And again, to use Mr. Mill's words, ""The wants of the Government are mainly supplied without any drain upon any man's labour, or the produce of any man's capital."" In Bengal the amount to be paid from the land is a fixed charge, and the revenue is certain; in Madras the assessment varies, as I have stated; in the northwestern provinces the rule has been laid down, which had been found most beneficial, that two-thirds of the net proceeds, after providing for the expense of cultivation, should be paid to the State, and that one-third should go to the tenant. The next main item of revenue is that derived from opium. In Bengal the Government pays a fixed price to the cultivator for the poppy juice, and manufactures the opium. There are then public sales of opium, and the revenue is derived from the difference between the sums realised at those sales, and the price paid for the poppy juice added to the cost of manufacture. The opium grown in the native States of India must of necessity pass through our territo-  1125 ries to the ports of embarkation, and our revenue is levied on the passes granted for the opium so brought down. The revenue has increased to a very considerable amount from this source of late years, and it is, according to our last returns, nearly 3,500,000l. sterling. I have had stated to me various objections to revenue from opium, some from the moral consideration of selling a drug of this kind to another nation; but I hope to receive, in this instance, some approbation from hon. Gentlemen opposite, because we have, according to their principle, succeeded in raising the main portion of this tax from foreigners. There are objections, as I have said, urged against this tax, some of them on moral grounds; but it was inquired into by the Committee of 1832, and their report stated  ""Although the Government monopoly must, in all probability, like all other monopolies, be disadvantageous, yet it does not appear to be productive of very extensive or aggravated injury; and, unless it should be found practicable to substitute an increased assessment on poppy lands, it does not appear that the present high amount of revenue could be obtained in a less objectionable manner."" The next large item of revenue is one to which, no doubt, considerable objections may also be said to exist, and that is the duty on salt. [""Hear, hear!""] Let hon. Gentlemen who cry ""Hear"" remember what has been the doctrine urged on us by great political economists of the liberal school for some years that, whatever revenue must be raised, from some source or other beyond direct taxes on property, should be raised on as few articles as possible that some few arricles should be selected, and the whole amount of our taxation should be put on them, and that all other articles should be left free. That view has been almost completely carried out in India, and every article of consumption is relieved from tax except salt. The customs duties are of very trifling amount, and all other articles of consumption are totally and absolutely free; and though I quite admit that it would be desirable, if possible, to reduce the duty on salt, and when we have a revenue to enable us to make the reduction, no doubt we ought to do so, yet, after all, the tax is not so very heavy as has been supposed. I see by the table before me that the average consumption of salt per head in India is about 121bs. a year, and the duty being 3/4d. a pound, the actual amount of duty paid by each person in India amounts to not more than 9d. a head per year. Now, consider- 1126 ing the absolute freedom from all duty of any sort or kind on other articles, I cannot say this is a tax of so very oppressive a nature as it has been said to be. It is hardly worth while going into the other items of revenue, the whole revenue of India being about 26,000,000l, a year. [An Hon. MEMBER: Not so much.] By the last accounts of the revenue, and according to the printed papers to which I have referred, we have for the last year to which the accounts come a revenue of 25,890,000l. a year, I have now, Sir, referred to those subjects which have been the general topics of the charges against the Administration of India during the last twenty years. I think I have shown that, with respect to public works, considerable misapprehension has prevailed if it is supposed that nothing has been done. I think I have shown that, with respect to the system of land settlement, which is supposed to be most prejudicial to persons holding land in India, any attempt to alter that system of tenure might, if done hastily or rashly, as we have sometimes acted in this manner, be productive of as much insecurity and injustice as has been caused by hasty though well meant proceedings in former times. If we look to that which has been done by us in the course of the last twenty years, I think there is much on which we may congratulate ourselves. I find that in the last twenty years, partly by law in our own dominions, partly by influences exercised by us on other States, in the greater part of India slavery has been, in fact, put an end to. In the year 1829 Suttee was abolished by law in our own portion of the country; in 1840 it was abolished by the Guicowar, and by the chiefs of other adjoining States; in 1846 it was abolished in Jypore by the influence of Colonel Ludlow; and eleven out of eighteen of the Rajpoot States followed the example. In 1847 Lord Hardinge announced that, ""Suttee, infanticide, and slavery are prohibited throughout the territory forming the remotest Hindoo principality of India (Cashmere)."" There was hardly any crime so prevalent among the Rajpoot States as Infanticide; in fact, it was not considered by them as any crime at all; and it is most interesting to witness the influence of a single officer in putting an end to this system of murder. This has been effected by the exertions of one man, Mr. Unwin, in a  1127 State where it prevailed to a frightful extent. In Myupoorie, in 1843, there was not a single female infant left alive; in 1850, 1,400 female infants were born during the year, and were alive at the end of it. Mr. Willoughby has used similar exertions, and with very great success, in Kattywar. When we remember that on this subject the prejudices of the Rajpoots were exceedingly strong, that they conceived it almost a degradation to have female children, we must take it as a strong proof of the influence of a single officer that he should have been enabled to put down a crime of this nature, so prevalent, and so rooted in the habits of the natives. I know there are many persons who have a fancy of looking back to some golden age of Hindostan, before the English foreigner set foot on the soil, when a system of law and order, of tranquillity, justice, and peace prevailed, such as has not been witnessed since; and yet I confess that the more I inquire, the further this age of gold seems to retire from our sight; and when I refer to history and to documents the most ancient I can get, I never yet have been able to discover a period when this universal peace and prosperity prevailed. In no period to which authentic history reaches can we find anything like the peace and comfort which prevail under our rule in India, and I will not go back to the fabulous days when an Indian Apollo piped to his attendant shepherds. It is within the last twenty years that the monstrous system of Thuggee was discovered and put down a system by which murder was carried on under the sanction of religion. Could anything be more monstrous than this, that a large class of people, believing they were performing acceptable sacrifices to the Deity, should roam from one end of the country to the other, and commit wholesale murders for no object whatever, but the mere commission of the murder? On this question of the state of India in former times, I have found the assertions in some quarters, of the mischief of our rule, so strong that I have found it necessary to look back to records of those former times to see what the facts really were. I have referred not to any English historian, because he might be partial, but to a foreigner, long resident in this country no doubt, as Minister from Sweden, but still to one whose character is well known to those interested in Indian affairs. Count Bjornstjerna, quoting from the History of Hindostan, of Golaum Hoosein Khan, says  1128 ""At this time (the beginning of the 18th century) all prisoners of war were murdered all suspected persons were put to the torture; the punishments were impaling, scourging, &c. The people in certain provinces were hunted with dogs like wild beasts, and shot for sport. The property of such as possessed anything was confiscated, and themselves strangled. No one was allowed to invite another to his house without a written permission from the vizier or rajah of the place where he lived, and the people were constantly exposed to the most dreadful plunderings and outrages. Such [continues Count Bjornstjerna] was the situation of Hindostan during the latter part of the dominion of the Great Moguls. It became still worse when Nadir Shah, like a torrent of fire, overwhelmed the country, and was perhaps most unhappy when, after the departure of Nadir, India was left in the power of the Mahrattas, whose only object was plunder and devastation. Hindostan then presented a picture of such unheard of oppression that one shudders at the description. Thousands of examples may be found in the history of these times, of the whole population of conquered towns being massacred by the conquerors: Delhi, which then had more than 1,000,000 of inhabitants, became quite desolate after Nadir Shah's massacre, which continued seven days without intermission. Shah Abdala, Nadir's successor on the Persian throne, also loft it to the pillage of his outrageous soldiery (1761), and it fell a third time a sacrifice (1767), to the power of the Mabrattas, who massacred all who could not save themselves by flight."" That is a picture of the period of the administration of the Great Mogul, and that is the period which is always quoted as the time in which Hindostan was so extremely peaceful and prosperous a state from which it has fallen into degradation under our withering rule! We are told that justice is so badly administered under our rule, that here again the contrast with former times is very much against us. [""Hear!""] Now, I will read the hon. Member who seems to think so an article on this subject from a native paper published at Delhi:  ""Let us give a specimen of what the English really do for this country. In former times, under our vaunted ancient kings, there were many places in this very city (Delhi) where a poor man could not venture after sunset without the chance of having his turban stolen off his head; and now a weak old man may pass in safety over that same, ground with a bag containing 1,000 rupees in his hand. The roads through the wilderness were so' unsafe in former days, that no one dared to travel without an armed guard, and robberies in the jungle were of constant occurrence. Now the loneliest traveller knows no fear. We often hear the praises of this king, or that wuzeer, who perhaps built a paltry serai, or laid a dawk to Cabul to provide himself with musk melons; but who does not know that our Government, by the construction of good roads, has placed the luxuries of distant places within the reach of the poorest people; then as to the administration of the laws, under the native rulers of old justice was put up  1129 for sale, and this is now unblushingly done in the independent native States; while, under the British rule, rich and poor, black and white, Christian, Hindoo, and Mussulman, all alike obtain equal justice. The kings and rajahs of old defied all religions as they sat on the judgment seat; whereas the British study the religious scruples of every suitor, consulting the Mooftees when Mussulmans are concerned, and the Pundits in the case of Hindoos, and they do their best to discourage litigation by promoting the adjudication of cases in Punchayet."" I refer those who speak of the deterioration of the country under our rule to the opinion of a native writer on the subject. The hon. Member who cheers, may know better than any native; but he will forgive me if I prefer the testimony of a native editor to the information he may have on the matter. Well, Sir, we examined Sir George Clerk, who is well acquainted with the north-western portions of India, on this subject, and he stated:  ""On the decline of the Mahomedan Empire, every village found it necessary to repair the defences which had existed, or to erect new ones if they had none before. All Upper India was covered with bands of horsemen, Sikhs, dashing at everything, and the inhabitants only repelled them by erecting little citadels in the middle of the villages, with watchmen aloft on a high lookout. The bricks which formed these redoubts are now all taken for the houses of the cultivators. There are no such defences now to be seen in the British territories. The districts are highly cultivated. There is not a vestige of the jungles near villages."" I will refer now to the statement that, even at the present time, the condition of our territories is worse than that of those under the rule of their own princes; and I will read the statements in some recent Indian papers with respect to the condition of affairs and of existing society in native States. Let us take the State of Oude. In the Calcutta Englishman we read  ""The continual warfare which distracts Oude for eight months in the year, is now carried on upon a more extensive scale than ever."" Is that a condition of things more favourable to the cultivation of the soil and the prosperity of the inhabitants of the country than exists in British India? Again, as to the Nizam's territories, it is stated in the Madras Spectator:  ""The state of violence and rapine is such that capitalists do not quit their houses till they have provided escorts from their military friends."" That this is not an inaccurate representation of the state of things in the Nizam's territories is certainly confirmed by what I heard from the late Resident there, whom 1130 I saw the other day, and who had the best opportunities for knowing the real state of the case. Now, be it remembered, that it was into this very territory of Hyderabad we were told by one witness that the people of our districts fled for refuge and when they got there this is what they had to expect. The conclusion of that evidence, however, was not a little remarkable, because we were told by the witness that these people fled to escape the technicality of English law, and it appeared that this was owing to the use of stamped paper, for they thought it would be perjury if any false statement were made on stamped, while it was not so on unstamped paper. I have often heard Rampoor, one of the native States quoted as being much better governed than any part of our own dominions; but it is curious enough that the present Nawab of Rampoor had been a deputy collector in one of our provinces, and has improved the administration of his country in consequence of the knowledge of the methods of doing so, which he had acquired when he was employed in the service of the Company. I have no reason to think that the works which have been executed by native princes are at all superior, or, in fact, can at all compete, with those works bridges, canals, and roads which are executed by our Government. No one is better acquainted with the ancient history of India than Sir H. Elliott. No one is better acquainted with the administration of the north-western provinces of India than Sir H. Elliott is. Here is what he says:  ""To the North-western provinces, at least, cannot be applied the taunt that we have done nothing compared with the Mahomedan emperors with respect to roads, bridges, and canals. Even here, in the very seat of their supremacy, we have hundreds of good district roads, where one never existed before, besides the 400 miles of trunk road, which is better than any mail road of similar extent in Europe, and to which the emperors never had anything in the remotest degree to be compared. In canals we have been fifty times more effective. Instead of wasting our supply of water on the frivolities of fountains, we have fertilised whole provinces which had been barren from time immemorial. The scientific survey alone of the North-western provinces is sufficient to proclaim our superiority, in which every field throughout an area of 52,000 square miles is mapped, and every man's possession recorded. It altogether eclipses the boasted measurement of Akbar, and is as magnificent a monument of civilisation as any country in the world can produce."" Why, Sir, really when I read these things I am at a loss to account for the  1131 assertion so recklessly made even by some who, from their acquaintance with the country, I should have thought had been in possession of better information on the subject, that we are disgracefully neglecting our duty in regard to India. Not many years ago there was a system of most odious transit duties through India; there was a custom house at intervals of every eight miles, at which goods were stopped and subjected to a heavy customs duty. Those duties have been entirely abolished. [An Hon. MEMBER: How long since?] They were abolished at various periods in different Presidencies. In Madras, which is the last place in which they were given up, they were abolished in 1844, and the Customs revenue was reduced, in consequence, from 36 lacs of rupees to 18 lacs a loss of one-half. I must say that I see no evidence from which it can be supposed that the condition of the people of India is not as good as that of the people in most other parts of the civilised world. If hon. Gentlemen will turn to a book of not very recent date Bishop Heber's Journal they will find there accounts of the state of the Presidencies, showing a degree of comfort among the people, which, taking into consideration their condition and the requirements of their climate, may be looked upon as superior to what we should find in many parts of Europe. I will not trouble hon. Gentlemen by quoting from that work, with which they are probably familiar, but I will refer to a more recent publication, because it states the condition of the peasantry in that portion of India where it is asserted that the ryotwar system is productive of the most injurious effects. This is a quotation from the work of Mr. Dykes, late assistant-collector at Salem, respecting the condition of the people in that district of the Presidency of Madras. Mr. Dykes says  ""Agricultural labour can readily be obtained for 1s. 3d. a week, the articles of daily consumption being cheap in the extreme. The Government demand for an acro of dry land (2s. 8d.), scarcely exceeds what a common labourer can earn in a fortnight, about which amount of labour will also find him with an ample supply of salt for the whole year. The signs of improvement cannot be mistaken. When the people throw down the walls of their villages and towns; when the cottage shines out among the distant fields; when the children drive the cattle to pasture, and troops of women pass fearlessly along the public roads, seeking the neighbouring markets these, surely, are different times from those that saw the ryot go to the plough with his spear or his matchlock 1132 in his hand; when the trade of the country, carried on bullocks, straggled from village to village, guarded ever by armed men, and the merchants feared to engage in cultivation, because then gains could not be hid with sufficient case; the greatly increased fertility of the soil, the increasing traffic, the improved bazaars, the value that land, even under the present system, is everywhere acquiring, all show clearly that capital is accumulating, and that the condition of the people is better than it was."" These statements, of course, refer only to particular districts, though I have no reason to suppose they are not fair specimens of what exists throughout most parts of our Indian territory. But we have still more convincing proofs, not only of the increased power of production, but of the increased power of consumption of the people of India, in the returns of their imports and exports. I see, for instance, that the average importation of their sugar and molasses into this country in the ten years ending 1842 was about 444,000 cwt., while the average importation in the last ten years has been 1,369,000 cwt. The average importation of rum has risen during the same period from 233,000 gallons to 600,000 gallons, and has thus been more than doubled. The importation of coffee has risen from 2,358,000 lbs. to 3,256,000 lbs. The importation of cotton wool has increased from 58,000,000 lbs. to 80,000,000 lbs. So much for their powers of production. Now for their powers of consumption. The value of the cotton piece-goods imported into Calcutta in 1833-34 and this will be some comfort to the manufacturers of this country was 700,000l., while in 1851 it was about 2,950,000l. Surely that shows a power of consumption which proves most completely that the condition of the people must be improved of late years. Well, Sir, I will take now the whole exports and the whole imports of India, and the case is still more remarkable. The value of the whole imports of merchandise in 1834-35, was 4,261,000l., while in 1849-50 it was 10,300,000l., being an increase of no less than 140 per cent. The exports in the same time have increased from 7,993,000l. to 17,312,000l., being an increase of 112 per cent. With all our boasted increase of trade at home, the value of our exports in the same time has increased, not 112, but only 66 per cent, while the improvement in production in India, as measured by the exports, has thus increased in nearly double the ratio of that which indicates the increase of production in this country. Can anybody believe, after these figures, that  1133 the condition of the people of India has deteriorated in the course of this period; and must it not be apparent, on the contrary, that alike in their powers of production, and in their means of purchasing the quantities of goods which have actually been imported into India, ample proof is thus afforded of the vast improvement in the condition of the people. There are many minor topics which I should be anxious to mention, as affording evidence of the desire on the part of the Government of India to advance the interests of that country. I will only refer, however, to the trigonometrical survey, which is a work of vast importance, not only for scientific purposes, but for the more practical object of facilitating the surveying and laying down the boundaries of villages, and indeed of every man's property and occupation, and of preventing the constant litigation as to the rights of the various owners and cultivators of land. We are establishing lines of electric telegraph for 3,150 miles, connecting all the great towns of the Indian peninsula; and I must say it affords me the greatest satisfaction to read the constant accounts of the attention which is paid to the improvement of the people in various ways, by the establishment of dispensaries, the extension of vaccination, the formation of schools, and various matters of that kind, which in other countries are left to the charity of individuals, but which in India have been taken up by the Government, and which prove, I think, that in every part of that vast empire unremitting attention is paid to the improvement of the condition of the people. I have before stated that many things may have been left undone, many things ought to have been done more completely; but I must say, that I think great credit generally is due to the administrative officers in India for the energy and zeal which they have displayed in their various functions; to the Government of India for supporting them in their administration; and to the Government at home, who have invariably urged upon the Indian Government measures for the welfare of the country who have sanctioned almost every expense asked for such purposes and who have encouraged by their approval the exertions of the various officers. I will only allude to the opinion of one of the ablest of modern historians who has written an account of the administration of India in late years I mean the author of the History of the War in Afghanistan, 1134 Mr. Kaye who concludes his work with a review of what has been done in India, in which he says that much has been omitted; much more might have been done than has been done, if means had been available; but that, as it was  ""more good has been accomplished in India, more earnest, serious, and enlightened legislation has taken place for the benefit of the people under the Act of 1833, than during the previous two centuries and a quarter of British connexion with the East."" I am afraid I have wearied the House by these details. I have felt, nevertheless, that I should fail in doing justice to the authorities of India, and to the administration of that country during the last twenty years, that we should not have been enabled fairly to judge of the manner in which the Government has been conducted; that we should have been liable to be misled by those representations which have been industriously circulated, and which seem to have met in some quarters with a belief to which I think they were not fairly entitled, if I had not endeavoured to put before the House what I believe to be a true and faithful picture of the state of India and the government of India during the last twenty years. Now, Sir, I fully admit that it does not therefore follow, because all these improvements have taken place, that the Government of India either ever was, or is the best that can be devised, but I say this that if we are to test the Government by the results of that administration on the condition of India, there is no ground whereupon to condemn it as being negligent and inefficient. I fully admit that if we are to test the present form of the Indian Governments by any known principles upon which government should be framed, it would be difficult to find so great an anomaly as that form of government, except the still greater anomaly of our whole Indian Empire. I admit that it is almost incredible, that it is fabulous, that such an empire as our Indian Empire should exist that a country of some 2,000 miles in length, and some 1,500 in breadth, containing 150,000,000 of inhabitants, should be ruled by a mere handful of foreigners, professing a different religion, speaking a different language, and accustomed to different habits that this mighty empire should be administered by less than 800 civil servants the number of those servants, be it remembered, not having in-  1135 creased with the increase of our dominion, but having, on the contrary, diminished it seems incredible that a private nobleman or gentleman should be sent there from this country who for five or six years, as Governor General, exercises a power greater than almost any sovereign in the world that he again should be controlled and governed by twenty-four gentlemen, elected by a body of men not perhaps the best qualified to judge of the merits of a statesman; and that this body of men should be in their turn controlled by an Indian Minister, who, in the necessary play of parties, is often put into that position without any previous knowledge of the Government of the country over the destinies of which he is called on to preside. No man, if he were to sit down to the task of constructing a Government for India, would dream of constructing a Government upon such a system for so mighty an empire. But it must be remembered that this form of government has grown up along with the growth of our Indian empire. Defects there may be in that Government, imperfect it may be; but surely, whatever its faults in theory, it cannot have been so badly administered, when under it that empire has so grown in extent and in prosperity, and the condition of the people has been so much improved. That it has been made more fit by alterations at various periods for the advancement of the interest of the people, every one knows. That it is not now what it was twenty years ago, and was not then what it was twenty years before, is known to us all; and, the period having arrived when it is necessary for us to deal with the Government of India, and to provide for it after the 30th of April next, it becomes essential to consider in what shape it should be once again remodelled and framed, in order to insure that which it is our bounden duty to look to in the first place, the welfare of the people of India, and in the second place, and dependent upon that, the interests of this country, which two considerations, however, I firmly believe to be inseparable. Now, Sir, the Government of India must necessarily be considered under two different branches' the Government at home, and the Government in India. I will proceed, in the first place, to deal with the Government at home. Faults of various descriptions have been found with the Government at home. It has been said, in the first place, that there is 1136 no responsibility. In the next place, we were told, in the earlier stages of the discussion, that the Court of Directors was an obstruction to all good government. Latterly a different line of argument has been taken, and we have been told that the Court of Directors is a fiction which ought to be done away with as utterly useless. Great complaints have been made also as to the mode of electing the Directors, and fault has been found with the existence of patronage in their hands, and the mode in which it has been administered. A further fault has been found with the mode of transacting business, as being slow, and leading to unnecessary and mischievous delay. I believe I have stated fairly the principal heads of accusation against the Home Government of India. Now, the House will observe that two of these heads are quite contradictory of each other. It is impossible that the Court of Directors can at the same time be a perfect obstruction to good government, and yet so complete a fiction as to be dispensed with without being missed. We must deal with it as either one or the other, and the arguments on the one side completely upset those on the other. I think that, as usual in all cases of this kind, the truth is to be met with in neither of the two extremes, and that it lies, in this case, as it often does, between the two contradictory propositions. Most of the misrepresentations which have taken place on this subject seem to me to have arisen from considering the Government not as it is practically carried on, but as it might be carried on under the full exercise of those extreme rights that belong to the different members of which the Government of India consists. It would be just as absurd to say that the government of this country could not be carried on because the three branches of the Legislature, if each exercised the rights to which it was entitled, would constantly come into collision with one another, or that business in this House must practically be put a stop to from the power which, by the exercise of his extreme privileges, any individual Member possesses of obstructing public business. What we have to deal with is the practical mode in which the business of the various departments is carried on; and upon this subject I must be permitted to say, with reference to the course which has been taken in the Committees appointed by this and the other House of Parliament, that it is useless to examine persons coming from India, and  1137 persons who, not having had any experience in the mode of conducting business here, really can tell us very little on the subject. Those who have been in one office or the other the Board of Control, or the India House and who know how the business of the several departments is conducted, are far better able to give information upon the subject than those who, from want of experience, cannot by possibility know anything of the matter. The home business of the Government of India may be divided into two distinct parts. One comprises the political relations of the Government of India with other States, and questions of peace and war. These questions are decided not by the Court of Directors, but by the Government of this country, and their orders are sent through the Secret Committee of the India House, and for these decisions, not the Court of Directors, but the Government of this country, is entirely and altogether responsible. Upon that point, therefore, there can be no question as to divided responsibility or anything of the kind. The Secret Committee merely acts as an organ to convey to India the directions sent from the Board of Control; and the President of the Board of Control is, in that respect, only the organ of the general Government. A good deal of unnecessary importance appears to me to have been attached to a declaration made by Lord Broughton, that he alone was responsible for giving an order to the Indian Government as to crossing the Indus by the army for the Affghan war. But that order must have been signed not by Lord Broughton alone, but by two Cabinet Ministers; and he was no more responsible for the order than the Secretary of State at the time for the order directing the Duke of Wellington to cross the Pyrenees. The act is not the act of the President of the Board of Control alone; it must be in pursuance of the determination of the Government. There is no mistake, no concealment, about the matter, and it is nonsense to talk of the irresponsible power of the President of the Board of Control, because the Government of this country is as responsible for war in India as it is responsible for war in Europe, Africa, or America. The other great branch of the Government is what is Called the ordinary business of the administration of India, and in that the Directors take a very considerable and important part. Every despatch is addressed to them, all questions are considered by them in the 1138 first instance, and they have the initiative on every question. Grants of money cannot originate in any way with the Board of Control, and in the exercise of patronage, except in some of the higher appointments, the Directors are entirely uncontrolled. In the greater portion of their business, however, they are liable to the check and supervision of the Board of Control. A draft of every despatch is sent up to the President of the Board of Control, is considered and revised by him, is sent back to them; is submitted to a committee at the India House and then to the Court, and is there carefully revised; and it is only just to the Directors that I should say, as far as my experience goes, I have reason to know that the most careful attention has been given by them to every important despatch. It isquite true that the President of the Board of Control has the power of overruling, in the last resort, the Court of Directors. I therefore fully admit that I am responsible to this House for any acts in the administration of India, just as the Secretary of State for the Colonies is responsible for the acts of administration connected with his department. In substance, there is no difference between the two cases, though there may be a difference in form. Hon. Gentlemen seem to treat this question in a very singular manner, for at one time we are told it is impossible to say that the Court of Directors can be responsible, and at another time it is impossible to say they are not responsible; and again that they cannot find out who are responsible for the government of India. The simple state of the case is, that the President of the Board of Control is the person responsible to Parliament for the government of India. But all this is nothing new. It has been stated over and over again to be the case for the last seventy years, and it has been perfectly well known to every one who has thought it worth his while to inquire into the subject. The same fact has been stated, in better language than I can pretend to use, by Lord Grenville, who, in 1813 used this remarkable language:  ""The law which passed in 1734, the source of all these benefits, the very line of demarcation from which commences the good government of India, did actually commit this whole authority (the political direction of India) to Commissioners appointed by the Crown. In the Public Board, so constituted by the wise and necessary interposition of Parliament, and continued with slight variations by succeeding Acts, has ever since resided a complete and effective superintendence  1139 over every part of the political affairs of India. That Government has still been exercised, indeed, in the name of the Company, as the Company also has used the name of the Asiatic Powers whose misrule it has superseded; but both the control and the responsibility of all political measures are vested by law in the public servants of the State. The commerce and the patronage of the Company are alone excepted, but on all other matters which in any way concern the public interests in India it is the office and the duty of the King's Commissioners, at their discretion, to exorcise a complete and unqualified political control. It is their function to erase, to add, to alter, and, in the default of the Directors, to originate those instructions which by law the public servants in India are bound implicitly to obey."" These words seem to me to describe the state of things, as it existed in 1813, precisely as it exists at present. The President of the Board of Control has succeeded to the authority here represented to reside in the Commissioners. I am now responsible to Parliament for the affairs of India. Every person, however, who is acquainted with the course of public business, must know that, although the head of every department is answerable and responsible for the whole business of that department, yet that in great matters he would consult his Colleagues in the Ministry; that in other matters his decision, as chief of his own department, would be sufficient; and that in minor matters, having confidence in the persons in his department and under his authority, he, upon their representation, issues the orders that may be necessary. But there is a difference between the orders so issued by the Secretary of State, and those which may proceed from the Board of Control. Before any despatches are sanctioned by the Board of Control, they must have been carefully sifted and investigated by a body of independent gentlemen, many of them intimately acquainted with the people of India, and most zealous and unremitting in the transaction of business; and so far there is greater security for the good government of India than of our Colonial possessions. It must be obvious, also, to every one that the mere power of originating despatches, must of itself give no inconsiderable share of influence to that body. It is clear that if I did not issue despatches except upon matters raised, and communications made to me by any hon. Member of this House, he could not but exercise a very considerable influence in the decision, whatever that decision might ultimately be. Mr. Mill than whom there could not be a more competent witness said, before the Committee of the House of Lords  1140 ""I do not think the present system is fairly described as a fiction, since it is acknowledged, that not only the Board of Control, but the Cabinet, when of a different opinion, sometimes think it right to defer to the opinion of the Court of Directors, no doubt because they feel that the Directors are more competent to form an opinion than themselves."" On these two points, then, I will only say, that there can be no question: first, as to where the responsibility to this House lies; and next, that the functions of the Court of Directors are not that absolute fiction which they are represented by some to be, but, adopting again the words of Mr. Mill, ""that they have a full share in the administration."" The last imputation against the Home Government of India that I shall notice is, that in consequence of the numerous written communications which take place, and the divided residence of the two authorities the Court of Directors and the Board of Control Indian business is slowly transacted. I admit that the tendency of the mode of transacting business is to render it slow; but as to a large portion of Indian business, despatch is not of the slightest importance. The principles upon which the government of India is and ought to be conducted are laid down here; but the government of India is and ought to be administered in India. Good men ought to be carefully selected to carry out the views of the Executive. But then, when a proper selection of the instruments of government has been made, the more that is done in India the bettor; and the object of the examination here is to see that in the exercise of the power of the Governments of India in detail, those principles so laid down in this country have been observed. Orders for executive administration are seldom issued from hence. The greater part of the business consists in revising the acts of the Indian authorities; but that is not business which requires much despatch. Perhaps I should not be far wrong in saying that nine-tenths of the Indian business is to revise and to see whether the administration of India is carried on consistently with the principles laid down. There are cases, no doubt, and sometimes very difficult ones, when most important matters arise which require a more rapid transaction of business. In cases of that kind, immediate and frequent communications take place between the Board of Control and what are called the ""Chairs"" of the East India Company. I am happy to take this opportunity of stating, that my hon. Friend the late  1141 Chairman, and the present Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the East India Company, have always been most ready and willing to meet me, and have afforded me every facility and assistance that I could possibly require. Whenever it was important to obtain an early decision, they would ask to see me, or come to me at once when I sent for them. A personal communication takes place without delay, and a despatch is sent out immediately. About a month ago I thought it desirable that the interest on the 5 per cent loan should be reduced. The Finance Department reported a probable surplus of 500,000l. after paying for the Burmese war. I thought this an opportunity not to be lost of diminishing the expenditure by making a reduction in the rate of interest. I spoke to the Chairs; they agreed with me; and in compliance with my wishes, a despatch was prepared and submitted to me, and by the next mail the order went out to reduce the interest of the loan. In another case, when the electric telegraph was determined upon, all the arrangements were made in less than one month after the receipt of the despatch of the Governor General, recommending that this step should be taken. With a mail to India once a fortnight, and with personal communications such as I have described, there is no time lost in anything that requires speed; and on this head of delay in transacting business there has been the greatest misrepresentation and misunderstanding. But one great defect in the constitution of the Court of Directors has been pointed out namely, that, owing to the necessity of a protracted and expensive canvass, the best members of the Indian service are deterred from offering themselves as candidates for the situation of Directors of the East India Company. It is said that it is a bad mode of remunerating the services of the Board of Directors that they should look only to the distribution of patronage for their reward. I do not think that the imputations which have been made on this latter point are borne out. It has been said that the Indian army and service do not receive a fair proportion of the patronage. The evidence clearly showed that the sons of Indian servants and officers have received a very large and sufficient share of appointments. I think the Directors have taken great pains to preserve their patronage from being improperly applied; but I admit that there exists a general opinion that it is undesirable that 1142 the remuneration of the Board of Directors should consist in their patronage. I have now stated the principal objections that have been made to the present mode of conducting the Indian Government, and how far, in my opinion, those complaints are justified. But I still have to consider what it is desirable the Government of India should be for the future. The hon. Member for Manchester said the other day, at a meeting at Bristol on the subject of India, that nothing could be satisfactory except a single Government by means of a Secretary of State. That also is the view of the gentlemen who have associated themselves together for the reform of the Indian Government. Now, we must consider what would be the effect of a change of this description. The proprietors of India Stock and the Court of Directors will remain a body until 1874, and they will be entitled to receive the dividends upon their stock which are secured upon the territory of India, or to claim to be paid the amount of that stock. They claim to revive as a commercial body, and to carry on their trade with the capital thus reimbursed. The Government, on the other hand, would assume the charge and government of India, and the obligations, liabilities, and debts, of the East India Company; and I am not sure whether my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer would be pleased to have the debt added to his present obligations, because, although it is true that it is secured on the Indian territory, yet it might be convenient that the same thing should be done for India which we have done for some of our Colonies, and that by giving the guarantee of the Government, a lower rate of interest should be payable on the debt. This has, I see, been already suggested by a noble Lord in another place; and, though in the present state of things I should not think of preferring such a request to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the case would be very different if India was administered as our other dependencies by the Government of this country, and in the name of the Crown. I do not believe that this is an insuperable objection, but it is one that requires to be carefully considered before we make any change. With regard, however, to this vital question of the nature of the future Government of India, we ought to look to the evidence that has been given before our Committees on this subject. The question whether we ought to have a single or a double Govern-  1143 ment for India has been mooted before both the Committee of the House of Lords, and the Committee of the House of Commons. There are three witnesses whose evidence has been said to be more or less in favour of the single Government. The evidence of the last witness examined upon this subject (Mr. Sullivan) is not yet in the hands of the Members of this House; but it can hardly be said to be in favour of a single Government, because Mr. Sullivan leaves two bodies one for patronage, and the other for the management of Indian affairs. However, as his evidence is not in the hands of Members, I will not enlarge upon it. The most important evidence on this subject is that of a noble Lord (the Earl of Ellenborough) who has been himself President of the Board of Control, and Governor General of India; and I am bound to bear my testimony not only to his great acquaintance with Indian affairs, but to the singular ability with which he expresses his views on these subjects. I do not know that I shall be charged with having said more than I am justified in saying, if I add that one cannot be surprised to find the noble Lord approaching any consideration which affects the Court of Directors with some little bias. The noble Lord recommends that the Government of India should be as follows: That there should be a council of twelve, who should be originally named in the Act of Parliament; that one-sixth should go out every year, and that they should be replaced by persons who have filled high situations in India, and who should be nominated on the recommendation of the Governor General, and of the Governors of the Presidencies of India. The noble Lord proposes that the whole patronage should be vested in the Council, and that they should have a veto on the appointment of a Governor General; but, naturally enough, the noble Earl did not propose to give them the power of recalling him. He suggested that these Councillors should be quite independent of the Government, and irremovable for six years. I remember the time when the patronage of India was supposed to create a power in the State of no inconsiderable amount; and a body like that which the noble Earl suggests, and the members of which would be practically irremovable for six years, would constitute an exceedingly independent and powerful body. Therefore, although the noble Lord's professed object is to get rid of the double Government, he does not do so in fact, and 1144 only proposes to transfer to the Council the power of the Directors, and to make them, as indeed he says himself in another answer, ""the advisers of the Board of Control, precisely as the Board of Directors now are."" But the noble Lord goes further, and says that his only object is to provide for the President of the Board of Control an able body of advisers. The noble Lord states that he should not object to the continuance of the present system of choosing the Court of Directors if he were sure that it would be filled with men like the late Mr. Charles Grant, Mr. Elphinstone, and Sir Richard Jenkins. The sole object, then, of the noble Lord appears to be to obtain good advisers from Indian servants for the Board of Control, and therefore in whatever manner this may be effected, his object would be accomplished; but when he leaves this second body as powerful and independent as he proposes it should be, and acting in regard to the Board of Control much as the Directors now do, this, after all, seems to me to be only a double Government under another name. The noble Earl says, that when he wanted advice about Nagpoor, he went not to the Court of Directors, but to Sir Richard Jenkins, one of the Directors, who had been Resident at Nagpoor, and that, fortified by his opinion, he was perfectly indifferent to the opinion of the Court. I quite concur in the propriety of the course adopted by the noble Lord of consulting the person who was the best able to give him advice and information upon the subject then under his consideration. I should have thought it right, however, even if I had consulted Sir Richard Jenkins, to consult the Directors also, and I should not have thought myself justified in treating the Court of Directors quite so cavalierly as the noble Earl said that he was prepared to do. The next gentleman examined, whose opinion is said to be in favour of the single Government, and who, as regards all matters in India, gave most valuable evidence, was Mr. Halliday, late Secretary to the Government of India at Calcutta; but when Mr. Halliday was examined on the English part of the question, he stated that he was not so well acquainted with the Government in this country that he could give his opinion without very great diffidence. Well, but what was Mr. Halliday's opinion, which was said to be a decided opinion in favour of a single Government? His view was in favour of the appointment of a body of twenty-four gen-  1145 tlemen, elected as at present, or perhaps as vacancies occurred, allowing a portion to be nominated say one-third or one-fourth as the case might be by the Directors themselves. This body would form a Council for India, perfectly independent of the Government, exercising the patronage as at present, and discussing all important matters connected with India with the President of the Board of Control, that he might have the advantage of hearing their discussions and weighing their arguments. I believe that most matters are carried on in India under the single responsibility either of the Governors or of other officers who manage the affairs of their districts, without consulting any person; and perhaps one ought not to be surprised at such an opinion from a man who has had little experience in Committees or Councils of many persons. But gentlemen who are conversant with the deliberations of Committees in the House of Commons, and those who are acquainted with the proceedings of Cabinet Councils, can imagine what would be the result of a Council of such numbers meeting to discuss with the President of the Board of Control, or in his presence, all important Indian questions, or, as Mr. Halliday says, for the complete carrying out of his scheme all Indian questions. Now I must observe that Mr. Halliday proposes to give to the President of the Board of Control the absolute power of deciding as he pleases, whether he agrees with his Council or not. Does anybody practically acquainted with such matters suppose for a moment that such a system could be worked? Does anybody suppose that the business of a heavy department could be carried on with an executive Council of twenty-four members? Even if the President and his Council generally agreed, their numbers would be a practical hindrance to all business, from the variety of opinion, at any rate upon numerous matters of detail, which must necessarily exist amongst so many gentlemen. But suppose that the President in three or four cases overruled his Council, and that an irritated and sore feeling was thus excited, how would the business be carried on? If the President of the Board of Control was bound to attend their deliberations, the time would probably be wasted in endless bickerings and disputes, quite enough to interrupt the progress of all business; and if he was at liberty to absent himself, he would of course relieve himself from so unpleasant a position as this would inevitably 1146 be, by deciding all questions, as he would have a right to do, without reference to his Council, and they would become utterly useless. But in any case to talk of this as a single Government, is an abuse of words. And Mr. Halliday, when he was asked whether he was favourable to a single Government for India, on a question put to him, at his own request, by the Chairman of the Committee, that he might remove any misapprehension as to his meaning, said that he only aimed at improving what he understood to be the present mode of transacting business, without introducing organic changes, which in his opinion were not desirable. He said that he would ""reform existing institutions only as far as they needed reform, and would keep them otherwise in all their integrity; that the system of double Government and election by the Court of Proprietors had undoubtedly, whatever defects may be attributed to it, the good effect of keeping out mere party differences and discussions from the Government of India, and that good he would on no account do away with."" But Mr. Halliday, beyond his own opinion, and I have quoted his own words, gives very strong and very important evidence on this subject of single Government. He sees clearly enough that none of these proposals do in fact amount to single Government. He sees clearly enough, and I agree with him, what a single Government ought to be, if we are to have it at all, and he says, with this view  ""The plain straightforward course would be decidedly to have the Government and the Council nominated altogether by the Crown; but whenever I have spoken of that with well-informed persons, I have been informed, in a manner that I could not possibly resist with my want of experience, that such a measure was totally out of the question; that it was quite impossible; and therefore, driven from that, I fall back upon what appears to me to be the more practicable suggestion, which I have made in the course of my evidence to-day."" The witness states distinctly what he thinks would really establish a single Government, and he says he has been told by' every well informed person with whom he has spoken on the subject, that such a measure is totally out of the question. Surely after this statement of his evidence, he can hardly be represented as a witness who has practically advocated the establishment of a system of single Government. Now, these are the witnesses whose evidence is supposed to be in favour of a-  1147 single mode of government. I am aware that we have in this House advocates of that form of government, and I have no doubt that we shall hear from the hon. Member for Manchester and others able and powerful arguments in favour of such a scheme; but, certainly, they cannot claim in support of their views the evidence of those gentlemen to whom I have just referred. But we have, on the other hand, the very remarkable evidence of a person well known to this House, and well known to the world, as one of the ablest writers of the day on subjects connected with questions of government, of taxation, and of political economy. I do not myself agree with him in some of his views on the latter subjects, but I have always borne willing testimony to his ability 1 mean Mr. John Mill. No doubt it may be objected to Mr. Mill, that he is open to the suspicion of having a bias in favour of the East India Company, in whose service he is. But, on the other hand, from his intimate acquaintance with the mode of transacting business in connexion with the affairs of India, which is greater, perhaps, than that of almost any man in this House or the country, he has better means than most men of forming an opinion, and his evidence, therefore, is of the greatest weight; and I will say from what I know of him, and from the high character which he holds in the country, that I do not believe Mr. Mill is one who would express an opinion which he docs not honestly entertain. I think, therefore, that the opinion and it is not an opinion that is not accompanied by the reasons on which it is grounded which he has given in his evidence, is entitled to no inconsiderable authority. Though, therefore, his answers are rather longer than I should wish to read, yet they are so well put by him, and are so much to the purpose, that I should be sorry to diminish the effect of them by not giving his own words. Let me, before quoting this evidence, observe that it is obvious, if the Government is to be vested in a Secretary of State, that such Secretary of State must be responsible to Parliament, and to Parliament alone that, in short, it is only to Parliament that the whole Government of India must be responsible for the good administration of the affairs of that country. On this subject Mr. Mill says  ""No one will deny that it is necessary that Parliament should be open to appeals on all subjects connected with the government of any part of the British Empire; but, so far as my opinion 1148 goes, I should say that the security for the good government of India derived from discussions in Parliament is far short of that derived from the habitual examination of all papers of any importance by persons especially devoted to that object."" He is then asked what would in his opinion be the result of more frequent Parliamentary interference, and he answers  ""I think that many bad and few good consequences would result. The public opinion of one country is scarcely any security for the good government of another. The people of one country, whether represented by the public authorities of this country, or by the nation itself, cannot have the same acquaintance with the circumstances and interests of the other country as they may have with their own. The great security for the good government of any country is an enlightened public opinion; but an unenlightened public opinion is no security for good government. The people of England are unacquainted, or very ill acquainted, with the people and the circumstances of India, and feel so little interest in them, that I apprehend the influence of public opinion in this country on the government of India is of very little value, because there are very few cases in which public opinion is called into exercise, and when it is so, it is usually from impulses derived from the interests of Europeans connected with India, rather than from the interests of the people of India itself."" He was asked with regard to the effect of this kind of government generally, and he says  ""There would be two great inconveniences. In ordinary cases there would be apathy and indifference on the part of Parliament and the public; the Secretary of State for India would be able to do exactly as he liked, and to omit any part of his duty if he were too indolent or too ignorant to perform it; but whenever it did happen that interest was excited in Indian questions, they would become party questions; and India would be made a subject for discussions of which the real object would be to effect a change in the administration of the government of England."" The objection, therefore, which Mr. Mill takes to the Government of a single Secretary of State is first, that it would introduce party considerations into the administration of India; and, secondly, that in the present state of information with regard to India, the experience of persons whose lives have been devoted to Indian subjects is a better security for good government than the sole check to be exercised by the House of Commons, reserving, of course, to the House of Commons that necessary interference on important matters which upon all questions it undoubtedly ought to exercise. Now, it is a remarkable circumstance in connexion with this question, that since the celebrated Bill which decided the fate of Mr. Pox's Administration, party politics have seldom or ever entered into the consideration of In-  1149 dian affairs. Party questions with reference to India are almost totally unknown either in the other House of Parliament or here; and I do not hesitate to say that it would be a source of imminent danger to India if its affairs were again made the objects of party warfare. I have been in Parliament long enough to see that in colonial matters questions have occurred in which the interests of a colony have been neglected in the contests of party politics of this House. But we must not shut our eyes to the circumstance that the case of India is in no respect similar to that of the colonies. In all the colonies belonging to this country there is a large portion of British subjects well acquainted with the principles of representative government; and even if the worst were to occur if, which God forbid! any of our colonies were to be separated from the mother country though I do not sec why the connexion, founded on mutual benefit, should not last for a period much longer than we can any of us loot forward to but even if a separation were to take place, there is hardly one of our colonies which would not be able with more or less success to govern itself. But if a revolution of that kind was to take place in India, will any one say that consequences must not ensue at which humanity would shudder? There is, in truth, no similarity between the probable consequences in the one case and in the other, and therefore it is of the utmost importance not to allow party politics to interfere with the government of that great dependency. There are very few Gentlemen in this House who have been in India, and I believe that even residence in one part of India is by no means sufficient to enable a person to form a competent opinion with regard to other parts of India. I have heard an hon. Friend who sits behind me, and who knows India better than most men, state that what he has learned was not learned from a residence of many years at Calcutta, but has been learned almost entirely from constant and unremitting attention to his duties as a Director at the India House. I believe that those who have been long connected with the India House have a better knowledge of Indian affairs than any of us possess, and therefore I think there is much truth in the opinion of Mr. Mill, that it is a great security for good government that all the details of the Indian administration should be subjected to the careful revision and careful exami- 1150 nation of people who have devoted their lives to the study of Indian matters, and that they should be looked over by those who have spent a portion of their time in India, who, collectively, have a greater knowledge of the subject than we possess in the House of Commons, and whose opinion, therefore, should have the greatest weight. In reference to the very principle on which the double Government is founded, Mr. Mills says  ""That all Indian proceedings are reviewed by two separate bodies independent of one another, is a much greater security for good government than would exist under a system by which those two bodies were merged into one. The double revision by persons of a different class, in a different position, and probably with different prepossessions, tends greatly to promote a close and rigid examination."" Again  ""If you have a body unconnected with the general government of the country, and containing many persons who have made that department of public affairs the business of their lives, as is the case with the Court of Directors, there is much better discussion and much better sifting of the matters committed to their charge by having such a body in addition to the Minister of the Crown, than by having the Minister of the Crown without such a body, or the Minister of the Crown acting as chairman of the body."" And he concludes his evidence upon this question by a distinct opinion that any change from a system like the present ""would necessarily be a change for the worse."" I will now refer to the opinion of a noble Lord who himself was a Cabinet Minister in this country, and subsequently Governor General of India I mean Lord Hardinge and I may say that no one is better able to give a sound opinion than Lord Hardinge. He was a Cabinet Minister at the time of the differences between the Government of this country and the Court of Directors, when Lord Ellenborough was recalled; as Governor General, he became well acquainted with the administration of affairs in India, and he now stands in a position perfectly independent, both of the Government and of the Directors, and is able therefore to express an unbiassed and impartial opinion. His opinion was expressed as follows:  ""I think the system of double government is much wiser than bringing the Crown more prominently forward. I think the present plan is the best. For two members elected by the Court of Proprietors, one Director might be put in by the Court itself taken from the Indian service, who had been a member of Council, or who had gained a high reputation for his service in India. I do not think it would be advantageous to have the  1151 Court of Directors filled with men who had served in India; there ought to be in the Court such a fusion of European feelings and talent, as well as Indian feelings and talent, as would not make it too Indian. A body of persons solely impressed with Indian views would not administer the government of India so well as the present Court of Directors."" But these opinions are not confined to persons only who are resident in England. I will quote the opinion of another of our witnesses on this subject, and that is the opinion of Mr. Marshman, a gentleman long resident in India, to whom I have before referred, unconnected with the Government, perfectly independent, well acquainted with the feelings of the people of India, and he says  ""I think that a change, such as the transfer of the whole of the Government of India from the Court of Directors to the Crown, would be much too violent and sudden, and would tend very much to embarrass so vast a machine as that of the Government of India; and I think it would be more advisable to prepare for the change which must take place by gradually remodelling the Government. It might be possible to prepare for the great change by the nomination of a certain proportion of the Directors, so that the public would have an opportunity of seeing immediately how the newly-modelled machine worked. One-fourth or even one-third of the Directors might be appointed by direct nomination from among those who have had long Indian experience."" I will only refer, in one word, to the evidence of Sir Charles Trevelyan, himself an old Indian servant, and well acquainted with the affairs of that country, as well as with the machinery of Government at home. He states most decidedly that, in his opinion, ""an improved Court of Directors, together with a Board of Control, is the best form of government for India."" I have now stated all the evidence that has been given on this subject, and I must say not only that the preponderance of evidence is in favour of maintaining and improving the present form of government, but that there is no evidence which, carefully examined and tested, supports the views of those who advocate the government of India by a Secretary of State. It is obvious that one of the objections stated by Mr. Mill namely, the want of information in this country on Indian subjects, is one that, with increased communication between this country and India, may be expected to diminish from day to day. Mr. Marshman expresses his surprise at the interest which on his arrival he found the affairs of India have excited 1152 in this country; and I may be allowed to express the hope that it is a subject which will excite a still larger and more constant share of the attention of this House and of the country. If, too, by the improvement and education of the natives of India, we can establish a race and a class of men such as Mr. Mill describes as affording the best security for good government, then a great point will be gained for the government of India; but clearly that time is not come as yet. The opinion of such men will have great weight in India, and will be of great service in aiding the formation of sound public opinion in this country on Indian affairs. The time which is passing over our heads, the more ready communication with India, which is increasing so rapidly from day to day, will diffuse a knowledge of the affairs of India much more generally among the Members of this House, and render them more and more able to discuss with advantage the affairs of that country. I am most anxious to forward this object, before the attainment of which the too frequent interference of the House might lead to evil rather than good. I find that notice has been given of a Motion by an hon. Friend of mine to-night upon a subject on which it was my intention to have made an announcement to the House on the part of the Government, namely, that the President of the Board of Control will make an annual statement on the finances of India to the House. This used in former years to be the practice; but it has been discontinued for a long time, for no other reason, I believe, than because no attention whatever was paid to the subject, and when the Minister rose from his seat to give his account of Indian affairs, the other Members of the House walked out of it. The question then for the Government to decide is, whether it shall continue the government of India as it is whether it shall assume the government of India to itself or whether it shall maintain the present form of government, but improve its constitution. I think with the defects that have been stated in the constitution of the Court of Directors, it is impossible to leave the government of India as it is. If, on the other hand, the Government had been anxious to grasp at power; if I had wished to place myself in a position the most powerful, I think, that any Minister could hold, possessing the undivided sway over our Indian empire a prize well  1153 worthy of any man's ambition and had obtained to this course the consent of my Colleagues, we might, I have no doubt, have persuaded the House to make that change in the form of government for India. But we do not think it would be for the advantage of India that this course should be adopted. We think it far wiser and safer to maintain the present form of government, and to improve its constitution in such a manner, that while it will be rendered a more fitting instrument for the good administration of Indian affairs, the change which we propose, will in some respects render it more easy to do, at a future time, what circumstances or an extension of the information on the subject of India, may render fitting, namely, to assume the government of India in the name and the immediate power of the Crown. I will not, on the present occasion, occupy the time of the House by any further arguments in support of this course. I will only say that I agree generally in the views which have been so well expressed by Mr. John Mill, and that they are supported by the authority of those whose knowledge and situation enables them to exercise a sound and independent judgment on the question. What we propose to do is leaving the relations of the Board of Control and Board of Directors as they stand leaving the responsibilities of this House, and of the Minister who holds the situation which I now have the honour to fill as they now are to improve the constitution of the Court of Directors, limiting their patronage, and imposing some check on the higher appointments made by them in India. The Court of Directors consists of thirty members, but twenty-four only sit at one time, whilst six are always out by rotation; and though the Directors are subject to an election every four years, they are practically elected for life. We propose to reduce the elective members to twelve, and to add to them six to be appointed by the Crown from persons who have served ten years in India. Six of the elected Directors must also have served in India for the like period. That will make a Court of Directors consisting of eighteen persons. It was suggested that the Court themselves should select one-third of the number; but it appeared to us that the Directors so chosen by a majority of the persons amongst whom they are to sit, would be placed in a position depen- 1154 dent upon those by whom they were appointed, and we thought it better that they should be nominated on the responsibility of the Crown, and named from persons who had been at least ten years in the service of the Crown, or the East India Company in India. The appointment in this manner will obviate the objection that the best of the Indian servants do not obtain a seat in the Court of Directors. It has been shown beyond doubt that many of those most competent to take a part in the Government of India coming home from, thence, and fully able in this country to take an active and useful part in the administration of its affairs are deterred by the canvass from trying to obtain a seat in the Court of Directors; and we believe we shall improve the efficiency of the Court by placing in it, without the necessity of going through a canvass, persons of that description. The Government can have no object but that of placing the most efficient men in this situation; and in consequence of their selection being confined to Indian servants, any nomination for party purposes, or from party considerations, is, as far as possible, guarded against. We propose that one-third of this number should vacate their seats every second year, but be eligible, or be capable of being nominated again without the interval of a year. Great inconvenience is now experienced by the intervening year, when Directors are out by rotation, and if they are fit to be in the Court at all, there is no reason why that interval should exist in their service. With regard to the elected members, we do not propose to make any change in the nature of the constituency by whom they are elected. We do not propose, as was suggested by some, to add the holders of the securities of the East India debt, because in that case people residing in India must be included, who, if they vote at all, can only do so by proxy. Neither shall we add, as has also been suggested, all those who have served in India, because the retired officers of the Indian army are so numerous in comparison with all other persons retired from the Company's service, that, as stated in Mr. Campbell's book, if we adopted this course we should throw the whole election into the hands of the Indian officers, and should not, therefore, give that fair share of influence to other parties to which they are entitled. I do not think, from all I can gather upon the subject, that any great advantage could be derived from increasing the number of the persons  1155 entitled to vote in the election of Directors, and I propose, therefore, to make no alteration in that respect. We do not contemplate to effect the whole of this change at once. We propose in the first instance that is, on the expiration of the Charter in April next, that the present thirty Directors should select fifteen of their number, and that the Crown should select three persons who have served ten years in India. These will make the eighteen, who will be the first Directors of the East India Company under the new arrangement. Then the first three vacancies that occur in the elected Directors will be filled up by the nomination of the Crown until the full number of six members so named is completed. That once done, all future vacancies in the elected Directors will be filled by election, and all future vacancies in the nominated members will be supplied by nomination, so as to maintain permanently twelve elected and six nominated members. We propose that every Director should serve for a period of six years; one-third of the Court, both of those elected and those nominated, going out every second year, but being capable of re-election or re-nomination, as the case may be. All the persons to be nominated by the Crown, and six of the elected Directors, must have served either the Company or the Crown ten years in India."	317.0	1853.0	1850	[('good', 'good', ['positive',

313910	313910	S3V0183P0-00123		ADJOURNED DEBATE. EIGHTH NIGHT.	THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER		"THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER: At last, Sir, we have obtained a clear declaration from an authoritative source; and we now know that a Bill which in a country with five millions of adult males [""Oh, oh!"" ""Hear, hear!""and cries of ""Order!""] Am I to be permitted to proceed? [""Hear, hear!""and renewed cries of ""Order!""] and we now know that a Bill which in a country with five millions of adult males proposes to add to its present limited constituency 200,000 of the middle class, and 200,000 of the working class is, in the judgment of the leader of the Tory party, a Bill to re-construct the Constitution on American principles. Sir, I rise after one o'clock in the morning to review, as well as I am able with the aid of this declaration, a debate which has continued through eight nights. And first, Sir, I would gladly have passed by the defence, as he calls it, and as I must presume he thinks it, which the right hon. Gentleman has made for himself and for his friends with reference to the history of the past twenty or thirty years. I have no desire to interfere in that controversy. I will not attempt to follow him through its details; it will require from me only the briefest notice as to its general scope. I have too much respect for the time of the House to weary it, at this hour, with matters which it is in my power to avoid; and I must say that I have too much 114 respect for the judgment of the House, and for the judgment of those elsewhere who will become acquainted with our proceedings, to have the slightest apprehension that any one of the mistakes, or any one of the misrepresentations consequent on the mistakes, which have proceeded from the right hon. Gentleman, will have an influence on the House or on the people. Now, Sir, I am afraid that I must begin by owning that I have much to say. I will endeavour, however, to consult the convenience of the House by clearing out of the way at the outset some misapprehensions which the right hon. Gentleman has assisted to propagate, and which have prevailed on the other side during this debate; to these I will refer exceptionally, because I think they have considerably obscured the general issue. In the first place, I must presume to say a word upon the subject of the references which have been made to a great name among us in this House and in the country I mean the name of Lord Palmerston. It has been assumed by Gentlemen who are supporters of the Amendment that they honour the memory of Lord Palmerston by describing him either generally as the enemy of Reforms, or specially as the enemy of Parliamentary Reform. Or again, and yet more specifically, by describing him especially as the enemy of that which constitutes the essential point and the very hinge of the whole framework of this Bill; namely, a reduction of the borough franchise. Now, Sir, to throw light upon this subject, I will read but a few words which Lord Palmerston used in supporting his own Bill in 1860. He said, that the provisions of that Bill were open, as without doubt the provisions of our Bill, and of every other Bill are open, to consideration in Committee; but he went on to use these words, ""there are certain fundamental principles in the Bill which we could not consent to have infringed, because that would destroy the measure altogether."" One main principle of the Bill is, the reduction of the borough franchise. It has been assumed by some speakers, that the life of Lord Palmerston was a security against the introduction of a measure of Reform. I think it no less due to Lord Palmerston than to his colleagues to say that, as far as I am aware and I presume the right hon. Gentleman will admit that if mischief of any kind had been brewing in the Cabinet I probably should have known it there never was a difference of  115 opinion between Lord Palmerston and his colleagues on the question of Reform. In my own judgment, we underwent a great responsibility in regard to the measure of 1860. The introduction of that measure was an important step in redemption of a very solemn pledge; of a pledge which might almost have been termed the basis of our official existence at the time. The abandonment of that measure probably must have taken place at some period of the Session in the stale of affairs in which we stood; yet it was a matter difficult to determine as to the precise time and circumstances. I admit that in that abandonment we underwent a great responsibility. Differences of opinion there might have been with regard to it; but I know of no Member of the Cabinet of Lord Palmerston who ever thought that, after the abandonment of that measure, and considering the circumstances which prevailed from the year 1860, down to the dissolution of last year, it would have been wise or warrantable for the Cabinet to have revived the subject of Reform. The right hon. Gentleman quotes, and grossly, I must say, misquotes, a speech of mine on the subject of the suffrage: no, Sir, I will not say he misquotes it, for he did not refer to my actual words, but I will only say he misstates the effect. The right hon. Gentleman, however, if he recollected that speech at all, might have recollected that in that speech I declared that in my opinion it would be wrong for the Government to introduce or take up the question of Parliamentary Reform, till there should have arrived such a state of public opinion as might seem to afford a prospect of success. That, I believe, was all along the unanimous opinion of the Cabinet. It has been observed, indeed, that my right hon. Friend the Secretary for the Home Department declared last year that we did not make our appeal to the country as the patrons of a great measure of Reform. Certainly not; we tendered no such profession. We left the country to pronounce its own impartial judgment; and we waited, in the state of things I have referred to, for spontaneous indications of the public mind with regard to the representation of the people in Parliament. But my right hon. Friend himself has stated that when the elections had taken place he individually formed the opinion, which, as far as I know, was the opinion formed by the other Members of the Cabinet, that the manifestations which had been given by the coun- 116 try, and by candidates when appealing to the constituencies, in respect to Parliamentary Reform, had brought again before us the very occasion on which it was our duty to become responsible for another measure of Reform. Nor have we the smallest right, the smallest ground, to suppose that Lord Palmerston differed from that opinion. We cannot, indeed, say that he agreed in it; and why? Because, at the moment of his lamented death, no single Cabinet had been held for the purpose of considering the measures to be adopted during the coming Session. But I do chance to know, and it is a posthumous record of some interest, that Lord Palmerston had a conversation with one, at least, of his colleagues at no very long period before his death it may have been a twelvemonth, or even more; I cannot further define the time on this very subject. I have not the smallest doubt in my mind, though I cannot state it as a matter of fact, that he was looking forward to the dissolution as the critical period when a fresh decision would have to be taken. In that consideration he stated his opinion that within a limited time it would be right for the Government again to introduce the subject of Reform. So much, Sir, for the honour of Lord Palmerston, which I confess I think has not been in the most judicious hands during the chief part of this debate. That opinion, I hope, may be expressed without offence, and without trangressing in letter or in spirit the rules of Parliament. Now, I come to another subject again of a personal character, and one with which the House has been made perhaps sufficiently familiar during our long discussion. I refer to my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham. It has been made a charge against the Government that they are identified with my hon. Friend. It is admitted that we are the nominal Ministers of the Crown, but it is confidently or boldly declared that he is its irresponsible, yet its real adviser. To such a charge, couched in such terms, I shall make no reply whatever. Such persons as are disposed to admit it must have minds in a position entirely inaccessible, I will not say to deliberative reason or justice, but, at any rate, to any observations I can offer. In truth, such things are said not to convince, nor to persuade, but if not to bewilder, at least to sting. But more specific charges have been made, and these it is right that, as Her Ma-  117 jesty's servants, we should notice. It has been stated that my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham has been the adviser of this Bill. On that subject, inasmuch as it raises an issue of facts, and is therefore one which admits of being dealt with, let us consider what has really taken place. And I may preface my statement with this remark, that in my opinion, as well as in the opinion so gracefully, as well as manfully expressed by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Exeter (Mr. Coleridge), it would have been no disgrace to the Government, if policy had appeared to recommend it, that they should have consulted the great organs of opinion in the different sections of their party with respect to the best method of framing a plan of Parliamentary Reform. Had that method been pursued, it would have been impossible to overlook it would have been culpable if, through cowardice, they had refrained from consulting my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham. But Her Majesty's Government felt no such necessity; and, as far as I am aware, did not in any manner or degree pursue that course of consultation. They did feel that, responsible as they had been for the formation and the introduction of previous Reform Bills, and being, most of them, not wholly inexperienced in conducting the affairs of a Government, they had sufficient confidence in themselves, sufficient knowledge of the state of the public mind, and sufficient sense of their own responsibility to form their own opinion on the leading provisions fit to be embodied in a measure of Reform. We were, indeed, aware of the opinions of the hon. Member for Birmingham just as much, I believe, as, and no more, than the Gentlemen opposite were aware of them. And I apprehend that we were aware of them through the same unfailing channels namely, the public journals of the country. What we understood to be his opinions he stated in some speech delivered by him, I rather think at Rochdale, during the autumn, we conceived them to be as I will now state them, and my hon. Friend himself will, I doubt not, hare the kindness to correct me if I am wrong. There were, I think, four points principally put forward. Firstly, that there was a certain franchise which must be considered to be the maximum for counties, and that this was PS10; secondly, that there was also a certain franchise which must be considered to be the maximum for boroughs, and that to make this satisfactory it should on no ac- 118 count be above PS6; thirdly, he considered that the extension of the franchise ought to be separated from the re-distribution of seats; and fourthly he will forgive me if I do not quote him with sufficient precision he thought that separation of the two subjects ought to take place in order that the interval of time between the two might mature and ripen the public mind after the passing of the Franchise Bill, so as to obtain, if a later, yet a more full and conclusive settlement of the question. These, as far as my memory servo me, were the four points of opinion delivered by my hon. Friend. And what have we done? We agreed with my hon. Friend in one of them we agreed with him in the policy of the separating the franchise from the re-distribution of seats. And should we not have been the most contemptible of all the poltroons ever misnamed Ministers, if, having that opinion, we had shrunk from acting on it because we might know well enough, without any gift of divination, that the leader, forsooth, of the Tory party would found on that circumstance a charge of subserviency which he himself knows to be thoroughly unfounded just as well as we do? If subserviency exists, why has it not appeared in our conduct with reference to the other opinions of my hon. Friend? Why were we to differ with him in everything? Why have we not proposed the PS10 franchise recommended by my hon. Friend, and by the right hon. Gentleman himself in the Bill of 1859? Why have we not proposed the PS6 franchise introduced in 1860 under the express sanction of the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Calne, and declared by my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham to be the highest figure that could be allowed to stand in any satisfactory Reform Bill? If this subserviency exists, how is it that these opinions have not been followed? It is true that my hon. Friend, with, I think, great moderation and great wisdom, accepts the Bill as it stands, and his acceptance of it is converted into a charge against the Bill itself. Strange position, indeed, if we have arrived at a state of things in which the very fact that my hon. Friend gives his support to this Bill a Bill proposing a far less popular franchise than was recommended by Lord Palmerston, whose political calmness and deliberative temper have been so justly commended in this debate; by Sir George Lewis, and by the right hon. Gentle-man the Member for Calne the very fact  119 that the hon. Gentleman supports this Bill is to taint and, as it were, to poison the measure itself. Is it credible that there are such extremes of party and personal animosity in this House, and that the very essence of facts and objects is to change its nature from its relations to particular individuals? And are these the encouragements to political moderation which my hon. Friend is to receive? Such, Sir, is the state of the facts, so far as we are concerned, with regard to my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham. Yet I must still say one more word about him. I am sorry to have to do that, but I can not help doing it. I do sincerely think he is a great deal more obliged to hon. Gentlemen opposite than he is to us. It is my firm opinion though it may be erroneous that the Gentlemen who adopt the line of argument which has been adopted by the right hon. Gentleman opposite, with regard to what he terms Americanizing the institutions of the country, are doing their utmost, against their will and against their knowledge for much of what they have been doing for a long period of time has been not only against their will, but likewise against their knowledge to magnify and increase the influence of my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham; and if my hon. Friend be the dangerous man he is supposed to be, and if he nurses in his breast such wicked schemes against the institutions of the country, it is not through Her Majesty's Government, nor through the agency of those who are now thinking and voting with them, that he will ever obtain the means of giving effect to his wicked intentions, but through the line of argument and statement which has been adopted by his and our opponents, and which invests him with powers and attributes which not even his abilities, aided as they are by his known integrity, have ever enabled him to obtain. And now, Sir, I must bestow two minutes on a question touching several expressions of my own. Perhaps my best apology for troubling the House on such a matter will be that they are expressions which have furnished material in the mouths of others for some hours of this debate. The noble Lord the Member for King's Lynn, in his very clear, very forcible, very argumentative, and I must say, as it seemed to me though it has been criticized to a contrary effect by no means uncandid speech, complimented me on not having used any of those expressions which 120 may perhaps be best and most briefly summed up in a single phrase that will be sufficiently understood by the House namely, the ""flesh and blood"" arguments. Now, Sir, I wish that the noble Lord, the right hon. Baronet, and the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Calne had a little more considered what really took place with regard to the use of that and of other more or less kindred expressions. The right hon. Member for Calne for I think half an hour, the right hon. Baronet the Member for Hertfordshire for perhaps half an hour more, not having themselves heard me use the phrase which became for them so copious a theme, founded detailed declamation, argument, denunciation, and I know not what, upon an assumption. They assumed, and doubtless they believed I had used the fact, that the working classes are of our own flesh and blood as a reason why the Bill now before the House should be passed. And my right hon. Friend the Member for Calne, in a part of his speech which I admit was quite unanswerable, showed that thus to make use of such a consideration would be the greatest imaginable absurdity. Undoubtedly! But then it so happens I never did use any argument of the kind. There are limits to human folly; and neither here nor elsewhere should I have dreamed of so eccentric a proceeding. I used the expression as a reply nay, I will presume to go one step further and say, if it be not presumptuous to say it I used it as a reproof to the language of some of the opponents of the Bill. Sir, in my opinion there are times in debate when extraordinary errors are best met by the declaration of I elementary truths. When I heard it stated by a Gentleman of ability that to touch the question of enfranchising any portion of the working class was domestic revolution, I thought it time to remind him that the performance of the duties of citizenship does give some presumption of the capacity for civil rights, and that the burden of proof, that exclusion from such rights is warrantable or wise or (as it may be) necessary, lies upon those who exclude. That: as I think very simple declaration was magnified into revolutionary doctrine, and great service has it once more done to-night to the leader of the Tory party. On the same grounds, when I heard my right hon. Friend describing these working men at from PS7 to PS10, not once only it must now be said, as an invading army, and as something more, as an invading ambush, as  121 a band of enemies, which was to bring ruin and conflagration as the purpose of its mission, into a city all fore-doomed; and when I heard these opinions and this illustration once and again repeated, I thought it was time to fall back upon elementary truths as the proper antagonists to these extraordinary errors, and to say, these men whom you are denouncing, not by argument and reason, but beyond the bounds of all argument and reason, are your own flesh and blood. And now, Sir, having stated thus much, I must so far notice the speech of the noble Lord (Viscount Cranbourne) who commenced this debate to-night as emphatically to deny that in any one point or particular speaking elsewhere, as he said, and, as has been said by others, in the provinces, but as I should say, addressing my own constituents have I gone in one jot or little beyond the statements made by me on the floor of this House. I do not know really whether I am to look to the principles or to the practice of the noble Lord the Member for Stamford as establishing the rule with regard to what is to be done out of the House by its Members in the use of tongue or pen. I am quite willing, however, to say, without further examination of his practice, that I abide by his precepts; and this I promise him, I will freely submit to any censure he can bestow, and if censure is to be bestowed he is a good hand at it, when on any occasion he can show that I have said elsewhere of Members of this House, or of any proceeding in this House, that which I have not said here, or am not ready to say upon this floor, where in my judgment it is that all our battles may best be fought. I have a more agreeable admission to make. What I have said in the nature of platitudes, or of truisms, or of revolutionary maxims and the condemned dicta have passed under all these designations alternately as might suit the tastes of the different critics has been said with reference to declarations made by persons of the greatest weight in this House made, too, amid a tumult and tempest of cheers and therefore to be taken as setting forth the sentiments not of one but of many. Yet, I am glad and thankful to admit that those cheers and tumult, overpowering as they were, did not represent the universal sentiment on the other side of the House from which they proceeded. The hon. Gentleman the Member for South Lincolnshire explained that certain cheers, which had led me to suppose he might be one of those who enter- 122 tained opinions of the working class, such as I endeavoured to protest against, had been incorrectly interpreted, and really referred to another subject. My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Suffolk (Sir Fitz-Roy Kelly), although he has not taken part in this debate, spoke in another discussion upon the malt duty the other evening on the merits of the working class in a spirit which proves that he, at least, entertains none of those ungenerous sentiments in regard to them, and that tone, I feel assured, notwithstanding some instances leading to a contrary conclusion, largely pervades the Benches opposite. But I now pass on from the brief explanation which I have given of the particular epithets and expressions used by myself with reference to the sentiments of others, and I think I may appeal to hon. Members to support me when I say that it was not I who first introduced into these discussions observations of this colour and description. It was not in my opening speech that they had their rise, and so long as our debates are conducted in the manner of which the speech of the noble Lord opposite (Lord Stanley) has furnished us with so good an example I may, I hope, venture to promise that the House will never hear from me any more of such expressions, be they platitudes, be they the truth, or be they fairly characterized as revolutionary and subversive paradoxes. And now, Sir, I proceed. Now, I come to take a retrospect of this debate. It is natural, it is unavoidable, that my attention should first, and in a principal degree, rest on the remarkable speech which we heard yesterday from my right hon. Friend the Member for Calne. With that speech I shall not attempt to deal in detail, and that for many reasons. One of these reasons, perhaps, is a disinclination to measure swords with such a man. [""Hear, hear!""] That cheer, complimentary as it is, does not, at any rate, precede but follows my own admission. A second reason is in my recollection, and a third lies in my hopes with respect to my right hon. Friend. I cannot forget although e may his connection with the men who sit on these Benches. I cannot forget the services which, as a public man, he has rendered, and while I know of no language strong enough to express the grief nay, astonishment with which I regard his present extraordinary opinions on the question of Reform, passing, as they seemed to do, beyond those entertained, or at least those avowed by other Members,  123 yet I think the evident framework of his mind, as well as his recent conduct on other questions, entitles him to this admission at the hands of his party that he is pursuing the dictates of his conscience, and that upon general subjects his judgments are frankly liberal. I only hope that when he is again doing battle in the ranks and for the political objects of those among whom he sits, he may display a little more moderation than he has done in the course of the present struggle. With respect to his speech, I may be permitted to observe upon it in either of two aspects. When I look upon it in the light of a great Parliamentary display; when I consider the force of the weapons which he used, the keenness of their edge, and the skill and rapidity of the hand by which they were wielded, I am lost, indeed I was at the time lost, in admiration, though I was myself the object of a fair proportion of the cuts and thrusts which he delivered. But, Sir, when I take another view of that remarkable discourse; when I think of the end and aim to which it was applied when I think how shallow, unworthy, was the exhibition which he gave us of this great and noble Constitution of England, which I, for one, really thought had struck deep roots into our soil, and was fixed there in a manner to defy the puny efforts of my Lord Russell and his Colleagues when I recollect how my right hon. Friend, exaggerating more and more as he went on his fears and apprehensions, and colouring every object more and more highly in the phantom visions he raised up when I found him travelling back to Australia, his old abode, and on discovering there that the public men of that country had, after all, been prosecuting in his absence the career they commenced under his auspices, and when he ended with this portentous discovery that what he called anarchy must be arrested in the colonies by the paramount power of Parliamentary interference from this country for the purpose of taking away from our fellow-countrymen at the antipodes the powers of self-government which they enjoy, then I confess that the admiration I had felt was lost and swallowed up I will not say in shame but in grief. Will my right hon. Friend permit me to apply to him the story which is told of the mother of the Regent Duke of Orleans, Elizabeth the Princess Palatine of Bavaria. She said of her son, what I will venture to apply to my right hon. Friend. Her story was, that at his birth 124 the fairies were invited to attend. Each came, and each brought the infant the gift of a talent. But in sending the invitations one fairy had unhappily been forgotten. She came unasked, and said for her revenge, ""Yes, he shall have all the talents except one, that of knowing how and for what end to apply them."" The argument of my right hon. Friend depended entirely on a series of unsound and what I may call enormous assumptions. The first which I shall deal with is the assumption that the Government has insulted the House of Commons. Insult, vilification, degradation, harshness, tyranny, despotism these are some of the flowers of speech which have been applied in the course of this debate by my noble Friend the Member for Haddington, on the part of those whom he calls moderate Liberals, and by others to the conduct of the Government. But, to do him justice, my right hon. Friend never deals in generalities, so he fastened on a phrase. He thinks he substantiated his charge by saying that I had used these words, ""We know with whom we have to deal."" The right hon. Gentleman says that phrase means the House of Commons; and, consequently, that the House of Commons is insulted. But did it mean the House of Commons? It did not. There is no more common political artifice, as far as my experience goes, than this when a gentleman finds himself stung or fastened down, or aptly described by some particular phrase or sentiment, he shifts the application of it from himself, and he complains that it has been applied, and, of course, disrespectfully applied to the House of Commons. Sir, I did not apply my phrase to the House of Commons. I will explicitly tell my right hon. Friend to whom I did not apply it, and, if it be any satisfaction to him, I will tell him also to whom I did apply it. I did not apply it to my right hon, Friend the Member for Cambridge University, or to the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Oxfordshire, both of whom, as we perfectly well know, are friendly to a reduction of the borough franchise. We may, indeed, have a battle with my right hon. Friend (Mr. Walpole) at the proper time, for he declares, although I own myself unable to perceive it, that a principle is involved in the difference between the rates of PS10 and PS14 as applied to the counties, and between the amounts PS7 and PS8 as applied to the boroughs. But he is friendly to the reduction of the franchise in boroughs. He has declared  125 his opinions, and no doubt he will be ready at the proper time to vote in conformity with them. His whole conduct has been open and direct. If I had applied such an expression to him I should have been guilty of the grossest injustice. I had in my mind very different persons. Does my right hon. Friend the Member for Calne recollect how, in one of his plays, that prince of comedians, Aristophanes conveys, through the medium of some character or other, a rebuke to some prevailing tendency or sentiment of the time I cannot recollect now what it was too many are the years that have slipped away since I read it but that character, addressing the audience, says, ""But now, my good Athenians, pray recollect I am not speaking of the city, I am not speaking of the public, I am only speaking of certain depraved and crooked little men."" And if I may be permitted to make a metaphorical application of these epithets confining myself most strictly to the metaphorical use, speaking only in a political sense, and with exclusive reference to this question of Reform, I would say it was not of the House of Commons, but of ""certain depraved and crooked little men"" that I used these words, and I frankly own now in candour my right hon. Friend is, according to my judgment and intention, first and foremost among them. ""We know with whom we have to deal,"" because we know we have to deal with him. My right hon. Friend is opposed to the lowering of the borough franchise. He knows that is the object of this Bill. If I understood his speech aright, and he is so perspicuous that it is hardly possible to be mistaken, he is opposed to Reform in every shape and form; yet, though he is opposed to the measure as a whole, he does not oppose the second reading of the Bill, but has been content to vote for an Amendment which, in effect, says no more than this, ""We think that a bad Bill which is already on the table, but you must lay another bad Bill on the table, and then we will consider it."" I think, therefore, that I am justified in using the words, significant as I admit them to be, ""we know with whom we have to deal."" We have to deal with Gentlemen who are opposed to the reduction of the franchise, but who do not think proper to express the ground of their opposition by their vote. The course we have taken is a course that we have taken avowedly upon a principle. We do not deny, we do not dispute, that we are contending for the re- 126 duction of the franchise. We are not now contending for a particular amount. We may mean to propose, and we may mean to adhere to a particular amount; but what we are now contending for is a reduction of the franchise. But we are opposed by open antagonists, and we are also opposed by concealed antagonists. We wish to strip away the disguise from this latter class of antagonists. We wish that they should speak audibly, and in the face of day that which they think, that which they mean; and no effort, Sir, on our part, no amount of endurance, no amount of labour than we can give, shall be wanting to attain that object, and to take care that the people of England, as well as we, the Government, shall know with whom we have to deal. Then the second head of my right hon. Friend's indictment against us as to insulting this House was that after we had produced a certain quantity of statistics, we declared it should not, with our good will, have any more. Sir, I never said anything of the kind. What I said was, that when questions respecting the social anatomy of class, and the conditions and the numbers in particular of the working class reached a point, which, I say frankly, appeared to me to threaten to assume an invidious and offensive character I mean justly offensive to them what I did say was that it was time such inquiries should stop, and that as far as the Government was concerned, we would be no party to their being carried to that point. As to further statistics, Members know the reverse; for example, the hon. Member for Northamptonshire knows well that on the very same night when this matter was under discussion, the Government made not the smallest objection to the production of the statistics which he desired. But my right hon. Friend says and I think this was the third proof he gave that we were insulting the House he says that the information on the subject of the redistribution of seats, that is, the measure which we intend to propose on that subject, is kept back out of mere wantonness. And the task he commends to me is this I have to show, he conceives, that that measure is so entirely detached from the considerations applicable to the second reading of our present Bill, that it ought upon no account to be given to the House before such second reading, and yet that it is so intimately intertwined with the considerations applicable to the Motion for going  127 into Committee that it must of necessity be given to the House before it is about to go into Committee. Sir, I am bound to prove, and I shall prove no such thing. It is not we who have ever held that the measure for re-distribution was so intertwined with the second reading of this Bill that it must necessarily be given before? we could go into Committee. On the contrary, Sir, we have frankly declared, knowing, as I said before, with whom we have to deal, that the great apprehension which possessed us was not one merely respecting the course that would on that night be taken by the representatives of the small boroughs, naturally and not unwarrantably alarmed on behalf of their constituents. That is a comparatively small matter. But our main dread was that the covert enemies of the reduction of the franchise would make use of that whole wilderness of multitudinous particulars which belongs to the subject, a re-distribution of seats, to perplex and entangle the whole question so as to render progress with it virtually impracticable within the time likely to be at our command. That was the fear we entertained. But as time went on we found that many differed from us as to our mode of procedure, with respect to whom it would have been insolence on our part to doubt that they at the same time concurred with us in a common object namely, in desiring a reduction of the franchise. Without the smallest reserve, therefore, and in deference to those wishes, we departed from the method of action which our own judgment recommended, and we incurred what we thought real hazard and inconvenience as far as the progress of the measure is concerned. We have, however, adhered all along to the opinion we originally expressed that the safest course, could we have persuaded the House to pursue it, would have been a complete separation for the moment of the two subjects. I say for the moment, because I am now reminded that I omitted to notice, I believe at the proper time, one point in regard to the opinions of the hon. Member for Birmingham. That particular opinion of my hon. Friend that the re-distribution of seats was a question to be reserved with a view to an intermediate ripening of the public mind on the subject was an opinion that we have never entertained. It was an opinion that my hon. Friend might entertain with perfect honour; but for us who had formerly combined the two subjects, and for those who now professed to 128 disunite them exclusively upon grounds of convenience and advantage in point of procedure for us to entertain such a latent purpose would have been a base device, would have been conduct unworthy either of a Government or of any gentleman or any reputable man in whatever capacity or station. And I must confess it is with pain that I can with difficulty allow myself to believe that any such opinion can have been entertained of the Government by any Gentleman who numbers himself among its supporters. I cannot complain or wonder at its being ascribed to us by Gentlemen opposite, for the distinction which the hon. and gallant Member for Huntingdon has made between personal and political honour is a distinction which has been at least conventionally established to a sufficient degree to warrant charges of that kind; but I must say that for Gentlemen who have general confidence in the Government, to think the Government capable of any such act is a thing I am at a loss to understand, and the advice I would respectfully presume to give them is, that they withdraw that general confidence immediately, and make it their first business not to carry an indirect Motion like the Amendment now under consideration, but to put the Government out of office by the most direct and summary means they can discover. Thus much, Sir, as to insulting the House by withholding information. And now, Sir, I hope I may say a few words as to the general charge of an attempt to domineer or tyrannize over this House. The right hon. Gentleman opposite has given me a favourable opportunity of explaining my position to the Liberal party on that subject. If, Sir, I had been the man who at the very outset of his career, well nigh half a century ago, had with an almost prophetic foresight fastened upon two great groups of questions the great historic questions of the day, of which the right hon. Gentleman opposite, from the last portion of his speech, seems never to have heard; I mean the questions relating to the removal of civil disabilities for religious opinions, and to Parliamentary Reform if I had been the man who halting thus in early youth, in the first stage of his political career, fixed upon those questions and made them his own, then went on and prosecuted them with sure and unflagging instinct until the triumph in both cases was achieved; if I had been the man whose name has been associated for forty years, and often in the very first  129 place of eminence, with every measure of beneficent legislation in other words, had I been Earl Russell, there might have been some temptation to pass into excess in the exercise of authority, and to apply a pressure to this House in itself unjustifiable. But, Sir, I am not Earl Russell. The right hon. Gentleman, secure I suppose in the recollection of his own consistency, has taunted me with the political errors of my boyhood. The right hon. Gentleman when he addressed the hon. Member for Westminster, took occasion to show his magnanimity, for he declared that he would not take the philosopher to task for what he wrote twenty-five years ago. But when he caught one who thirty-five years ago, who, just emerged from boyhood, and still an undergraduate at Oxford, had expressed an opinion adverse to the Reform Bill of 1832, of which he had so long and bitterly repented, then the right hon. Gentleman could not resist the temptation that offered itself to his appetite for effect. He, a Parliamentary champion of twenty years' standing, and the leader, as he informs us to-night of the Tory party, is so ignorant of the House of Commons, or so simple in the structure of his mind, that he positively thought he would obtain a Parliamentary advantage by exhibiting me to the public view for reprobation as an opponent of the Reform Bill of 1832. Sir, as the right hon. Gentleman has done me the honour thus to exhibit me, let me for a moment trespass on the patience of the House to exhibit myself. What he has stated is true. I deeply regret it. But I was bred under the shadow of the great name of Canning; every influence connected with that name governed the first political impressions of my childhood and my youth; with Mr. Canning I rejoiced in the removal of religious disabilities from the Roman Catholic body, and in the free and truly British tone which he gave to our policy abroad; with Mr. Canning I rejoiced in the opening he made towards the establishment of free commercial interchanges between nations; with Mr. Canning and under the shadow of that great name, and under the shadow of the yet more venerable name of Burke, I grant my youthful mind and imagination were impressed with the same idle and futile fears which still bewilder and distract the mature mind of the right hon. Gentleman. I had conceived that very same fear, that ungovernable alarm at the first Reform Bill in the days of my undergraduate career at Oxford which the right 130 hon. Gentleman now feels; and the only difference between us is this I thank him for bringing it into view by his quotation that, having those views, I, as it would appear, moved the Oxford Union Debating Society to express them clearly, plainly, forcibly, in downright English, while the right hon. Gentleman does not dare to tell the nation what it is that he really thinks, and is content to skulk under the shelter of the meaningless Amendment which is proposed by the noble Lord. And now, Sir, I quit the right hon. Gentleman; I leave him to his reflections, and I envy him not one particle of the polemical advantage which he has gained by his discreet reference to the proceedings of the Oxford Union Debating Society in the year of grace 1831. My position then, Sir, in regard to the Liberal party is in all points the opposite of Earl Russell's. Earl Russell might have been misled possibly, had he been in this place, into using language which would have been unfit coming from another person. But it could not be the same with me. I am too well aware of the relations which subsist between the party and myself. I have none of the claims he possesses. I came among you an outcast from those with whom I associated, driven from them, I admit, by no arbitrary act, but by the slow and resistless forces of conviction. I came among you, to make use of the legal phraseology, in pauperis forma. I had nothing to offer you but faithful and honourable service. You received me, as Dido received the shipwrecked Eneas  ""Ejectum littore egentem Accepi  And I only trust you may not hereafter at any time have to complete the sentence in regard to me  ""Et regni demons in parte locavi."" You received me with kindness, indulgence, generosity, and I may even say with some measure of confidence. And the relation between us has assumed such a form that you never can be my debtors, but that I must for ever be in your debt. It is not for me, under such circumstances, that any word will proceed that can savour of the character which the right hon. Gentleman imputes to the conduct of the Government with respect to the present Bill. Now, Sir let me state what I take to be the actual condition of the question that is to be decided to-night. For this is not  131 only a protracted debate it is not only one upon which the House of Commons has freely lavished from every one of its quarters or its sections the choicest treasures of its wit, its argument, its rhetorical, and its persuasive powers it is also an historical debate. We are now about the process what is called ""making History."" We are now laying the foundations of much that is to come. This occasion is a starting-point from which I presume to think the career we have to run as individuals and parties will in many respects take its character and colour. Now, Sir, the main charge brought against us is this that we have introduced a Franchise Bill alone. Is that, then, a very grave offence? There were two reasons that might, surely, without reproach have moved us to take such a course. One was the reason of policy the desire to avoid inviting unnecessarily an independent combination of persons, and causing them to join on different grounds for the common and momentary purpose of rejecting the Bill. If we were influenced by that motive, I do not know in confessing the fact we need in any way be ashamed of it. But the conclusive reason which swayed us was that which I mentioned in introducing the Bill the feeling that the passing of a combined Bill must be regarded as impossible; that under the circumstances which then existed it was not possible for us to ask the House to continue its sittings through the autumn, that the time which we must reckon as likely to be consumed in debate upon the double measure would be more than we could make sure, within the ordinary limits of the Session, we should be able to devote to it, and that, consequently, it we introduced a measure which we knew could not in the ordinary course of things pass the House in the time available for its discussion not only would there be another failure to be added to the already long list of failures, but one attended on our part with gross dishonour. We should have met with all and more than all the opposition which has encountered us, although not, perhaps, from the same quarters. And we should have had to boot the reproach from within, that we had adopted an indirect method of proceeding, and had claimed credit for being the friends of Reform, while we had laid upon the table a measure which we ourselves knew it was impossible to dispose of. This second and conclusive reason was, then, the question of time. It was the twelve- 132 day or twenty-four day argument which has attained such considerable celebrity, and on which my mind dwells with peculiar satisfaction, because it seems to have been the only point of all those mooted in this debate on which everybody has been agreed. No one, at least, has challenged it. That argument of time was also for us, under the circumstances, an argument of honour; and the noble Lord the Member for King's Lynn owned that the alternative to our method of proceeding was the postponement of the whole question to next Session. Now, after what has passed, let the noble Lord place himself in our position. I ask the noble Lord, for I have confidence in his fairness, to place himself in our position. We were the authors, most of us, of measures which had resulted in two or three former failures. We had taken part, most of us, in the strong and decisive measure which resulted in the ejection of the Government of Lord Derby upon a Bill relating to this very same subject. We had postponed for several years after that resolution the resumption of the subject which was dropped in 1860. We found upon inquiry last autumn that we could obtain in time to legislate all the information which appeared to us to be needed in order to enable Parliament to deal with the franchise. Was it, then, so great an offence, one which deserved to be visited with such severity, that we thought it more honourable to ourselves and more honourable to our party to do at once that which we found we could do at once, and to postpone to a later stage that which absolutely required to be postponed? Was it so strange a thing that after four Reform Bills had failed, and failed egregiously, we should think of varying their form, of removing some of the cargo from the ship? Was not that, indeed, the natural course to pursue when it had been found impossible to navigate her with the whole of it aboard? And again, Sir, had the House of Commons evinced a deliberate determination on former occasions only to deal with the extension of the franchise and the re-distribution of seats as one measure the case would have been different. But no such determination had been announced, nor can any such opinion be found upon the records or inferred from the acts of the House. In the many debates which have taken place upon the Bill with respect to the county franchise, introduced by the hon. Member for West Surrey, it was never  133 urged that that measure must of necessity be combined with a proposal for the re-distribution of seats, nor have suggestions of this kind been ordinarily made, if my memory serves me right, in the debates which have taken place upon the Bill introduced by the hon. Member for Leeds to effect a reduction of the borough franchise. Again, Sir, is not Ireland a case eminently in point? Does not Ireland present to us the smallest borough constituencies in the Kingdom? And yet we proceeded without scruple in the case of Ireland in the very same manner we have adopted. We added 100,000 or 150,000, or, as I have seen it stated, a yet larger number of voters to the constituencies of Ireland, and still we hate never touched the question of re-distribution at all. And yet, because we have adopted a similar course, our conduct is regarded as something monstrous, and as justifying every kind of strange and dishonouring suspicion. And now, Sir, I will turn to another head of evidence. Let us see what hon. Gentlemen say when they go to their constituents. That is a description of evidence to which, in my opinion, much weight should be attached, because the sentiments of hon. Gentlemen on such occasions are dictated not only by reason but by instinct by that instinct which as an inward monitor teaches them what to say when they go before the arbiters of their fate. I have been rather curious in examining the addresses of hon. Gentlemen, and I find that there were 117 borough Members who entered into particulars on the subject of Reform, and did not refer to it simply on general terms. Out of these, no more than sixteen referred to the question of the re-distribution of seats; and I believe that every one of those sixteen members who have testified in this unequivocal manner to their belief in the importance of re-distribution of seats, is going to vote with the Government in favour of the present Bill. The remaining 101 declared themselves at the election upon the franchise alone. Whether some of them may since have become conscious of the great importance of the re-distribution of Beats I do not know; but on referring to the names, I find that the vast' majority of those who think the subject of Reform is worth introducing at all refer to it in making their profession of a political creed, simply in connection with and for its most important branch the extension of the franchise. Therefore, Sir, I must say I do not think 134 it can be shown that any great reproach attaches to the Government for the course which it has adopted. Now, Sir, I come to the language that has been held about the inconvenience of the separation? The noble Lord opposite (Lord Stanley) has argued this part of the question very high. I do not blame the noble Lord for what I certainly thought a strain of great exaggeration. I will only say this, I doubt whether it was altogether consistent in the speaker of the speech. For what was the noble Lord's course in 1859? The noble Lord objects to anything lying in prospect only; he wants to have everything in hand. Is that so? There are two heads under which this objection arises; one is with respect to boundaries, and the right hon. Gentleman (Mr. Disraeli) has shown to-night that is much the greater of the two in his opinion. The other has reference to the re-distribution of seats. How did the noble Lord stand with respect to the question of boundaries? Though the Government of which he was a Member had been twelve months in office when they brought in their Bill, though they had ample time for ascertaining all the facts, and for proposing an exact system of delimitation to Parliament, they made no such proposal all they did was to insert a clause directing that inquiries should be made, which inquiries were to be made after the Bill should have passed, and to be followed by a Bill for fixing boundaries. So that as to this head the noble Lord did the very thing which he charges us with doing. And what did he do with respect to re-distribution? He put in fifteen seats in his Bill; it was not much, but it was the best part of the measure; the other provisions of the Bill of 1859 were such as I would rather not now describe. Well, the noble Lord put in fifteen seats, and having thus satisfied himself, he also proposed to fix a certain rate for the borough and county franchise, and then said, ""Though we give you only fifteen seats now, it is because we cannot do more at present; but if you look at the borough and county franchise, you will see that as they are now to be identified bye-and-bye you can re-distribute seats as much as you like."" Thus, having by the Bill thrown the entire question of boundaries bodily into the future, and having left the question of redistribution, in a great measure, to stand over for its real settlement at some time perfectly undetermined, the noble Lord now comes down and delivers this admirable  135 speech admirable except for the speaker on the intolerable inconvenience of making any separation at all, between the question of the franchise and the determination of the constituencies among which the seats are to be divided. And now, Sir, I wish to say one word on an illustration used by the noble Lord. Not the figure of the House, for that was well answered by my hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor General for Scotland, who reminded him that we were not going to build a house, for we have got a very good one. But I refer to the illustration which the noble Lord drew from the subject of finance. ""But,"" said the noble Lord, ""In finance you would never do this, for in finance the House always has the whole scheme before it."" But does the noble Lord forget that controversy of historic fame which closed about four or five years ago, when, for the special purpose of the protection of its privileges, the House thought fit to unite all its taxes and all its chief financial measures for the year in one Bill? Until that year the practice had been to pass all the financial proposals as independent Bills, subject to all the risks which the noble Lord described, and all the dangers and inconveniences which he conjured up, and presented to our view as attendant upon severances of this kind. But who were the defenders of that separate legislation? Why, all it defenders came from behind the noble Lord; they were the very same men who to-night I suppose will crowd one of the lobbies of the House to sustain a vote in flat contrariety to the rule laid down by the noble Lord. My right hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge made what I must frankly call a commendable and in intention a helpful suggestion. Why do not you proceed by Resolution? he asked. I thank him for it, because I am certain of the spirit in which that suggestion was offered. But had my right hon. Friend thought of the meaning of proceeding by Resolution? We could easily conceive I think, how our first Resolution would be framed; it might be very short, for it would not require much explanation. It would be easy to put into a few Resolutions so much of the Bill as related to the franchise; but I want to know how he would have put the re-distribution of seats into the form of a Resolution? Would he have a Resolution declaring that it is expedient to take away so many Members from thirty or forty boroughs; and would 136 he name those boroughs? If he did not name them the Resolution would be meaningless; and if he did name them, what, I ask, would be the difference between the Resolution and a Bill for re-distribution, so far as regards the main point in issue namely, the gaining time by avoiding multiplied topics of debate. Nothing would be gained by that course. I fully appreciate the suggestion, but I am bound to say I do not think we have incurred an evil result or deserved any blame for not adopting it. Now, Sir, what is the real state of the case with regard to distribution? This is very much at the root of our present difficulty. My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham has said truly that it is conceivable that you may have a scheme of re-distribution such as altogether to frustrate and to intercept the effect of your reduction of the franchise. If we were to introduce a scheme of that kind I admit that everything that has been said against us would be just. But, Sir, we are not persons who have given no indication in former times of our views of re-distribution. My belief is that re-distribution, though an exceedingly important subject, is secondary altogether to the franchise, because it is limited by and regulated upon principles which I think afford little room for difference of opinion among fair-minded and moderate men. The re-distributions of the Bill of 1854, of the Bill of 1859, and of the Bill of 1860 have proceeded upon one and the same set of principles namely to abridge the representation in one portion of our system, by taking Members from the boroughs of small populations, and to give the seats thus obtained in such proportion as might be thought fair between the new towns and such of the counties and large towns already represented as might appear to have just claims to an increase of representation. Such are the principles; but of course there must be some variety in the mode of applying them. In that view of the subject I think any reasonable man will see that there is nothing at all that can vitally affect in any manner a Bill which extends the franchise. The Bill I think of the right hon. Gentleman and Lord Derby proposed to enfranchise seven towns. Birkenhead has since been enfranchised; but six of those boroughs still remain, and their population averages 20,000, so that altogether the population numbers 120,000. Take 120,000 people out of the counties;  137 what is the number of PS7 voters which would by such a measure be brought into existence? It is not worth considering for a moment. The right hon. Gentleman did, indeed, I think, state that there were 2,000,000 or 3,000,000 of people in the counties that might properly be withdrawn from them and included within the towns. I grant that if you approach the subject of re-distribution with the intention of what is commonly called ""cooking the constituency,"" you will, by seeking to destroy the effects of the reduction of the franchise by the re-distribution of seats, make re-distribution a most dangerous engine. We disclaim all such intentions. I think our former conduct ought to acquit us of any such intentions. But if such intentions be imputed to us, it ought to be by our enemies, for such intentions are not to be imputed compatibly with political friendship. We consider it to be the proper purpose of redistribution by moderate and reasonable changes to second the provisions of the law touching the franchise, not covertly to neutralize and overturn them. Now, Sir, we have been asked to do some things, and we have done them. But let us just consider what they are and what they are not. It has been stated, and stated assiduously, that we have said that re-distribution must be postponed for another year, and that nothing could be done on that subject until the Franchise Bill became law. We have said neither one nor the other. We have never refused any request or suggestion to proceed with re-distribution during the present year. We said that we should not proceed with the plan of re-distribution until in our judgment the fate of the Franchise Bill had been secured. But that is a very different thing. That security may become apparent at different stages of the progress, according as circumstances happen, which can only be judged of at the moment. But as to the postponement of the Re-distribution Bill for another year, we have not said anything of the sort. I myself, in the name of the Government, distinctly pointed out that if it were the pleasure of the House, in its anxiety for a prompt settlement of the whole subject of Reform, to prolong its sittings during the autumn the Government would not be the parties to object. But, strange to say, although that offer was intelligibly given, not a single one of the Gentlemen who are so keen for considering re-distribution with the question of the franchise has let fall a syllable showing a disposition to agree to 138 that proposal. We said that in our opinion the re-distribution of seats formed an essential part of Reform; we said the political engagement on which we stake our existence as a Government is not confined to the Franchise Bill, but extends to the subject of re-distribution; and we said the process of re-distribution, if there were a mind to undertake it with despatch, should not be interrupted by any tardiness or laziness of ours. We are taunted, and not altogether unjustly, by the right hon. Gentleman opposite with having changed our front, because we have made this further concession in order to meet the views of Gentlemen whom we believe to be united with ourselves in the object that we have in view that we will lay the Bill for the re-distribution of seats upon the table before asking the House to go into Committee upon the Bill relating to the franchise. And now, Sir, I may fairly ask, what more is desired? Let us hear what is asked, that we may consider whether, compatibly with the main design we have in view, we can give our assent to the demand? The noble Lord the Member for King's Lynn, says, ""Give us a guarantee that if the Franchise Bill passes, the Re-distribution Bill shall also pass."" Is the noble Lord so much afraid of the consequences of failure as to forget that if our plan of re-distribution fails the Government must fail with it, and consequently that if he is so keen for re-distribution, that he can come in himself and carry his own. The noble Lord is afraid of a dissolution. But there can, I think, be nothing more obvious than this, that the Government having produced these two Bills will have every conceivable motive of a selfish kind for avoiding a dissolution until both the one and the other shall have passed. We shall have conciliated a few, while proceed as cautiously as we may we shall have offended many. If you think we may have some favour and interest with the constituencies likely to be enfranchised, it is in your power to gain as great an interest in them, should you but have the wisdom and forethought to desist from the course that you are now pursuing, and to show a little less mistrust of them that portion of your fellow-countrymen should you for example henceforward refrain from insisting that to allow them to possess the franchise is to Americanize our institutions. I wish to be clearly understood upon the question connected with the form and manner of proceeding with the measure,  139 especially after it has been repeatedly stated in debate that there are various rumours circulating in the House. I believe there are Gentlemen who desire of us more than we have promised to do, who are not satisfied with our having said that the Re-distribution Bill should be placed in their possession immediately after the second reading of the measure that is now before them. Let me endeavour, then, to be clear upon this subject. Our object is to draw a separation broadly and unequivocally between those who really desire a reduction of the franchise in counties, and, above all, in boroughs, and those who do not, but who are apparently disposed to make use of the question of the re-distribution of seats, and of every other topic, for the purpose of concealing their hostility and yet effectively prosecuting their opposition to the reduction of the franchise. Now, Sir, I have to say that the Government will be l0th to quarrel upon any mere question of procedure with any Gentleman in whom we recognize a community of object and purpose with ourselves. If Gentlemen have the same end in view, we shall have every disposition, as far as we can contrive it, to adopt the same means. We hold every subject of procedure to be wholly secondary to the purpose for which it is intended. What we cannot do, however, is this we cannot undertake to abandon the ground we have gained, for, in my opinion, we have gained ground. We will not undertake to forego the fruit of the labours which the House has bestowed on that part of the Session which is past; and we cannot undertake to waste that portion of the Session which is yet to come. We will not, as far as depends upon us, either encourage or endure procrastination. I must in the plainest manner convey to my noble Friend the Member for Chester that we will be no parties to procrastination; and that no concealment shall subsist if we have the power to pierce it, and to unveil to the public whatever is beneath. That, Sir, is the state of the case with regard to our intentions upon what may happen after the second reading of this Bill. Now, Sir, in a great question like this, it is well understood what is really involved in the second reading. Let it be clearly understood that we are not now debating the rejection or acceptance of clauses secondary with reference to the main purpose of the Bill. It is no question of savings banks, it is no question of dockyard enfranchise- 140 ment; nor is it even a question concerning the votes of leaseholders in counties. And here I will, in passing, make an admission to my right hon. Friend the Member for North Staffordshire. He has certainly surprised me by the number of votes which he states would be added to the register of a particular division of a county under the operation of this clause. I do not know that his estimate is precisely correct; I may have occasion to question it. We have proposed the clause I am referring to under the belief that, as a general and almost universal rule, the number of those leaseholding votes are comparatively few. If that be not so, it is a question undoubtedly open to re-consideration. Nor, of course, are we at this moment asking of any Gentleman to pledge himself as to the particular figure at which he will fix the reduced franchise in counties, nor even in boroughs. We do not conceal our intentions. We do not hold out the smallest expectation that we shall deviate from our position in this respect; we cannot depart from it. But that is not the point to be decided to-night. The point we are to decide to-night is whether the House will, by a majority, vote for the second rending of this Bill that is to say, for a measure affirming the reduction of the franchise in counties, and especially in towns. That is the question. [""No, no !""and Cheers.] It may not be the question in the estimation of the hon. Gentleman; but it seems not improper that those who move the second reading of a Bill should at any rate put the House in possession of what they know to be the intention of the movers, and what they believe to be, and so far as depends on them intend should be, the true significance of the vote for which they ask. Have we, then, good reason for asking that this Bill should be read a second time in lieu of adopting the Motion of the noble Earl? I think we have very sound reasons for asking it. They are these. We gave notice that we would introduce a measure of Reform, and we produced the Bill. We were saluted by my noble Friend with a hostile Motion, and a Motion framed in concert with the party in Opposition. [""No, no !""and"" Hear, hear !""] On a former occasion I endeavoured to do justice to the moderation of my noble Friend's character. I wish now to bear testimony to the moderation and mildness of his language. But the moderation and mildness of his language cannot blind the Government to the seve-  141 rity of his act. He spoke of his being a follower of Earl Russell, but the Amendment coming from my noble Friend has been concerted with the party opposite. [An hon. MEMBER: I do not believe it was.] [Much laughter.] I am bound to say that I am unable to recognize the hon. Member as the leader of the party opposite. I recognize the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Bucks as filling that position, and no one else. But, returning to the Amendment; I am not aware of any case, within our Parliamentary experience, or of any case whatever, in which a Government has consented to accept such an Amendment, so prepared and so produced. I frankly own that if I were to be dragged at the chariot-wheels of any man, I would be as willing to be dragged at the chariot-wheels of my noble Friend as at those of any one whom I have the honour to know. But that is a process to which a Government cannot and must not submit. I marked the words of my noble Friend, looking back at his conduct in 1859. He was then so zealous for a reduction of the borough franchise, that he would not hear of the proposal to read the Bill of that day a second time, because it did not propose such reduction. My noble Friend now repents of that refusal. He says it was a very unwise proceeding. He holds that, having then before them a Government which had introduced a Reform Bill, and which were pledged to stand or fall by it, to stop the Government in its career was not the way to promote the cause of Reform. But, strange inconsistency of human nature not peculiar to my noble Friend, but only too common in the annals of casuistry ! For a moment, and with evident sincerity, he repents; but at the same moment the temptation again presents itself, and again he falls. In the very act of making the confession he repeats and revives the offence. My noble Friend now in truth asks the House to do over again what he laments that it did in 1859. We ask that our Bill may be read a second time. Is our request an unfair one? My right hon. Friend the Member for Calne quoted yesterday, and with great effect, a phrase which has been used by Mr. Hallam. Mr. Hallam says very truly that Ministers have a double allegiance an allegiance to the Crown, and an allegiance to this House. It is their business, in submitting their measures to the judgment of the House, to consider what their own honour requires; but it is also their duty 142 in deciding as they best can what is expedient for the public interests to consider what may be required for the honour, dignity, and efficiency of the House. Well, Sir, after all that has happened after the many Bills which have been brought in after the many unforeseen obstacles ending in miscarriage after the equivocal and questionable proceedings that have at times been taken with reference to these measures, and the jealousies and reproaches which the public do not understand, but of which they see the effect in the total stoppage of the movement of Reform we have deliberately thought we were entitled, nay that we were bound, to ask the House for an answer on the question of the reduction of the franchise in counties and boroughs a question which cannot be affected in its substance by any course which we can pursue with regard to the redistribution of seats. That is what we have thought, and I think I may ask my noble Friend whether we are not perfectly entitled to ask for that answer. Sir, there was a wish expressed by one of the heroes of that ancient war to which my right hon. Friend and myself have so often referred, a wish eminently suitable to the present position of Her Majesty's Government. It is this  ""Let us die in the daylight."" Now, I ask it of my noble Friend that we may die in the daylight. My noble Friend's hostility to this Bill and the fact of such hostility is notorious, for it was declared in his address to his constituents is not founded upon the circumstance of its not containing clauses for re-distribution, but on the fact of its being a Bill for the reduction of the franchise in boroughs. My noble Friend differs vitally from the Government on that subject. I do not complain of that difference of opinion. On the contrary, I honour him for acting according to his own opinion; but I do not think it too much to ask that he should state it in plain words. He asks, however, for a Re-distribution Bill with the Franchise Bill. But suppose a Re-distribution Bill of an unobjectionable character were introduced, would my noble Friend then support the Franchise Bill? I think that is a fair challenge. I think that upon the answer to that challenge, or upon the non-answer to it,' which will mean pretty much the same thing, the judgment of the House and of the country may very well be taken. The right hon. Gentleman the Member  143 for Calne has said that we hare given no reasons for our Bill; and he likewise said that we know nothing of those 204,000 persons, whom it is proposed to enfranchise in boroughs; indeed, as I think, he repeated the assertion several times. What, Sir, do we know nothing of those 204,000? Does my right hon. Friend know nothing of them? We were taught to think he knew a good deal about them. We have not yet wholly forgotten his own significant words so loudly cheered: ""we know what sort of men live in these houses."" My right hon. Friend will recollect the words well enough. They were used in his first speech. They formed part of his declamatory denunciation against the admission of any class below the &10 voters to the franchise. Nor was this all. Who were those Hyperboreans of the speech of my right hon. Friend? And what was the wind that got colder as the traveller went further north? Was not the comparison this that as on the earth's surface the cold increases as we move in that direction, so in the downward figures of the franchise the voters became progressively more drunken, or more venal, or, to refrain from recalling those words, I would say simply more and more unfit? Now, Sir, we too know something of those men, but what we know is very different from the supposed knowledge of my right hon. Friend. The right hon. Gentleman asked, ""Do you think the franchise is good in itself, or do you wish to improve the institutions of the country?"" Sir, I find here no dilemma. My answer is, we want to do both. The extension of the franchise within safe and proper limits is good. It will array more persons in support of the institutions of the country, and that is another good. The composition and the working of this House is admirable, and its performances have long since placed it at the head of all the legislative assemblies of the world. It does not follow, however, that it cannot be improved. I will not say with my right hon. Friend that it is perfect. I am not sure, indeed, that he said so, but he seemed to mean if not to say it. I am not prepared to pay the worship of idolatry even to this House. I will mention a point in which I think it might be improved. It is this. I need not say I am scarcely speaking of the present House, which has but just entered upon its labours. I am speaking of the reformed Parliament in general. There is a saying which has been ascribed to a very eminent person, still 144 alive whose name I will not mention because I have no means of knowing whether it has been truly ascribed to him or not, but I will quote it for its own sake. It is to the effect that the unreformed Parliament used to job for individuals, while the reformed Parliament jobs for classes. I do not adopt the rudeness of the phrase, but the substance of the observation is in my opinion just. I think that the influence of separate classes is too strong, and that the influence of the public interest properly so called, as distinguished from the interest of sets, groups, and classes of men, is too weak. I fully admit I am not perhaps altogether an impartial judge; I speak much from my own experience during a lengthened period as Chancellor of the Exchequer, and as in a special degree and sense the guardian of the public purse. Undoubtedly, if there be a weak point in the composition of the House this is the department in which it would most readily and most clearly show itself. I believe that the composition of the House might be greatly improved; and that the increased representation of the working classes would supply us more largely with that description of Members whom we want, who would look not to the interests of classes, hut to the public interest. In presuming to say so much as this, I hope I do not convey any reproach to any party or person; but my right hon. Friend (Mr. Lowe) challenged us so sharply, as if we admitted that no improvement whatever was possible, that I felt bound to state my belief. Again, Sir, I return to the broad proposition of my right hon. Friend. He says we have no reasons. Perhaps he does not admit as a reason what was stated the other day by the hon. Member for Birmingham, that there have been a hundred meetings public meetings held in favour of this Bill. I observed, when those words were spoken, that loud murmurs arose on the other side of the House at the mention of the number, and I have not the least doubt of their good faith. I, however, was persuaded that the hon. Member for Birmingham was right, and turning to the Report of the Committee on Public Petitions, I counted the meetings. [An Opposition MEMBER: Got up!] The meetings are ""got up!"" are they? Then you have your remedy. Do you get up meetings against the measure? It will then be seen whether it is or is not an easy matter to get an expression of public senti-  145 ment on which to found your operations. I know not whether they are ""got up"" or not; if Gentlemen think they are, it is open to them who think so to try the experiment the other way. But this I know, that I counted the petitions presented from public meetings, and signed by the chairmen of these meetings individually, and I found that between the 11th and the 17th of April there were 187 such petitions, besides 500,000 or 600,000 signatures from individuals in favour of this Bill. So much then, Sir, I say as respects that description of argument which may with fairness be drawn within certain bounds, from the evident and expressed opinion of the country. But now I have to grapple with the principal argument, if such it be, of my right hon. Friend the Member for Calne, and to confront all the dismal pictures he draws of the destruction of the British Constitution. My answer is, that it is not going to be destroyed. We are not going to import American principles. It is not an American principle to reduce the borough franchise. It is a return to old English principles it is a restoration of the state and course of things that subsisted before, and ought to subsist again, What has happened since 1832? I am now going to state a part of the case on the authority of the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Oxfordshire (Mr. Henley)  ""The working people have been having a less and less share in the representation. They had a considerable representation before 1832, through the scot-and-lot voters and the freemen. I am not going to say anything either for or against the freemen; but through them the working class had their voice in the representation. They are gradually dying out."" [3 Hansard, clii. 1066.] That was the emphatic statement of the right hon. Gentleman in 1859; and has it been counteracted since? No; it has not been counteracted, not even, as I believe, in the least degree, certainly not to any considerable extent. I will now state the growth of electors in boroughs, and not generally since 1832; for when I stated what it had been from 1832 to 1865, I gave an unjust advantage to my opponents but since 1851. Now, I pray the House to observe these figures which I am about to give. In 1851 the total number of the electors in boroughs was 410,000; in 1865-6 it was 509,000, showing an increase of 99,000: that is to say, an increase of 24 per cent in fourteen years. That, then, has been the increase in the number of the electors. I come next to the increase of population in boroughs. In the year 146 1851 it was 7,186,000; in 1866 it was 9,266,000, giving an increase of 2,079,000, or, in other words, of 28*9 per cent in the population. That being so, I ask those Gentlemen who speak of the gradual absorption of the working classes into the constituencies and the franchise as being within their reach, to consider these figures. We now see that we have actually a slower growth of the electors in boroughs than of the population. Well, but while the population and the electors have been moving on as I have described, the wealth of the country among the middle and upper classes has, according to the best estimate which I can make, been advancing as follows: The income tax in 1851, making due allowance for the changes which have been since introduced into the law, may be taken with sufficient approach to accuracy, for the purpose of comparison, as having been worth PS850,000 per penny; this year I am enabled to state that it is worth PS1,400,000 per penny: that is to say, there has been an increase of 65 per cent in the wealth of the country liable to income tax, or at the rate of 4 per cent per annum. But when I tell you that this vast increase of wealth has been going on almost entirely in the upper and middle classes, and yet that the total number of electors in the towns does not keep pace with the population, I hope we shall hear no more of this supposed absorption of the working classes into the enfranchised body. I am justified, then, in stating that the working classes are not adequately represented in this House. They are not, it is admitted, represented in any proportion to their numbers; and without holding that it would be fit for us to do more than lessen the disproportion, we contend it is right to do as much. They are not represented, as I have previously shown, in accordance with their share of the income of the country. Especially after the events of the last few years, I may boldly proceed to say they are not represented in proportion to their intelligence, their virtue, or their loyalty. Finally, they are less represented now than they were thirty-six years ago, when they were less competent to exercise the franchise. A greater amount of representation with a less amount of fitness was not found to be injurious, but wholesome, for the State; and now, when, as you admit, there is a greater amount of fitness, and, as you must grant, a less amount of representation, you are not disposed to accede to a further measure of enfranchise-  147 ment. If these are not good reasons for extending the suffrage at the present, I know not what reasons can be good. But if hon. Members think they can hold their ground in a policy of resistance and refusal for the present, I have to ask them, how do they regard the future? My right hon. Friend the Member for Calne has prophesied to us, in the most emphatic terms, the ruin of the British Constitution. His prophecies were beautiful so far as his masterly use of the English language is concerned. But many prophecies quite as good may be found in the pages of Mr. Burke and Mr. Canning, and other almost equally distinguished men. What has been the fate of those prophecies? What use do they now serve? They form admirable material of declamations for schoolboys, and capital exercises to be translated into Greek. The prophecies of my right hon. Friend, like those of even greater men than he, may some thirty years hence serve a similar purpose. They may, for the beauty and force of their language, be selected by teachers at colleges and schools as exercises for their pupils, and my right hon. Friend will have his reward, as others have had theirs, Ut pueris placeas et declamatio fias. My hon. Friend says we know nothing about the labouring classes. Is not one single word a sufficient reply? That word is Lancashire; Lancashire, associated with the sufferings of the last four years, so painful and bitter in themselves to contemplate, but so nobly and gloriously borne? The qualities then exhibited were the qualities not of select men here and there among a depraved multitude, but of the mass of a working community. The sufferings were sufferings of the mass. The heroism was heroism of the mass. For my own part, I cannot believe that the men who exhibited those qualities were only a sample of the people of England, and that the rest would have wholly failed in exhibiting the same great qualities had occasion arisen. I cannot see what argument could be found for some wise and temperate experiment of the extension of civil rights among such people, if the experience of the past few years does not sufficiently afford it. And now, Sir, let us for a moment consider the enormous and silent changes which have been going forward among the labouring population. May I use the words to hon. and right hon. Gentlemen once used by way of exhortation by Sir 148 Robert Peel to his opponents, ""elevate your vision?"" Let us try and raise our views above the fears, the suspicions, the jealousies, the reproaches, and the recriminations of this place and this occasion. Let us look onward to the time of our children and of our children's children. Let us know what preparation it behoves us should be made for that coming time. Is there or is there not, I ask, a steady movement of the labouring classes, and is or is not that movement a movement onwards, and upwards? I do not say that it falls beneath the eye, for, like all great processes, it is unobservable in detail, but as solid and undeniable as it is resistless in its essential character. It is like those movements of the crust of the earth which science tells us are even now going on in certain portions of the globe. The sailor courses over them in his vessel, and the traveller by land treads them without being conscious of these changes; but from day to day, from hour to hour, the heaving forces are at work, and after a season we discern from actual experience that things are not as they were. Has my right hon. Friend, in whom mistrust rises to its utmost height, ever really considered the astonishing phenomena connected with some portion of the conduct of the labouring classes, especially in the Lancashire distress? Has he considered what an amount of self-denial was exhibited by these men in respect to the American war? They knew that the source of their distress lay in the war; yet they never uttered or entertained the wish that any effort should be made to put an end to it, as they held it to be a war for justice, and for freedom. Could any man have believed that a conviction so still, so calm, so firm, so energetic, could have planted itself in the minds of a population without becoming a known patent fact throughout the whole country? But we knew nothing of it. And yet when the day of trial came we saw that noble sympathy on their part with the people of the North; that determination that, be their sufferings what they might, no word should proceed from them that would hurt a cause which they so firmly believed to be just. On one side there was a magnificent moral spectacle; on the other side was there not also a great lesson to us all, to teach us that in those little tutored, but yet reflective minds, by a process of quiet instillation, opinions and sentiments gradually form themselves of which we for a long time remain unaware,  149 but which, when at last they make their appearance, are found to be deep-rooted, mature, and ineradicable? And now, Sir, J ask my noble Friend how he proposes to administer the government of that singularly associated family of persons who adopt this Amendment? There ought to be some unity of purpose among those friends and associates who have linked themselves together on a question such as this; among those who design to overturn Governments, or to destroy Reform Bills. I will state a portion of the contradictions that are to be gathered out of this debate on one side only. My noble Friend says we ought to have referred this question to the Committee of Privy Council. But the right hon. Member for the University of Cambridge (Mr. Walpole) tells him, and tells him truly, that it would be totally useless; firstly, it would do no good, and secondly, it would be entirely unconstitutional. That is the first specimen I give. Next, my right hon. Friend (Mr. Walpole) says we ought to have introduced a measure of re-distribution; but the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Stroud and the hon. Member for Galway say they would have been content, the one to support our Franchise Bill, and both to entertain and discuss it, if we had said nothing about re-distribution. Again, my hon. Friend the Member for Wick says we ought to proceed with the two Bills pari passu, but my right hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge University says, and supports his -opinion with reasoning to show, that such a course of proceeding would only involve increased delay. The right hon. Member for Calne says that would remove none of his objections. The right hon. Member for Bucks, I think, says the same, and yet the hon. Member for Wick says that if only we will adopt his advice he will ensure for our obtaining every vote on the Liberal side of the House. The hon. and learned Member for Belfast says representation is founded on classes. My right hon. Friend (Mr. Walpole) says, ""No, it is not founded on classes, but on communities."" The hon. and learned Member for Belfast says fitness is not aground for enfranchisement; and the right hon. Baronet the Member for Herts says not merely that he would be satisfied, but with emphatic and expressive gesture that he would be delighted if every artizan who is fit for the franchise could be admitted to it. The noble Lord the Member for Galway (Lord Dunkellin) not only 150 declares his adhesion to Reform, but states that it is in the capacity of an ardent Reformer that he objects to our measure; while the right hon. and gallant General the Member for Huntingdon (General Peel) frames a catalogue of the mischief we have had to endure during the Reforming era, and seems to consider that we have had not only enough of Reform in Parliament, but even a little more than enough. The hon. Member for Cambridge says, I think very truly, that Parliament is pledged in this matter, not, of course, to do what they think wrong; nobody ever said anything so absurd; but what is meant is this that those pledges of Parliament are pledges which, if they are not observed, will cause discredit to Parliament and will tend to the disparagement of Parliamentary Government with the country. But while my right hon. Friend says that Parliament is pledged, the hon. Member for Dublin and the right hon. Member for Bucks have laboured to demonstrate that it is under no pledge whatever. Lastly, Sir, the noble Lord the Member for Haddingtonshire says he is an ardent friend of Reform. I will not contradict him that would not he good manners, neither will I cite against him the words of any other Gentleman. But I will cite his own words or opinions. I conceive that in his judgment a most untrue and injurious judgment as I think he has contradicted himself; because he avowedly and pointedly glories in Lord Palmerston as being a man whose life, if it had only been prolonged, would have effectually kept at bay any new Reform Bill. That Sir, which I have represented in these references, is the state of self-contradiction among this party, a party gathered together for a chance purpose, with no bond of cohesion and no declared principle, with no avowed intention meaning as I must repeat, one thing and saying another thing saying that which is comparatively small account not saying but suppressing the thing which the most important persons in it deeply feel, and which they would wish to say. Such is the state of things among our present opponents, such is their harmony of language, their unity of view, upon this the first and only occasion on which they have been able to co-operate. Sir, the hour has arrived when this protracted debate must come to an end. [Cheers.] I cannot resent the warmth with which that last expression of mine  151 has been re-echoed. My apologies to the House are sincere. I feel deeply indebted, not to Gentlemen sitting on this side of the House only, but also and not less to hon. Gentlemen opposite, for the patience with which they have heard me. But a very few words more, and I have done. May I speak briefly to hon. Gentlemen opposite, as some of them have addressed advice to Gentlemen on this side of the House. I would ask them, ""Will you not consider, before you embark in this new crusade, whether the results of those other crusades in which you have heretofore engaged have been so satisfactory to you as to encourage you to repeat the operation?"" Great battles you have fought, and fought them manfully. The battle of maintaining civil disabilities on account of religious belief, the battle of resisting the first Reform Act, the obstinate and long-continued battle of Protection, all these great battles have been fought by the great party that I see opposite; and, as to some portion of those conflicts I admit my own share of the responsibility. But I ask, again, have their results have their results towards yourselves been such as that you should be disposed to renew struggles such as these? Certainly those who compose the Liberal party here, at least in that capacity have no reason or title to find fault. The effect of your course has been to give them for five out of every six, or for six out of every seven years since the epoch of the Reform Act the conduct and management of public affairs. The effect has been to lower, to reduce, and contract your just influence in the country, and to abridge your legitimate share in the administration of the Government. It is good for the public interest that you should be strong; but if you are to be strong, you can only be so by showing, in addition to the kindness and the personal generosity which I am sure you feel towards the people, a public, a political trust and confidence in them. What I now say can hardly be said with an evil motive. I am conscious of no such sentiment towards any man or party. But, Sir, we are assailed; this Bill is in a state of crisis and of peril, and the Government along with it. We stand or fall with it, as has been declared by my noble Friend Lord Russell. We stand with it now; we may fall with it a short time hence. If we do so fall, we, or others in our places, shall rise with it hereafter. I shall not attempt to measure with precision the forces that are to be arrayed 152 against us in the coming issue. Perhaps the great division of to-night is not the last that must take place in the struggle. At some point of the contest you may possibly succeed. You may drive us from our seats. You may bury the Bill that we have introduced, but we will write upon its gravestone for an epitaph this line, with certain confidence in its fulfilment  ""Exoriare aliquis nostris ex ossibus ultor."" You cannot fight against the future. Time is on our side. The great social forces which move onwards in their might and majesty, and which the tumult of our debates does not for a moment impede or disturb those great social forces are against you; they are marshalled on our side; and the banner which we now carry in this fight, though perhaps at some moment it may droop over our sinking heads, yet it soon again will float in the eye of heaven, and it will be borne by the firm hands of the united people of the three kingdoms, perhaps not to an easy, but to a certain and to a not distant victory."	229.0	1866.0	1860	[('well', 'well', ['positive',

376503	376503	S3V0214P0-02164	1873-02-13	UNIVERSITY EDUCATION (IRELAND).	MR. GLADSTONE,		"MR. GLADSTONE, in rising to move that the Chairman be directed to move the House, that leave be given to bring in a Bill for the extension of University Education in Ireland, said*: Mr. Bonham-Carter, I rise, Sir, for the third time since the formation of the present Government, to submit to the House in detail proposals respecting Irish affairs, in regard to which I say little in stating that they are vital to the honour and existence of the Government; but of which I may say also that which is of greater importance that they are vital to the prosperity and welfare of Ireland. For even if we think that University education is a matter less directly connected with the peace and happiness of the country than others on which we have formerly been called upon more than once to proceed, it must be borne in mind that when we look into the far future the well-being of Ireland must in a great degree depend on the moral and intellectual culture of her people; and that in the promotion of that culture the efficiency of her Universities cannot fail to be a most powerful and effectual instrument. There are, indeed, those who think, and those who say, that Ireland is a barren field on which to spend the efforts of Parliament, and that the more we endeavour to improve its condition the less return is made for our philanthropic labours. In that discouraging opinion the Government, however, do not concur. The state of Ireland at the present moment does not deter us from asking Parliament steadily to prosecute that course on which it has long ago entered. I will not, when I have so much of necessary exposition before me, trouble the House with details on a subject that is only germane to the matter immediately in hand and that does not strictly belong to its essence; but I may say, with respect to the condition of Ireland, that industry is flourishing, and that according to all appearances all well-known and ordinary appearances the best description of wealth in that country, the wealth of the community at large, rapidly increases; that order is respected, that ordinary crime is less than in England; that agrarian crime has greatly diminished; and, as it has  379 often been observed, and observed with truth, that when agrarian crime diminishes in Ireland, for the most part political and treasonable crime increases, I may state with thankful satisfaction that in 1871 treasonable offences in Ireland had sunk to the low number of seven only, and that in 1872 there was not one treasonable offence. I must again, as on former occasions, ask for the indulgence of the House, for I have to enter on a subject of great difficulty, great intricacy, and great complexity of detail; and it is only by means of that indulgence that I can hope in any degree to succeed in conveying to the mind of the House a clear conception either of the subject itself or of the intentions and proposals of the Government. There is another plea which, if it were needed, I would offer, but which I know is hardly needed namely, the plea for that favourable and candid consideration which in 1869 and 1870 we so largely experienced; which enabled us at those epochs to encounter the difficulties we had then to meet, and which, I believe, will now again be granted, and will again enable us to encounter the difficulties with which we now have to deal. There is, Sir, a subject of great importance, collateral to that immediately in hand, to which I will only refer for the sake of putting it aside; it is that which relates to the intermediate or proprietary schools in Ireland. It has lately been represented to me, with a singular and gratifying concurrence of opinion, from every quarter representing influence and intelligence in a particular county in Ireland I mean the county of Limerick that the greatest necessity exists for legislation with regard to the higher or preparatory schools of that country. I am quite sensible that is the case; but I am equally convinced that it is impossible for us advantageously to endeavour to mix legislation for the intermediate schools of Ireland with legislation in regard to her Universities. What I wish for the present to state is, our free admission that legislation with regard to its higher or preparatory schools, or, at least, the question how far it may be possible to legislate with regard to its schools, must arise as a necessary consequence of the legislation which Parliament may think fit to adopt with respect to the question of University education. I wish further to point 380 out that the course which Parliament may take, and the principles which it may adopt for its own guidance, with respect to University education will be of the utmost advantage to any Government that may have to frame a measure with regard to the higher or preparatory schools of Ireland. Admitting, therefore, the importance, and even the urgency, of the subject, I trust I shall be favourably understood when I say that we think it absolutely necessary to keep it apart from the intricate and difficult question of University education with which we have at present to deal. In approaching, Sir, the consideration of this question, it is impossible altogether to put out of view the flow of criticism with respect to the subject itself, and with respect to the intentions and conduct of the Government, which have for some time been almost incessantly brought under the public eye. We have heard much, Sir, of Ultramontane influence [""Hear, hear!""] and it may be well, therefore that cheer is an additional reason why I should notice the point to refer to it for a moment. I cannot wonder that apprehensions with respect to Ultramontane influence should enter into the minds of the British public whenever legislation affecting the position of the Roman Catholics in Ireland is projected; and we cannot, I think, be surprised that the influences which appear so forcibly to prevail within the Roman communion should be regarded by a very great portion of the people of this country with aversion, and by some portion of them even with unnecessary dread. It appears to us, however, that we have one course, and one course only to take, one decision, and one only to arrive at, with respect to our Roman Catholic fellow-subjects. Do we intend, or do we not intend, to extend to them the full benefit of civil equality on a footing exactly the same as that on which it is granted to members of other religious persuasions? If we do not, the conclusion is a most grave one; but if the House be of opinion, as the Government are of opinion, that it is neither generous nor politic, whatever we may think of this ecclesiastical influence within the Roman Church, to draw distinctions in matters purely civil adverse to our Roman Catholic fellowcountrymen if we hold that opinion, let us hold it frankly and boldly; and,  381 having determined to grant measures of equality as far as it may be in our power to do so, do not lot us attempt to stint our action in that sense when we come to the execution of that which we have announced to be our design. But there really, as I shall explain, is no room for any suspicion of either Ultramontane or any other influence with respect to the measure which I am now about to submit to the House. The truth is that circumstances entirely independent of our own will have precluded us from holding communications with any of the large bodies which may be said, as bodies, to be interested in Irish University education. The Governing Body of Trinity College, Dublin, have thought fit, in the exercise of their discretion a discretion which they had a perfect right to exercise to adopt a policy and to propose a plan of their own, or, at least, to associate themselves with the plan which was proposed in this Rouse by the hon. Member for Brighton, with the direct concurrence and sanction of one, perhaps of both, of the Members of the Dublin University. That being so, it is obvious that it would not have been consistent with the respect which we owe to that learned body that we should have attempted to induce it by private persuasion to accept a plan of a different character, or that we should have entered into communications with it as to the nature of the proposal which we are about to lay before the House. Under these circumstances, the principles of equal dealing prevented us from similar proceedings in any other quarter. Therefore, the door was shut in that direction by no act of ours, but by an act altogether independent of ourselves; and consequently it was plain that the best course for us to take was to look as well as we could to the general justice and equity of the course we felt ourselves called upon to pursue, to devise a plan founded upon our own matured convictions, to spare no labour in drawing up the details of that plan, and to forego altogether the advantage an advantage often considerable of holding communications beforehand with the various parties who wore interested in the matter. Therefore, the measure I am about to submit to the House is a measure solely of the Government. It is a measure of the Government alone; our responsibility for which is undivided, and 382 our hopes of the acceptance of which are founded entirely upon what we trust will be found to be its equity and its justice. The provisions of the Bill have been drawn up without any disposition to shape them for the purpose of currying favour or of conciliating any irrational prejudice, or of enabling the Government to pursue any other course than that which the most enlightened patriotism and the objects we have in view must dictate to every honourable mind. I think it will be for the convenience of the Committee if I endeavour, in the first place, as briefly as possible, to put aside a variety of alternative plans with regard to which numerous critics, who apparently know a great deal more about our own intentions and desires than we do ourselves, have from time to time assured the public that the Government have determined to adopt. Not satisfied with a single revelation, these well-informed intelligencers, for fear the interest of their readers in the subject should flag, have perhaps in the following week informed them that ""the Government had deviated from the plan they announced last week, and have adopted another plan,"" the provisions of which they again proceed to announce. Thus a lively interest in the question has been kept up. It was once said by an old poet that it was pleasant to stand on the seashore and to observe the mariner labouring on the sea, and it is often a source of amusement to public men engaged in preparing a measure of public importance to observe the floundering announcements with regard to it which from time to time are made by those who neither do nor can know anything about it. The first of these suggested plans to which I need refer is that which is founded on denominational endowment. I need only say, with regard to this plan, that Her Majesty's Government were precluded from adopting any scheme which involves denominational endowment by more than one conclusive objection. Denominational endowment, whether applied to a University or to a College in Ireland, would be in opposition to the uniform and explicit declarations which have been made, ever since this question assumed a new position six or seven years ago, by, I believe, every Member of the Government, and, as I can safely assert, by myself. But it is not only the fact that denominational  383 endowment is so contrary to our pledges that if it is to be adopted at all it must be by some other Administration than ourselves. Such pledges are, of course, in themselves conclusive; but there are other reasons which would compel us to refuse consideration to it, even if we were not bound by them. Were we free in the matter; and were the national convictions upon the subject less strong than I believe them to be, I confess I should think that the plan of denominational endowment in the circumstances in which Ireland is placed would be one unwise in principle to adopt. I doubt whether it would be favourable to the true interests of academical learning. I likewise doubt whether it would not lead the Government into hopeless confusion by entailing upon it the performance of an impossible task. The immediate result of such a plan would be an interference of the State with the management of institutions now entirely free, and an attempt, for which the State would be quite unfit, to adjust as between different classes the balance of power within them. If we are to give the money of the public to institutions founded by particular religious persuasions for the advancement of their own views by means of academical education, we must take precautions with respect to the use of that money, and it would be a, gross folly on the part of Parliament and of the Government were they to undertake to hold the balance between rival powers with the mutual relations of which they have nothing to do. Next, Sir, there was the plan which was adopted in 1866 by the Government of that day, which included many of my present Colleagues. This measure was founded upon the belief that the wants of Ireland with regard to University education might, in a great degree, be met by extending the basis of the Queen's University so far as to admit of extending the examination for degrees within its precincts to students from other Colleges, of whatever religious denomination they might be, or of students who belonged to no College at all. But that plan has entirely broken down. In the first place, the reception it met with at the time was not such as to give us any encouragement to proceed with it; and, in the second place, a proposal that may have been equal to the circumstances of 1866 is not equal to those of 1873. The 384 circumstances of Ireland have changed since 1866 with regard to this matter of public instruction, and therefore any idea of proposing a scheme of that nature has not been entertained by Her Majesty's Government for a single instant. Another plan which has suggested itself to many minds is that of establishing a new University in Ireland by the side of the Dublin University and by the side of the Queen's University, which is also an University placed by its charter in the City of Dublin. Certainly, such a plan had one recommendation in its favour namely, that it would present to us the novelty of the existence of three Universities in one city. I doubt very much whether, in any period of the history of the world, or, at any rate, whether at this moment anywhere in Europe, such a singular arrangement is to be found as would result from the. adoption of such a plan; and I also doubt whether we should act for the advantage of academical education were it to be adopted merely for the purposes of political expediency that is to say, for the relief of the Government and of Parliament in a moment of difficulty. Under these circumstances, this is not a proposal that I could undertake to recommend to the House of Commons for their acceptance. I must further add with reference to this proposition that the three Universities to be established under it would scarcely have a fair start. The present University of Dublin, sustained by enormous property and powerful traditions; the Queen's University, with its means comparatively limited, and its constitution much more narrow; and the third University, hobbling and lagging behind the second as much as the second would behind the first could scarcely be said to stand upon a footing conformable to justice. That would not be a state of things that would be regarded by any of us with great satisfaction, and would not be a course of proceeding by which we could hope to effect a real settlement of this great question. A few minutes ago, Sir, we heard read from the Table of the House that paragraph of Her Majesty's Speech in which reference was made to University Education in Ireland; it is a paragraph in so far significant that it draws a broad and clear distinction between the two portions of this subject, which distinction  385 we have kept in view all along. The second of them relates to the rights of conscience. And the rights of conscience are, as we think, deeply concerned in this question, because we hold that there has long been a religious grievance in Ireland, arising out of the existing state and law of University education, and that it is our duty, in offering any proposal to Parliament as a settlement of this question, to make provision for the complete removal of all religious grievances. But, at the same time, it would be a great mistake to suppose that the religious grievance constitutes either the whole or the main question before us. It certainly forms an essential part of it as a negative condition, but the positive and substantive part is that which relates to the promotion of academical learning in Ireland. These two matters I shall endeavour to keep separately in view while I address the House on this subject, as they have all along been kept separately in view by the Government. I am by no means prepared to state that there is no likelihood of conflict between these two principles. It is perfectly plain that the old academical learning, which included teaching in all subjects, must be modified; because where there is a difference of religious convictions to be provided for, it is impossible to retain the perfectness and completeness which academical learning possessed in the olden time. A large number of Her Majesty's subjects are at this moment debarred from University training because they send their children to places of education where their religion is taught by authority, as part of the training in those institutions. Now, it may be said that, even though this may be true, two questions are to be raised first, is the allegation true; and, secondly, if it is true, are the persons who thus withhold their children from University training right or are they wrong? Let me observe, in the first instance, that the question is not whether we agree with them or no. Parliament has advisedly determined to give the preference to academical institutions which are not denominational. This, in the three kingdoms, is the Imperial policy, and to it, in all instances, we shall adhere. But there is more to say. When it was observed in former times that the great majority of the people of Ireland were Roman Catholics, it was answered, ""So 386 much the worse for them; let them adopt the true religion, and then all difficulties will disappear."" But Parliament came to the conclusion that it was its duty to recognise the fact and to accept the consequences. There are many Presbyterians who desire to be educated in a College where their own religion is taught; and the existence at this moment of Magee College, under a most able Principal who, I believe, enjoys very high repute in the Presbyterian body, notwithstanding all its difficulties by reason of exclusion from University training, affords a proof that this belief, that education should be given in connection with denominational teaching, is not confined to the Roman Catholic communion. I have said it is not our business to inquire whether the Roman Catholics are right in their opinion, or whether they are wrong. The question for us is rather this supposing they are wrong, is it right in us, or is it wise, that they should be excluded from University training? For that is the course which, up to this moment, has been pursued. I do not think that Englishmen, who are accustomed to send their own sons for the most part to these institutions where they are trained in their religion by the same authority that communicates to them the other parts of education, can very severely condemn this error of the Roman Catholics of Ireland, and of some of the Presbyterians of Ireland, if error it is proved to be. Now, I will look at the question in a very simple form. What is the state of the case as to the actual enjoyment of University training by the Roman Catholics of Ireland? I shall not enter into those details of controversy which have been handled with great ability by Gentlemen on one side and the other. There are those who think, and who are bold enough to maintain, that upon the whole, considering who Roman Catholics are, considering how little property they possess, how little it is possible for them to enter upon the higher culture, their state, so far as University education is concerned, is not very bad at this moment. I hold, on the contrary, that it is miserably bad. I go farther; and I would almost say, it is scandalously bad. I will go into figures, which will at least bring to a test the proposition that I have laid down; but, in applying those  387 figures, I will first protest against the manner in which the subject has hitherto been handled, and will call the attention of the Committee to a distinction which it appears to me they ought to bear in mind in order that they may estimate correctly the facts. In the Queen's Colleges, Ireland, the total number of matriculated students is returned to me as 708. The number of Roman Catholics among them is 181, or somewhat over one-fourth. But my proposition is this: In the Return there is a fundamental fallacy; the great bulk of these matriculated students, or, at least, a very large portion of them, are simply professional students, and are not students in Arts. But when we speak of University education as an instrument of the higher culture, we mean University education in Arts. Schools of law, schools of medicine, schools of engineering, and I know not how many other schools, are excellent things; but these are things totally distinct and different from what we understand by that University training which we look upon as the most powerful instrument for the formation of the mind. Therefore I am obliged to break down these figures into fragments, and to ask, out of these 181 students, how many are students in Arts? I now give the Roman Catholic students in Arts in the Queen's Colleges of Ireland. From 1859 to 1864, in the three Queen's Colleges, the Roman Catholic students in Arts averaged 59; from 1864 to 1869 they averaged 50; from 1869 to 1871 they averaged 45. I think these figures justify the statement that the numbers are miserably small; and that, small as they are, they are, moreover, dwindling away. And, Sir, when I speak of recognizing only students in Arts, I am not hazarding the opinion of an individual; I am giving utterance to a judgment which I know every University man will sustain. It is the opinion upon which the University of Dublin has uniformly proceeded in its handling of this subject. The number of Roman Catholics matriculated as students in Arts at Trinity College seems to be about 100. That may not be the exact number, but, from the figures kindly supplied to me, it must be within two or three, one way or the other. Adding these 100 at Trinity College to 45 at the Queen's Colleges we have 145 as the whole number of persons whom 4,000,000 and upwards of Roman 388 Catholics in Ireland at present succeed in bringing within the teaching of a University to receive academical training in the faculty of Arts. Well, I think that is a proportion miserably small. It is something, but it is really almost next to nothing. Again, Sir, the total number of students in Arts in Ireland I find to be 1,179. So that the Roman Catholics, with more than two-thirds I think nearly three-fourths of the population supply only an eighth part of the students in Arts. I think there are hardly any in this House who will think fit to say that that is anything like an adequate proportion anything like the numbers which they ought to furnish, even after making every allowance which ought fairly to be made for the relative proportions of Roman Catholics in the different classes of the community. Well, I think, then, I have shown that there is a great religious grievance in Ireland. Had I been able to point to a state of things in which the movement was in the other direction in which, instead of an almost constant decrease of Roman Catholic attendance at the Queen's Colleges, there was a steady, healthy, and progressive increase the case would have been greatly different. You might have said, ""It is well to wait and see what happens."" But I am afraid if we wait to see what happens, the only result of that would be to aggravate a state of things already sufficiently bad. I now, Sir, quit the topic of the religious grievance. But quite apart from the religious grievance, there is a great and strong necessity for academical reform in Ireland. I will test the question first as to the quantity or supply of academical training in that country; and all along I will keep broadly and plainly in view the distinction between training in Arts and mere professional training. Now, in Trinity College there are attending lectures in Arts 563 young men, about the same number I think it is a little more as attend in Trinity College, Cambridge. In the Queen's Colleges the students in Arts are as follow I take the year 1871, which is the latest I possess: At Belfast, 136; at Cork, 50; and at Galway, 35 in all 221. Adding these two figures together we get 784 as the total for Ireland of University students in the proper sense of the word; that is to say, in the sense in which it is understood in Scotland,  389 much more in the sense in which it is understood in England. 784 is the whole number of students who are receiving regular instruction in. Arts, for the whole of Ireland, with its five and a half millions of population. But there are a large number of students in the Queen's Colleges who are receiving professional education in law, in medicine, and in engineering. The number of these is at Belfast 201, at Cork 174, and at Galway 80 in all 455. Thus, when we include students preparing for a professional career with the Arts students, we come up to 1,239. Finally, there are a large number of persons who belong to Trinity College, Dublin, who have the honour of paying, without any deduction, all the fees of Trinity College, Dublin, but who receive from Trinity College, Dublin, no other benefits and great benefits they are shown to be, or the price would not be paid for them than those of examination and a degree. The number of these is 395, so that in this way we get up the number of University students in Ireland to the very poor and scanty figure of 1,634, of whom less than one-half are University students in the English or in the Scottish sense of the word. In students in that sense in Ireland there are but 784, against 4,000 whom Scotland, with not much more than half the population, sends to her Universities. I think that is a pretty strong case as regards the absolute supply of University and academic training in Ireland. But the case is stronger still when we consider the comparative state of the academical supply. Take the Queen's Colleges, those valuable institutions which we should heartily desire to see in a flourishing condition. From 1859 to 1864 they matriculated on the average 226 persons per annum. This is in Arts and other faculties taken together. From 1864 to 1869 they matriculated 1,039 persons, or an average of 208 persons. In each of the years 1870-71 they matriculated 200 persons. Thus, as far as the Queen's Colleges are concerned, even the present narrow supply of academic training is a supply tending downwards. What is the case as regards Trinity College? Having a strong sentiment of veneration and gratitude for that institution, which has done in Ireland a large portion of the good which has been done for her at all, I observe with the greatest 390 regret the decline in the number of students there. I now draw no distinction between resident and non-resident students; and I find that during the period of years from 1830 to 1834 the annual matriculations were 433. Then, taking a period of 15 years down to 1849, at the end of which the Queen's Colleges were founded, the matriculations had sunk to 362 per annum; while from 1849 to 1872 they had again sunk to 295. Thus, Sir, we find, upon examining this matter to the bottom, that notwithstanding the efforts of Parliament, notwithstanding the general increase of education, notwithstanding the opening of the Queen's Colleges with large endowments, the University students of Ireland in the proper sense that is, the students in Arts are fewer at this moment than they were 40 years ago, when no Queen's Colleges were in existence. I have shown you that, at this moment, the students in Arts in Ireland, even including men who are merely examined and who do not attend lectures, only number 1,179; but I find that in 1832 the students in Arts at Trinity College alone were 1,461. Sir, I think I have now sufficiently made good my case as to the supply of academic training in Ireland and the necessity of reform so far as such a necessity can be deduced from the mere paucity of supply. And here I pause for one moment to rebut the charge that this state of things, though it would not do for Scotland or for England, will do for Ireland. It is not true that Ireland is indifferent to culture. Irishmen have their vices as well as their virtues, like every other people on the face of the earth; but among their virtues has been an appetite for culture, abiding and struggling for the opportunity to act even under all the difficulties and all the disadvantages of their position. Look at the College of Maynooth. Some people will tell me that at Maynooth there is no culture at all. Now, I will not enter into that debate; but it surely must be admitted, even by the most hostile, that, if not culture in the broadest sense, it is at all events relative culture. Allowing for differences of religion, the Maynooth student is raised by the training he receives in that College far above his original level, and is so raised by a course of culture; and everyone who  391 has the happiness of knowing the accomplished gentleman who presides over the College will know that such a man would not be found at the head of an institution where the spirit of culture was not encouraged. What is the case at Maynooth? Quoting from a pamphlet by a Roman Catholic gentleman who enjoys one-half the name of my hon. Friend (Dr. Lyon Playfair), and who possesses, I think, not less than one-half his ability also, I find that during the three years 1866-69 the average number of entrances was 90 per annum. Since that time, the income of Maynooth has been cut down to perhaps little more than a moiety by the arrangements of of 1869, though it receives a considerable income still; but the entrances, instead of going down, have risen from 90 to an annual average of 105; and Dr. Lyons distinctly states that, over and above any advantages that the Maynooth students derive from the College, it costs each of them on an average PS50 a year to go to Maynooth, the great bulk of these students being, as he says, the sons of the smaller farmers of the country. But the case does not rest upon a casual illustration from Maynooth. It is really an appealing to the whole history of Ireland that she may make a plea for herself, and refuse to be smitten with this condemnation of indifference to culture. Sir, there is a love of letters in Ireland. Ireland is not barbarous in mind. She can say justly on her own behalf  ""Nec sum adeo informis nuper me in litore vidi, Cum placidum ventis stabat mare."" If only we will give her a tranquil sea in which to mirror herself, it will be in fair visage that she will return to the view. Now, I am about to criticise the constitution of Trinity College and of Dublin University; and here I wish to draw a broad distinction. We have been told about forms of government that ""Whate'er is best administered is best;"" and I freely and gladly avow, in the case of Trinity College, Dublin, and the Dublin University, that one of the most astounding academic constitutions which it could ever have entered into the head of man to devise has, notwithstanding, through a liberal and enlightened administration, been made to produce great 392 benefits to the country. This constitution is in everything almost exactly the opposite of that which, according to admitted rules, it ought to be. The University of Dublin is in absolute servitude to the College of Dublin. But when, 20 years ago, we began to think about the reform of the English Universities, what was the first thing we endeavoured to do? We endeavoured to emancipate the University from the exclusive sway of the Colleges; and that we did in Cambridge, where there were 17 Colleges and Halls, and in Oxford, where there were 24 this immense diversity producing, of necessity, a great variety and play of influences. But here we have the case of a single University, with a single College, and the University is in absolute servitude to the College. When I say, ""in servitude to the College,"" what does that mean? The College is a large and illustrious body. Does it mean in servitude to the whole assembly of the College? Certainly not. It means eight gentlemen who elect the other Fellows, who elect also themselves, and who govern both the University and the College. That is the state of things which we find in the University of Dublin and in Trinity College. The Provost and seven Fellows are the persons who appoint, to begin with, the Chancellor of the University. He is not elected, as in Oxford and Cambridge, and, I think, in some or all of the Scotch Universities; nor is he appointed by the Crown. He is appointed by the Provost and seven Fellows. But, when he is appointed, what can he do? What is there the Chancellor of the University of Dublin can do except by the command or with the assent of the Provost and seven Fellows? As I understand, one of the great functions of the Chancellor of the University is to convoke the Senate of the University; but at Dublin he cannot do this except upon the requisition of the Provost and seven Fellows. And when the Senate is convoked, the Provost and the seven Fellows, or the Provost alone, have the power at any moment by absolute veto to stop any of its proceedings. Now that is the position of the University of Dublin in reference to Trinity College. No degree, again, can be granted by the University of Dublin unless it receives a proposal to that effect from the College; that is, from the Pro-  393 vost and the seven Fellows. On the other hand, when it has received this permission, it cannot refuse to grant the degree, unless it votes in the negative three times over, when the matter stands for further consideration at the next meeting of the Senate. Well, Sir, these things are singular. They are hardly credible. And now, to crown it all, let me give you the truly Irish consummation. [A laugh.] I beg pardon for having used that phrase, but, as I hope to be well-mannered in general towards Ireland, I may be forgiven that single offence. It is, then, a fact that the Senate of the University of Dublin was formally incorporated by letters patent in 1857; and it has been acting, as has been always supposed, upon the strength of those letters patent ever since. They have been referred separately to two of the ablest lawyers in Ireland Sir Abraham Brewster, the ex-Lord Chancellor, and Baron Fitzgerald; and both of those eminent lawyers entertained the gravest doubts whether or rather I should say they evidently are of opinion that the letters patent are invalid, and not worth the paper on which they are written. This, Sir, is a singular state of things with respect to the constitution of the University, and, certainly, the stranger it is, the more credit is due to those who have administered its affairs in its relation to the College; but even this is not all. I have heard the hon. and learned Gentleman the junior Member for the University of Dublin, in language with which I strongly sympathised, pleading far academic freedom against political party, and against the interference of the State and Crown. But how does Trinity College itself stand with regard to such interference? Why, Sir, as the University of Dublin is absolutely dependent upon the College, the whole supreme power of legislation for the College lies with the Crown. It can override the Provost and seven Fellows to any extent it pleases. And I will now make a premature revelation for the satisfaction of the hon. and learned Gentleman as to what we are going to propose. I hope we shall be able to propose, on behalf of Trinity College, a somewhat more independent constitution than that which it now possesses. Well, Sir, I think I have shown that, if there be anything sound in the principle for which I am contending, and the absolute 394 necessity of which has been, as a general rule, admitted namely, the principle of setting the University free from the exclusive dominion of the College, I think I have shown that the present state of the constitution of the University of Dublin calls for interference although I grant that to some extent you may make for it the same sort of argument that in 1830 and 1831 was made for the old Parliamentary Constitution namely, that, whatever may be said about it in the abstract, the fruits of it on the whole have been greatly better than could have been expected. And now, Sir, while I promise not to deviate from the path which is traced out for me by the subject, I am sorry to be compelled from the necessity of the case to dwell for a while upon the University of Dublin; upon the question what it is legally, morally, and historically, and what it ought to be. And, first of all, I desire to clear away a degree of confusion that exists in the minds of some respecting the relative position of the University of Dublin and Trinity College. To this confusion I am afraid our friends in Scotland have made a liberal contribution, because in Scotland the University and the College are for every practical purpose the same thing. According to the old Roman law, as I am informed, universitas and collegium were as nearly as possible synonymous. I have not lived much in Scotland for nearly 20 years, but when I did live there it was a common thing to hear a Scotchman say to a friend"" Have you sent your son yet to Oxford College? ""The University and the College were to him exactly one and the same in idea and in fact. What I want is to sever these words effectually one from the other; and I beg the Committee to believe, what I will distinctly show, that in the case of the University of Dublin and Trinity College they are in law and in history entirely distinct and separate bodies. It is not very easy, perhaps, to supply an analogy to illustrate their actual connection; but the nearest one I know belongs to the beginning of the 17th century. It is in the famous theory of Hooker, who held that every man in England was a member of the State, and also a member of the Church; although it was admitted they were two different forms of society, yet they presented only two different  395 aspects of the body politic. In the same way we have had the University and the College of Dublin co-extensive as to the persons of whom they are composed. Nevertheless their academical and legal character has been perfectly distinct. The University exists apart from the College now, as it has all along existed, morally and legally apart, notwithstanding the fact of the identity of the persons of whom the two are composed. Let me try if I can prove the proposition I have stated. And, first, I will point out the separate existence of the University, because this is the basis of the measure which the Government is going to propose. It is shown, even at the present day, by the existence of the Senate. The Senate is not the Senate of the College; it is the great assembly of the University. Whether the letters patent of 1857 be valid or not is immaterial. The Senate existed before the letters patent, and would exist without them; but besides the Senate, the University of Dublin has other elements of a constitution perfectly distinct from that of the College. The Senate has the exclusive right to grant degrees, although it does so, I must admit, in durance vile, and under great compulsion; but the College has no power to grant degrees, they are given exclusively by the University. The University has a Chancellor and a Vice Chancellor, and, lastly, the University has and this is very important Parliamentary representation. That representation is not a representation of the College; and here is the single case in which the two societies consist of different persons. Many of those who have taken their names off the books of the College continue to vote for Members to represent the University in this House, and they are compelled, in order to qualify for that purpose, to retain their names only on the books of the University. The University of Dublin does not, as some may suppose, originally date from the reign of Elizabeth. So far back as the year 1311, at a period when a great intellectual movement occurred in Europe, the Archbishop of Dublin, John Lech, obtained a Bull from Pope Clement V. to found an University (Universitas scholarum) in that city. Another Archbishop of Dublin, Archbishop Alexander de Bichnor, obtained a code of statutes for the University. In 1358, Edward III. founded a 396 Lectureship in Theology in the University; and here we encounter a singularly interesting circumstance, for Edward III. provided in that foundation that, for the purpose of their attending the lectures in theology, safe-conducts should be granted for the resort of students from all parts of Ireland, and these safe-conducts should be granted not only to the English of the Pale, but also to the Irish enemy, as ho was commonly called, from beyond it. It is really touching to see this sign of brotherhood and of the common tie of humanity betraying itself in connection with the foundation of the University, and in the form of a regulation for securing free access to its benefits. In 1364 the Duke of Clarence founded a Preachership and Lectureship in St. Patrick's, which was the site of the old University before the Reformation. In 1465 it appears that the Parliament of Ireland had endeavoured to found a University which, I suspect, very few gentlemen here have heard of  namely, the University of Drogheda; and the failure of this endeavour led Pope Sixtus IV. to give authority for a like foundation in Dublin, inasmuch as  so says the Pope there was none at that time in the island, showing that the former foundations had been broken up. In 1496 another Archbishop of Dublin taxed his clergy in Provincial Synod to find stipends for seven years for the lecturers of the University; and from some evidence of the 16th century it is clear that teaching in some form or other did continue in connection with St. Patrick's Church until about the reign of Edward VI. It is of singular interest, I think, when we consider the rudeness of the times and the disorganized state of the country, to witness those continual efforts to introduce through an University the elements of humanity and civilization. Across that sanguinary scene of war and turbulence and bloodshed, flits from time to time this graceful vision of an University, appearing to-day, disappearing to-morrow, re-appearing on an after day  ""Par levibus ventis, volucrique simillima sonmo,"" but, unhappily, never able to root itself on a firm foundation in the soil, like the Universities of England, or like those of Scotland at a corresponding date. We have now, Sir, reached the reign of Elizabeth; and here we find that great man Sir Henry Sydney, the Lord Deputy,  397 whose fame has been, I think, unreasonably and unjustly obscured by the more brilliant but not more solid reputation of his son, petitioning the Queen, in 1568, for the revival of the University. In 1585 Sir John Parrott, who had then succeeded to the office of Lord Deputy, proposed to dissolve St. Patrick's Church, for the purpose of founding two Universities, but Archbishop Loftus objected to that proceeding as sacrilegious. Some critical observers put another and less favourable interpretation on the objection I do not know whether justly or not; but there is some allegation as to the granting of leases of portions of the property to blood relations. However, Archbishop Loftus afterwards himself proposed the plan which has ultimately expanded itself into the present University of Dublin. He obtained a grant of the Monastery of All Hallows, near Dublin, and he prevailed upon Queen Elizabeth to found a college in Dublin, which college was to be Mater Universitatis. It is important to know what was the meaning of that expression. I will give my own version of it, and with the more confidence, because something like it has been given already by one whom I look upon as the highest of all the authorities who have dealt with the curious history of the University of Dublin namely, the very learned Dr. Todd, so long and honourably connected with that University. For 150 or 200 years all efforts to found a University alone had been vain; again and again it had dissolved into thin air. In the reign of Queen Elizabeth a completely different policy was adopted, and instead of beginning with the University, it was determined to begin with the College. They, therefore, founded a College, and it was incorporated, but they did not incorporate the University, which, as a University, remains to this day unincorporated. I think that policy was a wise and sagacious one. The men of that time appear to have reasoned thus   ""Hitherto, the University has pined and died from want of the proper material to sustain it. We will supply the material which will feed the sacred flame; for it is not here as it was in England, where the University grew as it were spontaneously, in obedience to demand, to supply a thirst for learning. If we plant firmly a nucleus of teachers and scholars, around it will gather a 398 body of men, out of which a real and solid University will hereafter grow."" They therefore planted their College and called it Mater Universitatis, meaning thereby that from the College a University was to spring up, and that other Colleges were to appear from time to time within its precincts. Now, Sir, it may appear to some that I am talking strangely when I speak thus; but I will make good, briefly and I think conclusively, that, according to the original design of the University of Dublin and as to the continued remembrance, and as to the maintenance of that design I will give you evidence for 200 years, from the date of Queen Elizabeth's foundation there were to be and there ought to be other Colleges in the University of Dublin. In 1600, the College having only begun to take students in 1593, the first ""commencement,"" as it was termed, was held, showing that the University was in action as distinct from the College, and this at the close of the first period, when a course of study had been completed by the very first pupils. In 1615, or some say a little earlier, the University statutes were published, and by them, with modifications, the University has been governed to this day. This was done by the College. It was to be a Mater Universitatis, and it was not unfaithful to its trust. Undoubtedly  and it is a large part of the case I have to state the original design has not been fulfilled; but I do not say it was the fault of the persons connected with the College. It was the fault and misfortune of the times, for not only were efforts made to found new Colleges in Dublin in the 17th century, but those efforts took some effect; and I find that no less than four Colleges and Halls are on record. One was founded as soon as 1604 only 11 years after the commencement of the practical operations of Trinity College   namely, Woodward's Hall. Trinity Hall was founded in 1617, and that, I think, is the one which took some root as a medical College, and subsisted down to about 1689. In 1630 New College was founded, and in the same year St. Stephen's or Kildare Hall. It is shown by these imperfect foundations, made at a time when the mother College was itself still immaturely established, that those who followed the founders of 1593 were anxious to give effect to their design of multiplying Col-  399 leges around Trinity College, which should share in the enjoyment of the same privileges; and thereby to bring into existence the true idea of a University, as it had been understood, and as it already existed in England, which was the model they had before their eyes. But this, Sir, is not all. I will show further that the most solemn and important public documents have again and again referred to the intention of founding new Colleges in the University. In 1613 James I. gave the University of Dublin the right of being represented by two Members in the Irish Parliament, and in giving it, after mentioning Trinity College, he speaks of ""aliorum collegiorum sive aularum in dicta Universitate in posterum erigendarum ac stabiliendarum."" In his view, therefore, other Colleges were to be founded in Dublin. In 1662 the Act of Settlement empowered the Lord Lieutenant to erect another College, to be of the University of Dublin, to be called King's College, and to be endowed with any amount of property from the forfeited estates not ex-exceeding the then very large sum of PS2,000 a-year. The last, and perhaps the most curious, indication I will give is of the date of 1793. The disabilities which excluded Roman Catholics from Trinity College and the University of Dublin were then removed by law; and an Act was passed which, while it provided that they might enter Trinity College, but not share in the endowments of the College, further provided that ""Papists might take degrees, Fellowships, or Professorships in any College to be hereafter founded under that Act,"" subject to the double condition that such College was not to be founded for the education of Papists alone, excluding all other persons, and that it was to be a member of the University of Dublin. I think, then, I have shown with regard to that University that, according to the spirit and intent of its foundation, it is a scheme which, noble in itself, remains unfulfilled, and, consequently, presents the strange anomalies in its constitution to which I have referred. I wish to quote, in a few words, the legal opinion of Baron Fitzgerald, given, I think, in 1858, with regard to the scope of Dublin University, and to the question how far it is conformable to its plan that it should include other Colleges with Trinity College. It is not for me, speaking among 400 many eminent lawyers, to draw a distinction among members of the Irish Bar, but as far as I can judge from what I have heard of the opinions and writings of Baron Fitzgerald on this subject, he certainly carries in my eye the appearance of a man of very considerable weight, ability and authority in his profession. After reasoning upon other matters, he says  ""The consequences of this would of course be that by the mere creation of any other College in the University, each and every student (studiosus) admitted to it, whether belonging to that new College or corporation or not, would become entitled to the University privileges."" I think I have now sufficiently indicated the historical ground upon which we feel that in dealing with this intricate and most important question it is much better to go to the root of the matter, to deal with it thoroughly, and to propound to Parliament a plan which, from its comprehensiveness and solidity, might afford promise of giving peace and of offering finality in that limited but reasonable sense in which alone it is applicable to human affairs; and I propound with some confidence to the House that the University of Dublin, as distinct from Trinity College, is the ancient, historic, national University of the country, that its constitution is in a state of the strangest anomalies, that it calls for reform, and that it is this University within the precincts of which the reform now projected for Ireland ought to take effect. This seems to be the point in the course of my statement at which I ought to refer to the Queen's Colleges and the Queen's University. We have looked carefully at the state of the Queen's Colleges, and we have arrived at the conclusion that the College of Belfast is strongly and solidly founded, and is eminently adapted to meet the wishes and wants of a large portion of the population in the North of Ireland. We also think that the College of Cork, although not perhaps so solidly founded as Belfast, although not at any rate invested with so large a promise of expansion under favourable circumstances, presents what may be called a very fair Parliamentary case, from the number of persons it trains, as well as the efficiency of that training. With regard to Galway College, we have arrived at a different conclusion. I am now speaking, remem-  401 ber, of matter which is not of the essence of the plan of the Government. The essence of the plan lies in what relates to the University of Dublin and to Trinity College. The propositions I now make are collateral to the main portion of the plan, and may be dealt with apart from it, but from a sense of their merits we are disposed to urge them strongly on the House. Galway College, if it has not materially declined, cannot certainly be said to have advanced of late years. The whole number of matriculated students in 1870-71, the Return for which is now, I believe, laid on the Table, was only 117, of whom half were medical students; and I may observe that, however excellent professional schools may be, they are not institutions which have the largest claims on the taxpayers of this country. They are rather in the nature of self-supporting institutions. Education in Arts does not directly lead, as a general rule, to remuneration; but education in Medicine will, I hope, always prove its own reward; and the whole number of students in Arts in Galway, whom I point out as the more proper objects of a public foundation if public foundation there is to be is only about 30. However invidious it may be to look to pounds, shillings, and pence in these matters, and although there come from Galway a certain number of very well-instructed men, even the best article cannot be viewed without some regard to the price, and it is only right I should tell the House that the charge on the Consolidated Fund and other expenses of Galway College amount to PS10,000 a-year. I have called for an account of the charge to the Exchequer of every pupil in the College, and the Return given me is this: The cost per annum to the public of every pupil is 177; the cost of every pupil carried on to a degree in Arts is PS231, and the cost of every graduate in Law I confess I grudge this the most, for I know no class which can plead less in the way of necessity for public subvention than our respected friends the lawyers is PS308. The medical charge is lower. We get a doctor and in almost every case, I am happy to say, a very efficient doctor for PS154. Now, under these circumstances, we doubt and more than doubt, whether, when so much better arrangements are about to be made for the people of Ireland, so large a sum 402 of public money ought permanently to continue to be applied to the purposes of Galway College. We are disposed, therefore, to recommend, with every proper consideration for vested interests in the Galway College, that measures should be taken for winding-up within a reasonable time its transactions. The measure we propose is that the Council of the Queen's University, which will not certainly be adverse to the College, shall frame a scheme for winding-up its operations at some period before the 1st of January, 1876, a time which will allow everyone connected with the College ample time to finish his career. I pass on now to the Queen's University. The Queen's University and the Colleges, as a whole, have in my opinion rendered great service to Ireland, and if they have been prevented, as they have been prevented, from doing a great deal more good, it has been by an unhappy, if not even a strange combination of influences. I know not whether any one supposes me to be actuated by a sentiment of either open or latent hostility to the Queen's Colleges; but this I may say, that when many objected to them I spoke and voted as an independent Member of Parliament for their foundation in 1845, and have never ceased to wish them well. But now I wish to do an act of justice. It is quite true that the main cause of their comparative failure has lain in the operation of ecclesiastical influence from the Roman side. This influence, however, has been accepted, appropriated, and made their own by a very large portion of the members of the Roman Catholic Church. But what I wish to point out and it is only fair to point it out is this: The first blow, and it was a very serious blow, struck at the Queen's Colleges, was not struck from that quarter. There never was a plan, I believe, devised in a spirit of more tender regard for religion than the plan of the Queen's Colleges as it was framed by Sir Robert Peel and Sir James Graham; and those who will look back to the provisions of the Act which established the Colleges in 1845 will see the most distinct indications of their desire, on the one hand, to keep the State out of the vortex of polemical differences, and, on the other hand, to give the utmost possible facilities, to all who were so disposed, for making direct provision for instruction in  403 religion within the walls of appropriate buildings, and in immediate connection with the Colleges themselves. These provisions most unhappily proved abortive; but who was it that struck the first blow? On the very night when the Bill was introduced by Sir Robert Peel or Sir James Graham, my much lamented Friend Sir Robert Inglis, as Member for the University of Oxford, felt it incumbent on him in the discharge of his duty to rise in his place and denounce them as a ""gigantic scheme of Godless education."" And again, at the end of the debate on the second reading, so far from softening or withdrawing the language he had used, he felt it a matter of honour to repeat it and insist on it. After that declaration so made, it was perhaps not very easy for the representative of Orthodoxy in Rome to accept as sufficiently religious for Rome what the representative of Orthodoxy in Oxford had repudiated and condemned as not sufficiently religious for Oxford. I here speak of the Colleges as a whole, and it will be distinctly understood why with these views we think that the Belfast College and the Cork College should be maintained; although with respect to Galway College the case is different, and we are of opinion that, without the smallest imputation on the teachers in it, the heavy charge it imposes is not warranted by the results. I come now to the Queen's University. We regard its influence as unmixedly good, so far as it goes; but I doubt very much whether, if we succeed in reorganizing, opening, enlarging, and liberally endowing the University of Dublin, it would be for the interest of the Queen's University to maintain a separate existence by its side. Let me point out these considerations. In the first place, if, where there are only three Colleges, and where the professors of the Colleges form the whole staff of the University the University is not very strong, obviously it has nothing to spare take away one of the Colleges, and the University will be weaker than it was before. In the next place we must expect, as a matter of course, that these Colleges will have to suffer more or less from the competition of an enlarged and effective University of Dublin, and from the greater liberty which will now be secured, especially for Roman Catholics, in choosing the place of their education. In the third 404 place, if we leave it as it is, it will be excluded from those liberal endowments which we hope will be possessed and enjoyed by the University of Dublin. And, lastly, it will have no share in that great advantage the privilege of Parliamentary representation   which the University of Dublin enjoys, and which I hope that University will always enjoy. For these reasons, and not in any penal sense, not believing that the institution is not a beneficial institution, but with a view to the yet greater advantage of those who now profit by its existence, we are of opinion that it will be a wise course if Parliament should be disposed to say that the Queen's University, which was brought into existence merely to answer the purposes of the Colleges, shall pass over into the enlarged and remodelled University of Dublin. I come now to the question of the practical principles on which we hope Parliament will conduct that great academic reform to which I have pointed by means of the measure we are about to introduce. By what principles are we to be guided in that reform? Parliament has been recently engaged in reforming the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge; it has laid down very sound principles with respect to these Universities; these principles have not reached their fullest development, but still there they are; they have received deliberate sanction, and it is upon these principles that we propose to go with respect to the University of Dublin and Trinity College. What, then, are the great principles upon which Parliament has acted with respect to the English Universities? First of all, it has abolished tests. Upon this point there is practically no difference of opinion, because while the whole Liberal politicians of the country have desired that abolition for its own sake, under the circumstances of the time that boon is freely offered with an open hand by the authorities of Trinity College and the University of Dublin itself. But this is a negative rather than a positive reform. The next principle has been to open endowments. Where endowments are tied up by particular provisions in such a way as to render them the monopoly of comparatively few, Parliament has endeavoured to widen the access, and to increase the number of those who may  405 compete for them, with the conviction that that is the way to render them more fruitful of beneficial results. The next, and perhaps most important principle has been to emancipate the University from the Colleges. That is what we did at once in Oxford, and we did it in two ways. The first of them was the establishment of a new Governing Body. In Cambridge, the Caput, supplemented by conventional meetings of the Heads of Houses, in Oxford more formally the Hebdomadal Board, composed almost wholly of the Heads of Colleges were in practical possession of the initiative, and were the rulers of the University. We abolished the Hebdomadal Board in Oxford and the Caput in Cambridge, and carried over the powers in each case to the Council. And now similarly, that we should establish a new governing body for the University of Dublin is evidently the conclusion to which both principle and policy should bring us. The other great measure of emancipation consisted in the introduction within the Universities of members not belonging to any College at all. Until within the last few years, no one could belong to the University of Oxford or of Cambridge without belonging to some College or Hall within it, just as now no one can belong to the University of Dublin without belonging also to Trinity College. Parliament enabled the English Universities to enlarge their borders by taking in members not belonging to any College or Hall. Speaking for Oxford, I rejoice to say that Act has been fruitful of good; and already, although the change is a very recent one, there are 120 young men to be found in the University enjoying all the benefits of careful training, but all able to pursue a social scheme of their own, to live as economically as they please, to seek knowledge in the way they like best, provided they conform to the rules of the University; and we may reasonably expect that a very powerful element of University life will in this way ultimately be established. Another method by which we have proceeded I will not say to emancipate the Universities, but to make the Colleges conducive to the purposes of the University is a very important one, and that is, to use a very emphatic little word, by ""taxing"" the Colleges for the benefit of the Universities. That is a principle which has al- 406 ready received in Oxford a considerable development. We already oblige Corpus Christi, Magdalen, and All Souls Colleges to maintain Professors out of the College revenues, not for College but for University purposes; and as for Christ Church, with which I have been myself connected, though a poor College in comparison with Trinity College I greatly doubt whether it is half as wealthy yet in Christ Church five Professorships of Divinity, at a cost of probably between PS7,000 and PS8,000 a year, are maintained out of the property of the College for the benefit of the University. These, Sir, are the principles of academic reform on which we have proceeded in England. There are other principles which it would be necessary to observe in Ireland, in consequence of her peculiar circumstances; yet these are the main ones. But there are two points among those which the special case of Ireland brings before us, that I must particularly notice. To the one I would refer with some satisfaction at least as regards Trinity College to the other with pain. It is this. If we are about to found a University in Ireland in which we hope to unite together persons of the different religious persuasions into which the community is divided, we must be content to see sonic limitations of academical teaching. It would not be safe, in our opinion, to enter with our eyes open into largely controverted subjects. In theology no one would wish the University of Dublin, if it be reformed, to teach; and we also think there are some other subjects with regard to which it will be necessary to observe limitations that I will presently explain. There is another matter on which we must pursue a course somewhat different from that taken in England. In England, when we reformed the Universities, we may say we did nothing to increase the influence of the Crown. In Ireland, as far as Trinity College is concerned, I should not propose to increase the influence of the Crown. It appears to me that it may be safely limited. But if we are to have an effective and living Dublin University, with a new Governing Body, I am afraid it will be necessary to introduce for a time the action of Parliament and of the Crown in consequence of the unbalanced state of the University at the present  407 moment a state which must continue at all events for a time. When the University arrives at a condition in which the nation can be said to be fairly represented in it, then I think the desire of Parliament will be to carry over to the University itself, as far as may be, the power of electing all its own officers and Governing Body, and to see it thrive upon those principles of academic freedom which have been allowed so much of scope in this country, on the whole with such beneficial results. Well, Sir, these are the principles on which we propose to proceed. And, now, if the Committee will still have the kindness to follow me, I will endeavour to describe the mode in which those principles will be applied to the University of Dublin. And first, Sir, I must say it is necessary for clearness that the Committee should carefully keep in view three separate periods of time. The first period of time laid down in the Bill is the let of January, 1875. It is on the 1st of January, 1875, that we propose that the powers now exercised by the Provost and seven Senior Fellows of Trinity College as towards the University shall be handed over to the new Governing Body, just as in the English Universities the powers of the Hebdomadal Board and less exactly those of the Cambridge Heads were handed over to the new Governing Bodies, which represented mixed and diversified academic forces. The second period, after the 1st of January, 1875, is one of 10 years, which we look upon as a provisional period, during which it will be necessary to make some special provisions that I will by-and-by state summarily to the Committee. After the 1st of January, 1885, we think we may reckon that the new scheme will in all likelihood have developed itself so largely and so freely that the permanent system of government of the University may with safety be brought into play. I now proceed to explain the leading provisions of the Bill. First of all, the University is to be incorporated by the present Bill   a process which it has never yet undergone. The Universities of this country are incorporated; and it is more convenient and seemly that they should be incorporated than that a particular part namely, the Senate, as now  should be incorporated in a manner quite contrary to the analogy of our aca- 408 demical history. The second provision I will name is this the separation of the theological faculty. We propose to sever the theological faculty both from Trinity College, and from the University of Dublin. It appears to us that a measure of that kind follows naturally and of necessity from the changes that have already occurred in Ireland, and from the changes which have been offered on the part of the University and of Trinity College. I own it is not altogether without regret that I personally accede to that measure, for this reason: I think that the University of Dublin has exercised a most beneficial influence over the religious character, tone, and tendencies of a large and important portion of the Irish nation. But still I freely and advisedly believe that we are right in holding that this theological faculty ought now to be severed both from the University and from the College. The details of the operation will be found described in the clauses of the Bill from 10 to 15; and the method we pursue is this: It is as nearly as possible analogous to the method pursued under the Church Act in the case of Maynooth College. We hand over the care of the theological faculty to the Representative Body of the Disestablished Church. We make provision I hope ample provision for the vested interests of the persons now holding office in the theological faculty, or discharging duties in that faculty, as far as those duties are concerned. We provide that private endowments which have been created for the purposes of the theological faculty shall pass over to the Representative Body that Body to be subject to the same responsibilities as Trinity College will lie under, if the Bill be adopted, with reference to the private endowments in Trinity College. With regard to the rest of the change affecting the theological faculty, we propose to follow exactly the analogy of Maynooth. We ask you to grant 15 years' purchase of the annual expense; that is, a sum equal to 15 times the annual expense is to be handed over to the Representative Body, to be administered in trust for the purposes for which the theological faculty has existed. And, lastly, as the theological faculty severed from the University and from the College will no longer appear nor have accommodation in the buildings already existing, we propose that there should be a charge on the  409 property of the College of PS15,000 to provide buildings for the theological faculty. So much as to the theological faculty. I now come to the substantive and positive portion of our proposal, which I will describe as succinctly as I can. The principal parts and organs of the University of Dublin, as we propose that they should stand in its detached and reformed condition, are these: First of all there is the Chancellor of the University. The case of the Chancellorship of the University of Dublin is a very peculiar one, in this respect, that he is scarcely I speak subject to correction more than a nominal officer so far as regards the University. He has, indeed, the privilege of appointing the Vice Chancellor, but then the Vice Chancellor is, unfortunately, no less nominal than himself; for all that they can do is, when they are permitted by the College, to preside in the Senate; and when they preside there they are liable to be stopped at any moment by the action of the authorities of the College. But, although he is a nominal officer as to the University, he is not so as to the College. In virtue of his office of Chancellor of the University, he is Visitor of the College. As Visitor of the College he has all the ordinary powers of the Visitor of a College; and besides those ordinary powers he has another real and important power   namely, that his assent to the statutes of the College is required, I think, in certain rather important cases, to give them validity. And so we have had to consider, in detaching and severing the College functions from those of the University, what course to pursue as to the Chancellor. The course we recommend is this: We think it better, under all the circumstances, to continue the Chancellor of the University as if I may so speak an ornamental officer of the University, and, that being so, to attach the Chancellorship to the person of the Lord Lieutenant for the time being. This is not a question of making over an operative State influence. If it were so, the case would he materially altered. But, viewing all the difficulties which beset any other manner of proceeding, we recommend this as least open to objection. The Vice Chancellor we propose to leave it to the new Governing Body to elect from among themselves. He will, therefore, 410 be a real officer, with real functions namely, those which attach to the Chair of the Governing Body. But we also make provision that the present distinguished Chancellor of the University (Lord Cairns) shall not, by the action of the Bill, be divested of those substantive powers which he possesses powers, namely, which accrue to him in the character of Visitor of Trinity College, and the whole of which will be carefully preserved. That, Sir, is the proposal with respect to the Chancellor and the Vice Chancellor. Now, from what I have said, the House will readily understand that an important part of our proposal goes to fulfil that which has remained unfulfilled in the past by introducing new Colleges into the University of Dublin. If the House should adopt the suggestions that we have made with regard to the Queen's University and Queen's Colleges, the two first of such Colleges naturally will be those of Belfast and Cork. We shall also propose in Committee on the Bill, if agreeable to the parties, that the two voluntary institutions to which I think I have already referred namely, the College which is called the Roman Catholic University and the Magee College should become Colleges of the University of Dublin. I will afterwards explain what the effect of that will be. But, Sir, I by no means assume it as certain that these are the only Colleges in Ireland which might advantageously be joined to the University. We have not had the opportunity it was impossible in the privacy which these matters require of carrying on those communications with the parties able to inform us, which would be necessary in order to enable Parliament or to enable ourselves to form a judgment on the subject. When the Bill is placed in the hands of Members which I have little doubt will be to-morrow morning it will be seen that the first operative clauses enact that the Colleges enumerated in the Schedule to the Bill shall become Colleges of the University of Dublin. In turning to that Schedule it will be found that it is in blank; but I have already named four Colleges which it is our intention, if the parties are willing, to propose to insert in it when we go into Committee on the measure. And in the time that may elapse possibly a month before we go into Com-  411 mittee, we shall probably receive further information to enable us to judge whether it is desirable or not to lengthen the list. Of course, as I have stated, we do not confine ourselves to the collegiate element, but also allow persons to matriculate in the University without belonging to any College at all. The next change which I have to mention is probably the most important of all; it is the constitution of the new Governing Body of the University of Dublin. I have shown that we strictly follow the analogy of English legislation in substituting a new Governing Body for the old one, and as a necessary step in the process of emancipating I do not use the word in any invidious sense or detaching the University. But in the case of Oxford and Cambridge we had, already supplied to our hands, a large, free, well-balanced and composed constituency, to which we could at once intrust the election of the new Governing Body. This, it is evident, is not the case with respect to the University of Dublin. Were the new Governing Body to be elected at once by the Senate of the University of Dublin, it would represent one influence, and one influence only. We have, therefore, determined to introduce an intermediate or provisional period, and we shall not ask Parliament to place in the hands of the Crown the nomination of the Council which is to govern the University for that period; but, passing by the Crown, shall ask the Legislature itself in the main to nominate the list of persons for that purpose. I need hardly say that we are not now prepared to bring that list of persons before the House. It would be impossible for us to do it. It was impossible for us to ask gentlemen of eminence in Ireland to allow us to propose their names until we were aware of the general view which they would be disposed to take of the plans of the Government and of the intentions of Parliament; and I have already explained the reasons why it has not been within our power to hold any such communications. There is, however, one point on which I wish not to be misunderstood, and that is the principle on which we shall endeavour to make the selection of names which we shall submit to Parliament. There is, indeed, another class of members of the Council, to whom I shall presently refer; but I 412 speak now of the names we shall submit to Parliament of members whom I propose to call the ordinary members of the Council. They are 28 in number, and will form the principal and therefore the predominating portion of the Council. These names of ordinary members we shall endeavour to submit to Parliament, not as representatives of religious bodies as such, but on wider grounds. For we think that the lists should be composed  without excluding any class or any man on account of his religious profession from among all those persons in Ireland who, from their special knowledge or position, or from their experience, ability, character, and influence, may be best qualified at once to guard and to promote the work of academic education in Ireland. That is the principle on which we wish to make our choice, so far as we are concerned, and if we make it amiss, it will be in the power of Parliament to correct it. I will next, Sir, proceed to describe the manner in which the Council is to be brought into action. It will be necessary for it to perform certain preliminary functions before the 1st of January, 1875. It will have to matriculate students, to complete its number as I shall presently explain, and to make appointments of officers, so far as may be needed, to prepare it for entering on its career of full authority. On the 1st of January, 1875, it will take over those powers of ordinary government which have hitherto been exercised by the Provost and seven Senior Fellows of Trinity College. It will have the power to admit new Colleges over and above those named in the Act; it will have a general power of governing the University, and the function of appointing Professors and Examiners; and it is only in respect to the method of its own election that it will remain under an intermediate or provisional constitution until it reaches the year 1885, when its constitution will assume its permanent form. The composition of the Council will be made complete from the first. But I have not yet fully described the mode of its appointment. There will be the 28 ordinary members to be named in the statute, as I have already mentioned. During the 10 years from 1875 to 1885 the provisional period there will be, probably no great number, but still a certain number of vacancies in the Body which  413 it will be necessary for us to make provision to fill up. For that limited period we propose that the vacancies should be filled alternately by the Crown and by co-optation on the part of the Council itself. At the expiration of the 10 years it will come to its permanent constitution, and I will describe what that, as we propose it, is to be; and then the Committee will be able to judge of the meaning of what I said when I stated that our desire was that the University of Dublin should be founded, as far as possible, on principles of academic freedom. After 10 years, we propose that service on the Council shall be divided into four terms of seven years each, four members retiring in each successive year. There will therefore be four vacancies among the 28 ordinary members to be filled up every year, and these four vacancies we propose shall be filled in rotation first, by the Crown; secondly, by the Council itself; thirdly, by the Professors of the University; and fourthly, by the Senate of the University. There is a separate provision with regard to casual vacancies in the Council, to which I need not now more particularly refer. The ordinary members will constitute, according to the proposal of the Government, the main stock or material of the Council or Governing Body of the University; but we have been very desirous to see in what way that which we aim at may meet the general wants and wishes of the people of Ireland; and, considering how desirable it is to prevent the action of too strong an unitarian principle I have, I believe, ample authority for using that word, which is familiar in the present politics of Germany we have been very anxious to discover in what manner it might be possible to give to those bodies, which I have described as Colleges of the University, a fair opportunity, not of governing the action of the Council by any exertion of influence or combination among themselves, but of being heard in the Council, so that all views and desires with respect to education might be fairly brought into open discussion, and that right might have the best chance of prevailing. It is evident we could not adopt the system under which any one College should be allowed to send to the Council a large number of members. It is also evident that it would not be safe to adopt a system 414 under which Colleges, insignificant in magnitude, should be permitted to claim a representation in the Council. What we wish is this that considerable Colleges, which represent a large section of the community and of its educating force, should have a fair opportunity of making their voice heard in the Council. With regard to all those dangers which would be likely to arise from too great a rigour of unity in the examinations, or too narrow a choice in their subjects and tone, though we introduce several other provisions on the point into the Bill, it is to the freedom and elasticity of the Council itself, I think, that we should look as the main security against anything either inequitable or unwise. We propose, then, that there shall be in the Council from the outset that is to say, from the 1st of January, 1875 a certain number of what we call collegiate members, the basis of whose position in the Council will be that any College of the University which has 50 of its matriculated students, those students being in statu pupillari matriculated also as members of the University, may send one member to the Council, and if such College have 150 students, then it may send two members. That would be the maximum; and this element, so far as we can judge, while it ought to be and will be secondary in point of numbers, would become very valuable and necessary for the purpose to which I have just adverted. The Senate of the University of Dublin, as it now exists, does not, I may observe, discharge one of the living and standing duties which a University is called upon to perform. I mean the election of Representatives to be sent to Parliament. The election of Representatives for the Dublin University is mainly conducted by gentlemen who, except for that purpose, do not belong to the University at all that is to say, who have ceased to belong to it, and who are empowered to exercise with regard to it no other function. What we propose is that henceforward the Senate shall elect the Representatives of the University. The Senate will, of course, consist of all those who are now in it, and of all the doctors and masters who may hereafter have their names kept on it according to the rules which may be in force. I need not add that care will be taken that all those individuals who are now intrusted with the privilege of the franchise will  415 have their rights preserved; but, for the future, we should lay down the principle that the Members for the University ought to be elected by the Senate as they now are by the Senate of Cambridge and the Convocation of Oxford, and by them alone. As to the duty of the Senate, it will be to discharge the duties heretofore discharged by the old Senate of the University, and to share in the election of the Council in the manner I have described after the provisional period has passed, and the permanent constitution comes into play. I hope it is now understood what our proposal is with regard to the constitution of the University. And now as to those who are to compose it. I need not say that all the members of Trinity College will remain where they are. With regard to the Queen's University, we should propose to absorb the whole of its members in the Senate and the body of the University of Dublin, together with all the privileges which now attach to their respective degrees or standing. There is a further provision which we have made in order to accelerate that consummation which we all desire namely, the rapid introduction into the University of Dublin of those varied elements that we hope will vindicate for it the title of a truly national institution. There is no difficulty in the matter as far as Trinity College and the Queen's Colleges are concerned; because their alumni have already undergone University education in a recognised institution. But how are we to deal with Magee College and with any other Roman Catholic Colleges which have not any academic status in the eye of the State, and which, therefore, cannot be treated by this Bill as if they had been heretofore possessed of this advantage? In our opinion it would be a great hardship on those Colleges, if their alumni were to be absolutely excluded from the Dublin University. We have, however, only a limited power in the matter, and what we propose in their favour is a temporary provision to the effect that, during the first three years after January, 1875, the University may, if it shall think fit, introduce into it, subject to examination, persons who have not been at any University, or College of an University, but who shall be certified to have resided for any given time as students of any College which is henceforward to 416 belong to the University, and that an arrangement shall be made to give to such persons the advantage of the Terms which they shall have already kept. I shall now proceed to detail the securities for conscience that will be taken in framing the constitution of the renovated University. The Committee will have gathered from what I have said that this University is to be a teaching as well as an examining University; but it is to teach under conditions in some respects limited. It can have no chair in theology; and we have arrived at the conclusion that the most safe and prudent course we can adopt is to preclude the University from the establishment of chairs in two other subjects, which, however important in themselves in an educational point of view, would be likely to give rise to hopeless contention; and were we to propose that the new University should be at liberty to establish chairs in respect of them, we should be running the most fatal risk of introducing misgiving and mistrust, which might be fatal, with regard to the rights of conscience in the new University. The two subjects to which I refer are philosophy and modern history. [Laughter.] I do not mean that the study of natural science is to be omitted from the list of chairs, I only refer to that of moral and metaphysical philosophy. We feel that our asking for the foundation of chairs in these subjects would be impossible in the case of a mixed University, unless we gave up all hope of obtaining for that University the general confidence of the Irish people. And permit me to say that by excluding theology from the University we do very little if in that University, under the circumstances of the present day, we appoint authorised teachers in certain branches of philosophy, because all the deepest questions of religious belief are at this moment contested, partly, indeed, within the theological precinct, but even more so in the domain of ethics, and especially of metaphysics. The House may or may not overrule the Government in this matter; but, at any rate, that is the conclusion at which we have arrived with reference to this question. There is another important security for the rights of conscience with respect to the same subjects which I will mention to the House. We propose that no one shall be examined for his degree in  417 modern history or philosophy, as I have defined it, except with his own free will. We do not think it necessary to exclude these subjects from the examination, provided the submission to examination in them is voluntary. As I have said already, the University is to be a teaching University; but we propose to extend the voluntary principle still further, and to provide that as a rule no attendance upon the lectures of the University Professors shall be compulsorily required from the students. We intend to trust to the excellence of the instruction which will be given, and to the vast advantages the University will enjoy from being placed in the metropolis of Ireland for the attraction of students to it; but we propose to make the attendance upon the lectures of its Professors voluntary. We propose, also, to exclude the two subjects I have lately named from the examinations for the emoluments of the University. From the examinations for honours we do not propose to exclude them, and for this reason. It is perfectly practicable to adopt the system of a positive standard as regards examinations even for honours, and you may bring up to that standard any number of men who show themselves competent to reach it; but as regards emoluments, the competition must be between man and man; what one gains the other must lose, and therefore we think it the best and safest method of managing these emoluments to provide that these men should meet upon a common ground upon which all can equally consent to be examined. There are some other provisions of the same kind in the Bill, because I need not say that these securities for conscience are among the most important safeguards of the Bill, and unless they are effective we cannot expect the Bill to work, neither should we desire it to be accepted by the House. Among these, we have provided a clause somewhat analogous to one which appears in the Education Act with reference to the punishment of masters who persistently offend against the conscientious scruples of the children whose education they conduct. We provide that a teacher in the University may be punished or reprimanded if he wilfully offends the conscientious scruples of those whom he instructs in the exercise of his office. But I am bound to say that the main security for the rights of 418 conscience on which we rely is such a representation of all parties, within moderate and safe limits, in the body of the Council, as can be usefully and beneficially introduced into its constitution. The next and the last of the more difficult subjects I shall have to lay before you is that which relates to the contribution which Trinity College will have to make to the University of Dublin. It appeared to us in reference to this subject that one principle was absolute, and could not be made the subject of discussion in this House. That was the principle that the present office bearers and teachers in Trinity College should not be made losers by the direct operation of the Act. The charge resulting from the adoption of this principle will probably amount on a rough estimate to about one-half of the entire value of the property of the College. If this mode of proceeding should be adopted for giving security to their interests, we shall propose that the residue of the property of the College shall be divided into two moieties, one of which shall pass to the new University, and the other shall remain the property of the College. The proposition will, of course, leave untouched the income derived by the College from voluntary payments. This is a principle on which we have already acted to some extent in England; but at present we have not carried it out so far as will, I apprehend, be thought necessary in future. A Commission is at present sitting for the purpose of examining into the property of the Universities and Colleges in England, and there cannot be a doubt, from such knowledge of opinions as I possess, that when that Commission reports, it will be found necessary, after making the most liberal provision for the wants of the Colleges themselves, that considerable sums, especially in Cambridge, where the principle has as yet been applied only to a very limited extent, will be available for the requirements of the University. It is only fair that, as the degrees conferred by the Universities bring people to the Colleges, the latter should contribute to the support of the former. And it will especially be fair to adopt this principle with regard to Trinity College, seeing that it has received all its endowments not simply for performing the duties and functions of a College but also that  419 it might be mater universitatis, that its means might be available for an University. The property of Trinity College is estimated in round numbers at PS55,000 a year. Between an increase in the amount of the rents and the interest of a large sum of money which it will receive on account of its ecclesiastical advowsons it will immediately have an increment of PS7,000 or PS8,000 a year. The voluntary payments amount to about PS23,000 a year, making in all PS86,000 a year prospectively, and PS78,000 at present. Its expenses are stated at PS66,000 a year and some hundreds, and there is a surplus of receipts above expenditure of PS11,600. Under these circumstances, what we propose to do I will now explain. That mode of proceeding to which I lately referred namely, the mode of charging the property with the vested interests and providing for a division of the ultimate residue although it proceeds upon an intelligible principle, yet in practice would be operose, slow, and perhaps vexatious as to details. It would give room for differences of opinion. We have therefore placed a provision for giving effect to that proceeding only in a Schedule to the Bill. In the Bill itself we have introduced provisions of a very simple character, to this effect that upon the property of Trinity College there shall be laid a charge of PS12,000 a year, to be redeemed within 14 years, and at 25 years' purchase. I have already stated that the surplus revenue over its expenditure is more than PS11,000; and PS12,000 a year, deducted from PS78,000, which appears to be the total receipt, would leave PS66,000, or, deducted from PS55,000 a year, the present estimated property of Trinity College, it would leave PS43,000 a year, with an immediate impending increment of PS7,000 or PS8,000, making an endowment from these sources equivalent to about PS50,000 a year. In truth, after making the charge of contribution which we propose to take for the benefit of the University, Trinity College would remain perhaps the wealthiest College in existence in Christendom. At any rate I am aware of only one rival namely, Trinity College, Cambridge, which educates and teaches nearly the same number as are educated and taught in Trinity College, Dublin. Undoubtedly there are other influences that would act on Trinity College in connection with this 420 Bill. It will lose its profits from degrees, which are stated at PS2,300 per annum. But there are various provisions in the Bill which would enable Trinity College to economise its operations, and I must say, without fear of offence, that there are great and needful economies to be effected in Trinity College itself. We have introduced into this Bill a provision intended to facilitate the transfer in certain cases of Trinity College Professors to University Chairs. There may be cases in which Trinity College, as discharging the duties of an University, had to incur the expense of maintaining a very large and complete staff of Chairs where we think it might be for the convenience and advantage of all parties that in some of those instances Trinity College might make over its Professors to the University, and with its Professors the charge of maintaining them. These are the leading provisions, which I think contain the essential outline of the plan, so far as Trinity College is concerned. I will now point out, in a very few words, what would be the position of the University according to our proposition with respect to what it will require in order to full efficiency, and with respect to the sources from which the money is to be had. We think this University of Dublin, if it is to be the great national University of Ireland in accordance with its original design, should be liberally supplied first, with the means of teaching; and, secondly, with the means of encouraging and rewarding study. We have not inserted in the Bill any of the provisions which I am now going to sketch, but it is right that I should state to the House what our views are; because it may be thought expedient when we come to the Committee on the Bill actually to determine the amount of the property which shall be placed at the disposal of the University of Dublin. We think there might be ten fellowships, of PS200 a year each, given annually by way of reward, and tenable for five years, which, for fifty fellowships in all, would entail a charge of 210,000. We think there might be 25 annual exhibitions of PS50 each, tenable for four years, which would entail a total charge, when they were in full operation, of PS5,000. We think there might be 100 bursaries a year of PS25 each, tenable for four years, creating an annual charge of PS2,500 or  421 in the whole PS10,000. These bursaries would be of the greatest advantage in stimulating the youth of Ireland; and to establish them would be to do something analogous to that which has been done with such great advantage by private benefactors in Scotland for the encouragement of study in the Scotch Universities. These grants for the encouragement and reward of study would in the whole amount to PS25,000 a year. The charge for the professors' chairs might possibly be from PS15,000 to PS20,000 a year more, which might create a charge of PS45,000 a year. The other charges would be those for examinations, for the ordinary government of the University, and for the buildings which would be necessary for lecturing and teaching purposes. PS12,000 a year, as I have said, is the contribution of Trinity College to University purposes from the fulfilment of which it is to be relieved. PS10,000 a year is the equivalent, or very nearly, of what the Consolidated Fund now pays for Galway College and the Queen's University. We conceive that a further sum of PS5,000 a year may be obtained for the University by means of fees on a very moderate scale. Our view is that for the remainder of the money required for the purposes of the University we may most properly and beneficially resort to the surplus of the ecclesiastical property of Ireland. It will be remembered that this surplus is to be made available for the national wants of Ireland. The present state of things with regard to it is this. The property of the Irish Church was estimated at PS16,000,000. The amount charged upon it from all sources in connection with the liquidation of the Maynooth Grant, the liquidation of the Regium Donum, and all the rest was taken at PS11,000,000, and the surplus at PS5,000,000. I am told that no more precise estimate can be given at this date. Parliament has legislatively declared that that surplus shall be mainly, but it has not said that it shall be exclusively, devoted to the relief of corporal wants and necessities. If that devotion to corporal wants and necessities is not to be exclusive, I know no more just purpose to which the residue could be applied than in aiding the funds of the new University. In our opinion it would be most just to make a call upon a portion, though it need be only a very 422 limited portion, of the surplus ecclesiastical property of Ireland. There are only two other points that I have to name in the very lengthened statement which I am inflicting upon the House. We do not propose to introduce into this Bill any plan for the internal reform of Trinity College. So far as we are concerned, we wish to place in the Governing Body of Trinity the same confidence that they will effect, or suggest, all necessary reforms as has been placed in the Governing Bodies of the English Colleges. We propose to relieve it from its absolute dependence upon the Crown; and to place it upon the same footing as that on which the Colleges of Oxford and Cambridge now stand namely, the footing on which they are authorized to prepare schemes for the regulation of their own government, which schemes, when they have gone through the ordeal of being passed by the Queen in Council, may have the force of law. As I am reminded by my right hon. Friend (Mr. Cardwell), we have, of course, framed clauses for the purpose of at once opening the offices and emoluments of Trinity College, without any religious test. I took this matter so much for granted that I had almost omitted to mention it. I have thus ventured to sketch the measure we propose for establishing a free if I may not say an emancipated  University of Dublin. Let me say a word or two now as to the future position of the Colleges in that University. Trinity College, as I have shown, will undoubtedly no longer have the exclusive power of granting degrees, though it must always largely influence by its intrinsic weight the movements of the University. It will have a certain diminution of income by the contribution we shall take from it; and it may, I grant, with respect especially to its non-resident students, undergo a certain diminution in numbers, and thus the amount of its voluntary payments. But what will it have upon the other side? In the first place, it will have, as I hope, a termination to controversy at least, to all political controversy. It will remain, as I trust, in its outward dwelling unchanged. There will be nothing to break the course of its traditions. Long  I trust for generations and for ages it will continue to dispense, more unrestrainedly than ever, the blessings of a  423 liberal culture. It will enjoy self-governing powers, subject only to a reasonable control, and free, I think, from all apprehension of vexatious interference. It will undoubtedly receive some new form of constitution, in which the important and valuable Working Body of Trinity College will exercise far more power than it exercises now, which, indeed, is only moral power, whereas the actual power of the actual Teaching Body of Trinity College, if I understand aright, is none whatever. The present University statutes and the existing system of examination in Trinity College will necessarily form the starting-point for the proceedings of Dublin University, and it will be for the Council of Dublin University to consider how far these may require either expansion or modification. Trinity College will have the means of being heard in the Council, because there will be more, many more, than 150 of its members of the matriculated students of Trinity College who will be members of Dublin University; and it must therefore have the power of sending two members to the Council. Its students will have access to a large number of additional emoluments. But here arises a question. Is it fair that those who already possess the rich emoluments of Trinity College should have free access to the emoluments of the University of Dublin, such as I have sketched them? The fair rule, as we think, will be this: In our opinion it would not be right or wise to enact any exclusion of any person belonging to the University from competition for the emoluments of the University in respect to his belonging to any particular body, however richly endowed; but we propose to provide that no holder of public academical emoluments in Ireland and in the interpretation clause we have defined what we mean by public academical emoluments  shall hold any one of the emoluments, encouragements or rewards of the new University, without surrendering the prior academic emoluments which he holds. The effect will be that a member of Trinity College will have everything thrown open to him; but he must not hold both his own and the University emoluments. He must take his choice, and I suppose he will choose to take the best, whichever it may be. This limitation of pluralities, so to call them, has re- 424 ference to emoluments of encouragement and reward, not to teaching offices. For example, with regard to the Junior Fellows of Trinity College, there will be no such limitation, for it would be absurd to apply the rule to a Junior Fellow receiving only PS40 a-year and, I believe, PS40 Irish from his Fellowship and the rest of his income from his labour. Trinity College will have, upon the whole, access to a large number of academic emoluments; and, in common with every other College in Dublin, and especially with the Roman Catholic University College, it will enjoy one, as I think, very great advantage to which I have not yet referred. The University will place at its doors, not an absolutely complete, but a nearly complete, staff of professional chairs. These chairs will, I hope, be held with tolerably liberal remuneration by men of high reputation, and it will be in the power either of Trinity College, or of the Roman Catholic College, or of any College, to consider whether it shall be at the expense of maintaining chairs, which may in certain cases entail a corresponding charge, heavy in proportion to their importance; or whether it shall avail itself, without any charge at all beyond a moderate fee, of lectures which will be delivered at its doors. All these appear to me to be important compensating considerations, so far as Trinity College is concerned. Now, what will be the position of voluntary Colleges? and I hope they may somewhat multiply, though a Roman Catholic College is the only one actually existing in Dublin. They will enjoy an entire freedom as to internal government. With respect to ecclesiastical and lay power, I submit that in those voluntary institutions the parties must settle this question among themselves. If it passes their wisdom to do it, it passes our wisdom too. All we can do is to give them an open career and fair play; and I think it will be seen that the access to University degrees will henceforth be perfectly free to the members of these Colleges. Together with free access to University degrees, there will be free access to University emoluments upon a large scale for them and for all Ireland. If their numbers entitle them to send one, or possibly in some rare case, two members to the Council, they will have the power  425 to make their view, whatever it may be, known in the Council, and they will, if in Dublin, have the same power to economize their own resources to whatever extent they may think fit by making use of the chairs of the University. If more than this be asked if it be said ""this is not establishing the equality we want to establish between the Roman Catholics and Trinity College"" my answer is plain. It is that Trinity College is a public institution. It has been, and it will remain, under a certain control by the Crown and by Parliament. But more than that, it is an institution which although I admit the operation of this change must be very slow has voluntarily renounced its denominational safeguards, and which proposes to make the whole of its emoluments and offices accessible to all Irishmen who may be its members, entirely irrespective of religious distinctions. Parliament has adopted for many years in its policy the principle that these are the Colleges to which alone public endowments shall be given. And if I am told, on the other hand, that Trinity College has a great start in the race, while among Roman Catholics, and to a certain extent among Presbyterians, almost everything has still to be organized, I admit the fact; but I know of no cure save one to strip Trinity College bare of its estates and to destroy its whole machinery. Such a proceeding would really be the creation of solitude in order to call it peace. But it is a remedy which has never been tolerated or even heard of, and never would be tolerated or, I hope, heard of, within the walls of the British Parliament. Sir, I feel that the House of Commons must look forward to the end of this speech with much the same feeling as it generally looks forward to the end of the Session, and that the sense of relief when it arrives will be very much the same. I have very few words more to speak. This is an important I would almost say, considering the many classes it concerns and the many topics it involves, it is almost a solemn subject; solemn from the issues which depend upon it. We have approached it with the desire to soothe and not exasperate. I hope that in the lengthened address I have delivered to the House I have not said anything that can offend. If I have been so unfortunate, it is entirely contrary to my intention and my honest 426 wish. We, Sir, have done our best. We have not spared labour and application in the preparation of this certainly complicated, and, I venture to hope, also comprehensive, plan. We have sought to provide a complete remedy for what we thought, and for what we have long marked and held up to public attention as a palpable grievance   a grievance of conscience. But we have not thought that, in removing that grievance, we were discharging either the whole or the main part of our duty. It is one thing to clear away obstructions from the ground; it is another to raise the fabric. And the fabric which we seek to raise is a substantive, organized system, under which all the sons of Ireland, be their professions, be their opinions what they may, may freely meet in their own ancient, noble, historic University for the advancement of learning in that country. The removal of grievance is the negative portion of the project; the substantive and positive part of it, academic reform. We do not ask the House to embark upon a scheme which can be described as one of mere innovation. We ask you now to give to Ireland that which has been long desired, which has been often attempted, but which has never been attained; and we ask you to give it to Ireland, in founding yourselves upon the principles on which you have already acted in the Universities of England. We commit the plan to the prudence and the patriotism of this House, which we have so often experienced, and in which the country places, as we well know, an entire confidence. I will not lay stress upon the evils which will flow from its failure, from its rejection, in prolonging and embittering the controversies which have for many, for too many years been suffered to exist. I would rather dwell upon a more pleasing prospect upon my hope, even upon my belief, that this plan in its essential features may meet with the approval of the House and of the country. At any rate, I am convinced that if it be your pleasure to adopt it, you will by its means enable Irishmen to raise their country to a height in the sphere of human culture such as will be worthy of the genius of the people, and such as may, perhaps, emulate those oldest, and possibly best, traditions of her history upon which Ireland still so fondly dwells."	189.0	1873.0	1870	[('little',

555368	555368	S3V0306P0-01677	1886-06-01	SECOND READING. [ADJOURNED DEBATE.] [NINTH NIGHT.]	MR. SEXTON	Sligo, S.	"MR. SEXTON (Sligo, S.): Sir, I trust that the physique of hon. Members of this House will not be held to have a  701 very practical bearing on these great issues before us; and whatever may be contributed in the debates on these great questions, hon. Members will agree with me that in the matter of physique the right hon. Gentleman opposite (Mr. J. Chamberlain) has very little to boast of as compared with my hon. and learned Friend (Mr. Healy). The right hon. Gentleman has stated that a Dissolution has no terrors for him. Why should it? The right hon. Gentleman will go the country masquerading as a Unionist Liberal, but depending on the regular Tory vote. The right hon. Gentleman has already found a very good godfather in the shape of Lord Brabourne. Lord Brabourne has appealed to the Tory electors of West Birmingham to save the right hon. Gentleman from political extinction. Did ever misfortune make an ex-Radical Liberal acquainted with a stranger bedfellow than Lord Brabourne? The right hon. Gentleman has made a very misleading allusion to the case of Canada. The analogy between Canada and Ireland rests not on details but on principles. The principles of resemblance are that Canada was discontented and rebellious till she got what she wanted, and when she obtained what she wanted she became contented and loyal. The difference between Canada and Ireland is this that Canada is 3,000 miles away, whilst Ireland is three hours' sail of this country. When Canada got what she wanted she became loyal and contented, and the substance of what we want is contained in the pages of this Bill; and if that Bill passed into law the settlement arrived at in the case of Canada will be precisely and absolutely reproduced in the case of Ireland. The speech of the right hon. Gentleman has been welcome to us in one respect. It has cleared away the smoke from the field of battle. It has defined the opposing hosts. It has enabled Ireland to see at last, beyond the possibility of a doubt, who are her enemies and who are her friends. It has enabled her to distinguish between the true friends and the false ones, and I promise the right hon. Gentleman that so long as this generation of men lasts on the face of the earth Ireland will never forget this day. Sir, the right hon. Gentleman for weeks past has been fighting under cover. At last we have got him in the open, and we mean, until this question 702 is finally settled, not to let him get back into the bush. He has been fighting under cover by means of a series of mysterious paragraphs and dubious and suggestive little lists, and he has been creating a certain effect by secret meetings of a small but not homogeneous body of hon. Members of this House, who have produced excellent stage effects under the guidance of an adjutant in the shape of the hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Caine) by a series of rapid and interesting evolutions. It requires an effort of memory to recall the fact that the right hon. Gentleman was but lately a Radical Leader. The Radicals of Britain looked to him to maintain the rights and to assert the principles of the working population of this country against monopoly and exclusive class privilege. The working men of England looked to him to mould the policy of the Liberal Party, and influence the mind of the Prime Minister and the Government for their advantage; but the right hon. Gentleman, who might be powerful as a coadjutor, is fated to be impotent as a rebel. In what character does the right hon. Gentleman address the House to-day? It is as the ally of Tories, as the confederate of Whigs, as the deserter of his Party, as one who contrives the downfall of the Prime Minister, the break-up of the Liberal Party, the destruction of that Party the destruction of that Party as a weapon and an instrument of progress. He appears as one who, whatever the purpose of his conduct may be and I do not feel called upon to analyze it whatever his purpose is the effect of it, if he was successful, could not be other than this to give over the working men of England to the advocates and champions of class privileges and monopoly. He appears to consider the people of unfortunate Ireland who have had given to them by the Prime Minister a Bill which affords a glimpse of freedom he appears to consider those unfortunate people worthy only to be handed over and consigned to the double policy of Lord Salisbury namely, the enforced emigration or expatriation of 1,000,000 of Irish people, and a firm and unflinching repression of 20 years' stern coercion. We hear a great deal about ""one man government;"" but probe the question to the bottom, and, in my opinion, in all ques-  703 tions of the kind it will always be, and continue to be, a question between one man and another. The question for the Liberal Party is, which one man will it have? The Prime Minister occupied a place in the Government of this country when the right hon. Gentleman opposite occupied a perambulator, or some similar unpretending structure. The Prime Minister directed the policy of this country, guided its Government, guarded its interests, protected its structure, and developed its resources at a time when the respectable, but not dazzling, talents of the right hon. Gentleman opposite (Mr. J. Chamberlain) found an occupation in the respectable, if not dazzling, sphere of Mayor of Birmingham. Nature intended the right hon. Gentleman to be a Mayor. He is intellectually a Mayor still. I think that when the question between one man and another comes before the electors of Great Britain, the Liberal electors of Great Britain will not reject the experience and genius or the insight of the Prime Minister, by universal confession the foremost statesman and first reformer of the generation they will not desert him and turn for aid to the ex-Mayor of Birmingham as their guide, philosopher, and friend. I cannot congratulate the right hon. Member upon the cheerfulness of his manner in speaking to-day. His voice, it appeared to me, had a hollow and sepulchral sound, as if it came from out of a cave. I believe the right hon. Gentleman does not like to have it called a cave; he prefers it being called a chasm. Well, I accept the amendment, for if you go into a cave you can come out of it when you like, even if you have to crawl out on your hands and knees a posture to which, as far as I can learn, the right hon. Gentleman has no marked repugnance. But if you get into a chasm the chances are that will stay there; and I certainly think that the chasm, which is the result and the handiwork of the right hon. Gentleman, will prove to be the last political resting place of himself and his ingenuous adherents. The most ingenuous I take to be the hon. Member for Burnley (Mr. Rylands), who cheered him so heartily during his speech; but the difference between the right hon. Gentleman and the hon. Gentleman is that the right hon. Gentleman got afraid sitting above the Gangway, and the hon. Gentleman got afraid sit- 704 ting below the Gangway. Even great political struggles have their comic and laughter-moving elements, and these are to a certain extent supplied by the hon. Member for Burnley, who reminds one of the boy in chase of the rainbow the rainbow being an imaginary Chancellorship of the Exchequer in an impossible coalition. The chasm of the right hon. Gentleman was constructed on the Calais-Douvres principle; it had two bottoms, the second being the noble Marquess the Member for Rossendale (the Marquess of Hartington) and his Friends. Neither the people of Ireland nor their friends had had any cause to regret that the Motion for the rejection of the Bill had proceeded from the noble Marquess. The Prime Minister had justly said and the country in the depths of its intelligence has found the absolute truth of the saying that the spirit and power of class formed the main body of the host in opposition to the Bill. It is well that the issues should be frankly laid before the country; and if the spirit and power of class do typify, as I believe they do, the opposition to the Bill, they could not find a more adequate Representative than in the person of the noble Marquess the Member for Rossendale. I have treated, and always shall treat, the noble Marquess with the respect which no Irishman ever fails to give to a frank and manly enemy. The noble Marquess has not gone about the country since last Session with a programme of his own, and he has not declared with many brave words that he would never join a Government unless his programme was adopted, and then accepted Office. He has not gone with the Government in order to chose a most suitable moment for ruining the Irish and Liberal measures. The noble Marquess is not moved and certainly no one suspects him of being actuated by any sentiments of vanity or spleen. He does not consider that his merits have not been sufficiently appreciated, neither is he burning with secret rage at the preferment of any other man. The noble Marquess is a frank and manful enemy of Home Rule for Ireland. He refused to enter into the Cabinet, although the Prime Minister had laid it down that any settlement of the Home Rule Question must be consistent with the supremacy of the Crown, with the integrity of the Empire, and  705 the Sovereignty of the Imperial Parliament. Notwithstanding this ample accumulation of guarantees the noble Marquess refused to enter the Cabinet, because he would not tolerate the principle of Home Rule in any form. Therefore it does not devolve upon me to argue the principle of the Bill with him, as he will not accept it on any terms. I apprehend that the noble Marquess in his opposition is thinking more of Great Britain than he is of Ireland. He knows that though the Irish Party is only a small Party in the House, still it is the pioneer of great social and political reforms. He knows that their example has been fruitful in the mind of Great Britain. He apprehends that a Legislature of her own, freely enacting laws with a single mind for the good of the Irish people, would set an example that would be speedily fruitful in Great Britain, that would not be to the interest of the pretensions and powers and privileges of his class. That may be an excellent reason for the noble Marquess to oppose this Bill, but, Sir, it is a conclusive reason why the people of Great Britain should support it. The noble Marquess has offered us some mouldy crumbs of local self-government such crumbs as may fall from the table of the Dives, and be given to the beggar at the gate. Ireland does not stand here as a beggar. Ireland asks her right, and I have never heard that the meagre benefaction that was given to Lazarus had any effect upon the rich man's ultimate destination. The noble Marquess talks vaguely of the reform of Dublin Castle; but if he had learned the alphabet of government he would know that to reform the administration of the law and leave the system of law untouched is to begin at the wrong end of the reform. If you reform the administration of the law and leave the system still untouched you do not gain more acceptance for the system of law, you only ruin the administration of it. The only way the only permanent way to meet the demands is to make both the law and the administration of the law accepted by the people, because they spring from their own native authority. I tell the noble Marquess that while he concerns himself with the administration of the law and leaves the fundamental system untouched he is wasting time, just as a sailor scrubbing the deck when 706 a leak had sprung in the hold. It seemed at one time probable that the noble Marquess and the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Birmingham (Mr. J. Chamberlain) harboured the hope of forming a Government of their own. We are told that they had a negative policy and a positive policy. In effect the negative policy was to throw out the Prime Minister, and their positive policy was to step into his place. Well, Sir, it would have been almost worth while if such vast interests were not involved to the cynical student of human affairs, to see how the Head of the territorial Whigs and the deposed First Consul of the Caucus would manage to get along together how the heir of the Dukedom of Devonshire, and the patrimony belonging thereto, and the author of the doctrine of ""ransom"" would have agreed on a common policy. What measures would they propose what measures of coercion or conciliation? How even they could get re-elected by their constituents in short, how long and in what manner they would conduct the work of government with a Party not extending far beyond the limits of the Treasury Bench, with two Oppositions sitting on that side of the House and one Opposition on the other, with mediocracy supporting them, and the country brooding over the instructive spectacle of the mean talents and the limited experience of the right hon. Member for Mid Lothian (Mr. Gladstone) consigned to a back Bench below the Gangway. But, Sir, whatever may be the question for the Liberal Party, the question for the country is not between the noble Marquess or the right hon. Member for Birmingham and the Prime Minister. The question for the country is between the Prime Minister and the Marquess of Salisbury. The noble Marquess is the only alternative to the Prime Minister the only alternative to the policy of Home Rule and conciliation, is a policy of forced emigration and of 20 years of coercion. We have not learned that from what the Tories say in this House. Here the Tory Leaders are very silent. I say the Tory Leaders, because I cannot recognize as a Tory Leader yet the American Gentleman the hon. Member for Eccleshall (Mr. Ashmead-Bartlett), who addressed this House as an officer of Militia. The Tory Leaders are silent here, but they are not silent everywhere. Indeed,  707 I can find some reason for their silence, because it must be distressing for so astute a gentleman and so very profound a strategist as the noble Member for Paddington (Lord Randolph Churchill) to be condemned to serve under a Leader who just at the wrong moment showed that he had the temper of the leader of a herd of buffaloes. The policy of the Marquess of Salisbury is plain. His alternative is, that if money is to be spent in Ireland, it is to be spent, not in buying out his friends the landlords from the hands of the Jews, but it is to be spent in carrying out the forced emigration of the Irish people. But a question precedent to the carrying out of that policy is, Will the Irish people emigrate? The Irish people never willingly leave their native land. They only leave it as a last resource, and when they are without hope of getting a living in it. But are they without hope now? The Prime Minister has told them that their claim is expedient that their demand for self-government is just and right, and that it ought to be acceded to. That declaration is adopted by the bulk of the Liberal Party. It has been enthusiastically affirmed by great assemblies of Englishmen, and with that moral and physical strength on their side the Irish people shall never be driven from the land that they are destined to rule. Why, Sir, if you emigrate 1,000,000, and turn discontented men at home into bitter enemies abroad, those who remain will become more troublesome. You will have to emigrate a second 1,000,000, and a third, and when the majority are disposed of, and only the ""Loyal minority"" remains, the hon. and gallant Member for North Armagh (Major Saunderson) will make an irresistible demand upon the British House of Commons for a separate Irish Parliament in the name of a really united Ireland. The hon. and gallant Member will, of course, then be older, though I apprehend he will never be very much wiser, and, I have no doubt, in him the Government would find a much more troublesome and turbulent neighbour than my hon. Friend the Member for the City of Cork. But emigration or no emigration, we are to have 20 years of coercion. [Cries of ""No, no!""] Did not the Marquess of Salisbury say that we were to have 20 years of firm and un- 708 flinching repressive government? But he also said that at the end of 20 years you might then consider whether Ireland would be in a condition fit to repeal it. How could you repeal a thing if it was not in existence? Not only did the noble Marquess say that, but his whole speech from beginning to end was consistent with no other interpretation. He compared us to Hottentots in our unfitness for Home Rule. Well, tastes may differ, but I would rather be an average Hottentot, a fair average Hottentot with such a feeling of modified spasmodic honesty and respect for his word as an average Hottentot may be supposed to possess than be the British political Leader who crawled into Office last year by repudiating coercion, who tried to hold Office by coquetting with Home Rule, and who now had the audacity to endeavour to regain Office by favouring that which he formerly denounced, and by discrediting that which he had embraced, and who did all this in the face of the world in the lapse of one single year. The Marquess of Salisbury on May 10 told the country that the Irish people not a section of them, but the whole Irish people had acquired the bad habit of using knives and slugs. He also said that the Irish people not a certain number of criminals, but the whole Irish people had used no other weapon of political controversy than the murder of agents and landlords and the mutilation of cattle. Well, I tell the noble Marquess that if we had used no other weapon of political controversy than he stated he would not have been in power last year. He says that our Church the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland is a tremendous and grievously misused weapon. I say, in the face of the world, that the Church of the people of Ireland, in the face of unexampled difficulties, has merited the admiration of all honest men by the vigour, courage, and success with which it has endeavoured in times past of terrible trial, and under bitter provocation, and has also acted in preventing the people from indulgence in excess and in reprisals. What did he say to the Irish Members? He said the Representatives of the Irish people will swear what you like. I say nothing about ""swearing;"" we ""said"" what he liked last June, but we refused to ""say"" what he liked last January, and hence all this recrimination. Not  709 only does the noble Marquess deny us his confidence now, but he says he can never ask his countrymen to feel confidence in the Irish Representatives and the Irish people. If you can never feel confidence it follows necessarily that you can never give them Home Rule, and you must always coerce them. What did great experts say upon the subject of coercion? Lord Carnarvon said last year that coercion had become practically impossible. He said no sane man would propose to continue it. Did Lord Carnarvon cause a Commission of Inquiry to inquire into the sanity of his Leader? Lord Spencer also, one of the most competent living witnesses on the subject, has testified that you can no longer rely upon the coercion system of the past to rule Ireland. Does any hon. Gentleman here suppose himself as competent a witness as Lord Spencer? Is any hon. Gentleman here quite certain that if he had been placed in Lord Spencer's position he would have administered the drastic and terrible powers confided to him with the same pertinacity and courage as Lord Spencer? Sir, if I were an Englishman Lord Spencer's verdict would be final with me. I should regard him as the most competent witness, the only competent witness alive. And yet in the faces of these two Noblemen who last held the position of Viceroy of the Crown in Ireland the Marquess of Salisbury is prepared to resort to 20 years of coercion. Well, what kind of coercion must that be? Lord Canarvon told you last summer that summary powers of magistrates, secret inquisitions, changes of venue, and packed juries had not served their purpose; coercion at that time was played out. What must your new coercion be? You must go back to the time of Cromwell, and having gone back to him you must keep his company for at least a generation; and when the generation is over, will you be any nearer to success than you are at the present moment? No, Sir, because now you are near success. A plain way is opened to you by the guiding genius of the Prime Minister, and if you pursue it the end of trouble and the certainty of peace is at hand. The passion of nationality, the sentiment of race, the determination one day or another to control the internal affairs of Ireland, maintained through 700 years of suffering 710 and struggling, unparalleled in the history of the world, has become the Irishman's second nature. Law may satisfy it, but law can never expel it. Well, now, Sir, I come for a minute to the argument of the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Birmingham (Mr. J. Chamberlain). He has exposed on this and previous occasions what I may style his superficial knowledge of the subject under discussion by the remarks which he has made upon the mode of legislation in the Colonies as opposed to a system of federation. Perhaps if the right hon. Gentleman had obtained at the beginning of the Session the post which he is said to have desired that is, Secretary of State for the Colonies he might have learned a little more about the subject. He objects to the settlement proposed by the Prime Minister, because he says it proceeds on the lines of Colonial independence. How does it proceed on the lines of Colonial independence? Are the legislative powers of the Colonies specifically restricted? Have you in the case of any Colonial Legislature laid down the power of resumption? You have not. There is no comparison in principle between the settlement proposed for Ireland and the legislative system of, say, Cape Colony. The right hon. Gentleman favours a federal settlement. I do not know how far the public mind of Britain has advanced towards the goal. I do not know how far hon. Gentleman on this side of the House have reconciled themselves, for instance, to the establishment of six Legislatures in this country. Some people think that certain words of Mr. Burke are applicable to the argument used in a certain quarter of the House on this subject of federation  ""Hypocrisy delights in sublime speculations, for as it never intends to go beyond speculation it costs nothing to make it sublime."" Well, whether the adoption of federation be a near or distant date, I say that the effectuation of this settlement will not be a bar but will hasten rather than retard this settlement of the Irish Question. It may be a stepping stone to ultimate federation, because you can only enter into federation on the basis either of independent States or existing Local Legislatures. When the day comes that you desire Imperial Federation, then Ireland, by reason of her existing Local Legislature, will be  711 prepared to take her place as a member of such Federation. The right hon. Gentleman has returned to-day to the question of the retention of Irish Members in the Imperial Parliament. He has stated that the Irish Members are unfortunate in being misreported. But it was a very wonderful misreporting of his Sheffield speech. The passage which he says was misreported was distinguished by that felicity of metaphor which marks the style of the right hon. Gentleman. He said the pace of Parliament was not quick enough for him. He desired to see that pace accelerated for British Business, and said that the pace would never be accelerated so long as the Irish Members remained. The right hon. Gentleman, with that inaccuracy of mind which pervades the whole of his argument, misunderstood the point of Mr. Butt's scheme. Mr. Butt proposed to retain the Irish Members in this House. The right hon. Gentleman understood him to propose to exclude them, and on that basis the right hon. Gentleman argued that exclusion of the Irish Members was necessary in order to facilitate Business in this House. If the pace of Parliament was slow in 1874, what had it become since? It was at that time comparatively a dashing gallop. Since then it has slackened to a shuffling trot, and now, as regards English Business, it is almost at a complete standstill. Is the right hon. Gentleman opposite certain that if the Prime Minister had proposed to retain the Irish Members here, he would not have opposed this Bill upon that very ground that the pace af Parliament required to be accelerated by the exclusion of Irish Members and would have delivered a magnificent argument? In what plenitude of materials he would have revelled. He could point to the programmes of legislation of 1874 and 1880. He could call the attention of the country to the violent scenes and the all-night Sittings in this House, to the coup d'etat of Mr. Speaker Brand, to the censures and suspensions and expulsions of the Irish Members, to the abortive Rules of the Parliament of 1874, to the abortive Rules upon which you wasted an Autumn Session in 1882, to the current proceedings of the Select Committee on Procedure. He could have pointed to all this, and the right hon. Gentleman could have maintained and I state my candid opi- 712 nion that he would have maintained that the Bill of the Prime Minister was a fatal Bill, because it proposed to retain the Irish Members at Westminster. Sir, our position upon this question is reasonable and clear and plain. Our country has been so long misgoverned, she bas been so steadily and sadly neglected, her interests are so dislocated, her people so urgently require any skill that we can give, any industry and energy that we can apply, that we know that in an Irish Legislature our utmost energies for years to come should be devoted to the interests of our country. Till we get our own Parliament into something like good condition we cannot undertake further share in the management of your great estate of Great Britain. But, Sir, while we say this, we are willing to consider in a fair and candid spirit any proposal that can be made when the proper stage is reached for the retention of the Irish Members, and their due share in the transaction of Imperial affairs. But, Sir, I suspect the more than brotherly love of the right hon. Gentleman the Member for West Birmingham when he complained that if we were not to be retained in this House, it would be scandalous if we were taxed without being represented. The right hon. Gentleman the Prime Minister knows as much about taxation as anybody, and I think he will confirm me when I say that the representation of Ireland in this House, so far as taxation has been concerned, has been very much more nominal and technical than real representation. The presence of Irish Members here has never within my memory, except on one occasion, affected to the extent of 1d. the taxation of their country; and, therefore, when urgent interests call us home, can it be wondered that we attach no great importance to the principle of taxation with representation? The right hon. Gentleman proceeded to say we had a right to be heard upon questions affecting Imperial interests. But there is a difficulty in separating Imperial from British interests. Again, there is the difficulty pointed out by the Prime Minister himself to a Prime Minister having the confidence of Britain upon domestic questions and being thrown out by Irish votes upon an Imperial question. We see these difficulties. We do not at present see how to solve them. The Prime Minister has told us he will  713 present a plan, and we can only say on behalf of our people that we are prepared to give that plan the most fair and unprejudiced consideration; and I think when all is over it will be found that we have put no unreasonable obstacle in the way. But what was the true motive of the right hon. Gentleman (Mr. J. Chamberlain)? It was not to save us from being taxed without being represented. It was not to secure us our share in Imperial concerns. The real object of him who told us that if we accept this Bill it will degrade our country was to give us, not a Parliament, but a mock Assembly, the consideration of which would be an insult to the self-respect and a degradation of the Irish people. We accept the principle of this Bill, and I state most frankly that we ask to have one Body, and not more than one, for all Ireland, and not two Bodies for different parts of it. We ask to have a Legislature, not a Committee. We ask to have a lawmaking Body subject to the prerogatives of the Crown and the interpretation of the Constitutional tribunals subject, under certain conditions, to the authority of this Parliament. But we are not willing and will never accept any Assembly in Ireland which will be liable by system and as a matter of rule to have its proceedings reviewed and its will annulled by any other Legislature. We have heard a great deal about the abstract right of legislating for the Colonies. Well, Sir, I am not a Constitutional lawyer, or a lawyer of any kind. Indeed, although the lawyers who have spoken in favour of the Bill have been as numerous and as eminent as those who have spoken against it, I think the question before us is far more a question of common sense applied to practical life than of subtlety applied to law, and I think this House would have lost nothing if all the lawyers had been suspended from the service of the House till after the second reading. An abstract right, an inherent right, is one thing a specific provision is another. By this Bill certain powers are delegated to the Legislative Body in Ireland, and the method is defined by which at any moment the Imperial Parliament may resume them. Do not these two facts tell their own story? In my opinion, the case is made complete. To sum up the whole matter in 714 one word, I think the supremacy resides where power resides. If you insert a specific provision, what would be the consequences? If you say in the Bill, in a set form, that the Imperial Parliament shall or may interfere at any point with the proceedings of the Irish Parliament, you do not increase your inherent power by one jot or tittle. But what do you do? You do two things fatal to the Bill. In the minds of some persons you will preserve, in the minds of others you will cancel, the moral obligation which you admit to rest upon you not to interfere with the Irish Parliament without good and sufficient cause. It would be a different thing if Ireland were 3,000 miles away. If you insert a specific provision of this kind the effect will be that you will not satisfy Ireland; that you will not rid this Parliament of the endless trouble of the Irish Question; and you will have reached the last and most desperate stage of political combativeness the fighting of the Irish battles over again. The minority will come over from Ireland perhaps before they have exercised their veto, and ask Parliament to reverse the decision of the Irish House. The majority, of course, will follow them, and the majority and minority will fight their battles over again here, aided by amateurs and volunteers from both the British Parties. I beg to state, with every confidence, that the last state of the British Parliament will be worse than the first. Will any hon. Member, any practical man who has considered this question in the spirit of the politician and not of the theorist will any man tell me that the practical supremacy of this Parliament is not abundantly and sufficiently safeguarded? In the first place, you reserve to this Parliament any question connected with the Crown or the Empire; and no one has suggested that the long list of exceptions and reservations in this Bill requires to be extended. In the second place, if any Bill which has passed the Irish House, or any provision in any Act, appears to raise a Constitutional question, the Lord Lieutenant, in the case of a Bill: in the case of an Act, the Secretary of State, or any suitor or other person concerned; in the case of a section of a Bill, or provision of any Act, may bring that Bill or provision under the consideration of a body of English Judges or the Judicial Committee of  715 the Privy Council. Does anyone suggest that those Judges are likely to tamper with the Constitution? It would be a fantastic suggestion. But these Judges are themselves removable by an Address to the Crown, and thereby the supremacy of the Imperial Parliament is secured. But, then, it is said the Irish Judges may hold the Act to be right, and the English Judges that it is wrong. But in that case the decision of the Irish Judges would be liable to review in the Court of Appeal, and afterwards in the British House of Lords; and there, again, the supremacy of the British Parliament is safeguarded. Finally, Sir, if the Irish Legislature, even without exceeding its powers, passed an Act which in your opinion was contrary to public policy, what would happen? The minority could exercise its power and veto against the measure; and I must say on this point that never were a minority more tenderly dealt with than this minority of Ireland by the Prime Minister. You have one-twelfth of the elected Members, the 28 Irish Peers who may be reckoned to go solid against any popular demand, and these, with 24 other Members to fight with them, can stop the passage of any Bill for three years. Dean Swift once said that no man in his shirt could fight 11 men armed to the teeth; but one man in the Irish Parliament elected on the select franchise can defeat the will of 11 men elected by the people. I do not know what protection to minorities the right hon. Gentleman (Mr. J. Chamberlain) proposes in his scheme for National Councils. In the article of last year it was proposed that they should be one-third. The right hon. Gentleman the Prime Minister makes just the same proposal. There are the 28 Peers and the Ulster Members, besides which they will have the light, the intelligence, and the education of Ireland altogether on their side in the case of the fancy franchise, so that it is evident that in the Irish Assembly the minority will have one-third of the House. How such a minority can be said to be ""bound hand and foot"" to the majority I cannot understand, unless the Tory Party, which is one-third of the House, can be said to be ""bound hand and foot"" to the chariot of the right hon. Gentleman the Prime Minister. Well, this veto will stay the measure for three years, within 716 which it is possible for the Imperial Parliament to summon the Members of the Irish Parliament to Westminster for the purpose of altering or repealing the Act; and if the summons is not obeyed, the House at Westminster will have power to repeal the Act, or any of the Acts passed by the Irish Legislature. So that, whether the Irish Members come or go, you will have power to alter or repeal the Bill, and, of course, any acts done in virtue of the organic powers which have been performed. A more perfect, a more absolute, and more ingenious protection and preservation of the rights and interests of Great Britain than the Prime Minister has devised I cannot imagine. The right hon. Gentleman the Member for West Birmingham has not been afraid again to refer to the case of Ulster, with all the familiar epithets attached to it prosperous Ulster, Protestant Ulster, loyal Ulster. As to the first epithet, prosperous, I suppose he was misled by the right hon. Gentleman the Member for East Edinburgh (Mr. Goschen), in whose opposition to this Bill I may say we rejoice. The right hon. Gentleman has always been the enemy of any measure for extending popular liberties in England as well as in Ireland; and it appears to me that the right hon. Gentleman is under the impression that Providence has permitted the common class of people to increase and multiply in order to provide a sphere for the exercise of the political talent of gentlemen of assured gentility and elegant education. I rejoice for two reasons that he has been found opposing this Bill in the first place, because everything he opposes is bound to win; and, in the second place, if he were unfortunately found in the attitude of supporting the Bill I should find myself under the painful necessity of considering whether I ought not to oppose it. The right hon. Gentleman took four counties, including the great town of Belfast and other towns, and referred to Schedule D of the Income Tax, dealing with the profits of trades, professions, and urban pursuits, and compared that with the half of Ulster which has none. He made out that Loyal Ulster was several times more wealthy than Nationalist Ulster. Well, Loyal Ulster bears in income to National Ulster the proportion of three to two. No doubt, what is  717 called Loyal Ulster is more prosperous than the other parts of that Province, but the fact is not owing to its loyalty, but to its being on the Eastern side of the country, which is throughout the most fertile and consequently the richest. That relation is not peculiar to Ulster, because all round the rest of Ireland you will find the East is better than the West, the soil being more productive and the natural advantages greater. But Ulster upon the Income Tax assessment per head is but little more than half of Leinster upon the rateable value of property per head, and is far under Leinster. In each of these respects it is only superior to Connaught, the poorest and most neglected Province. It has the largest number of poor cabins; and Munster largely exceeds it in houses of the better class. Judged by the test of emigration, and ignorance, too, it is incredible that any claim should be put forward on behalf of Ulster. Unexpected results are disclosed by Ulster, for during the last few years the emigration has been greatest from that Province, and the ignorance is densest. If a part of Ulster is prosperous, to what is it due? Not to any cause of political history, not to any cause of race or creed, but to the fact that it was the policy of England to protect Ulster by giving Ulster custom; while you crushed out of existence manufacturing industry of Ireland in every other place, you fostered it and nourished it in Ulster. Since the passing of the Land Act that superiority has gone, and the other Provinces are gaining on the Northern one. Nor is the claim to what is called ""loyalty"" less unfounded. The Representatives of Ulster in that House show that the majority of the people of that Province are not loyal, or, as I prefer to term it, disloyal to the national cause. We hear of Protestant Ulster. Ulster is no more Protestant than the rest of Ireland. Leave out Belfast and at the date of the last Census the Catholics had a majority of 100,000 over the whole Province. Even including the city of Belfast the Protestants have only a majority of 70,000. Well, since the date of the last Census the emigration of Catholics from Ulster has fallen off because of the security afforded by the Land Act, whilst the emigration of the Protestants has greatly increased, especially to British North America; 718 and if the Census could be taken tomorrow I venture to say it would be found that the Catholics are in an absolute majority. Then, what is the meaning of this talk about Protestant Ulster? We are told that it is Loyal Ulster. I say that if loyal means opposed to the national classes of Ireland Ulster is not loyal. The majority of the Members from the Province of Ulster sit below and not above the Gangway, and in proportion as you increase the Members for Ulster so in proportion you increase the national majority. What comfort would it be to the hon. and gallant Member for North Armagh (Major Saunderson) to find himself a Member of an Ulster Assembly in which the place and power of the Prime Minister were held by my hon. Friend the Member for Cavan (Mr. Biggar)? The Ulster Tory Members do not want a separate Parliament for Ulster. The hon. and gallant Member has never asked for it, for very good reasons. In the first place, he and his Party would be in a minority in it. And the plan of the right hon. Gentleman the Member for West Birmingham would certainly place the Protestant minority of Ulster in a very disadvantageous position. The small Provincial Assembly would be uninfluenced by any national feeling. It would be uncontrolled by the presence of men trained to toleration by the experience of a wider sphere, and power would be placed in the hands of men who would be sure to use it harshly. The second reason is that the hon. and gallant Gentleman would be denounced by the whole of the civilized world as a dastard if he desorted the 300,000 Protestants scattered throughout the South and West of Ireland. These 300,000 are in the midst of a Catholic population of 3,000,000. They would never exercise a vote, they would never have a single Member in Parliament, they could not form a constituency anywhere, they would be absolutely dumb in the hands of the Legislature. Is that the protection of the minority which the right hon. Member for West Birmingham is so anxious for? Why, Sir, I will follow him as far as he likes. Take the most limited district of Ulster. In the Western part the Catholics are as 3 to 1, in the central region they are in an absolute majority. The only part in which the Protestants are in the majority is the part which  719 comprises the county of Antrim and certain portions of Armagh and Down. Would the House consent to break up an English settlement for the sake of a district comprising Northumberland, Durham, and the North Riding of Yorkshire? Even within that limited district is there no minority? Why, Sir, there are 500,000 Protestants and 200,000 Catholics, so that if the right hon. Gentleman (Mr. J. Chamberlain) who, if he had carried out his contemplated visit to Ireland last autumn would have known a little more about it proposes this way of protecting minorities, I must tell him that the Prime Minister is much more considerate than he is, and the minorities themselves would very soon acknowledge it. If the plan of the right hon. Gentleman was carried out you would have not one but two oppressed minorities. You would have the 200,000 Catholics and the 500,000 Protestants in the North of Ireland, and the 3,000,000 Catholics and the 300,000 Protestants in the other Provinces, so that in order to please 500,000 people, or the men who are supposed to represent them, you will outrage the feelings of 200,000 Catholics and 300,000 Protestants. If you care to pursue the fantastic theory of the right hon. Gentleman down to the point of Parish Parliament, you would not solve the question, because the Catholic population so interpenetrates every portion of Ulster that even if you had a Parliament in every parish you would still have a minority in each. There is no safe standing ground except to treat Ireland as a unit, and the demand of Ireland as the demand of the people of Ireland. I cannot too solemnly protest against the language of the right hon. Gentleman with regard to the Catholic Church. The spirit of aggression is as foreign to the genius of the Catholic Church as it is to the principles of modern enlightenment. Can the right hon. Gentleman point to any country in the world where Catholics are in the majority and where they oppress, persecute, or disturb in any way whatever the freedom of religion of their Protestant fellow-subjects? It is not done in France, it is not done in Italy? [An hon. MEMBER: How about Spain?] No, nor in Spain. The Protestants are as free in the City of Rome as in any city of the world. Is it done in the South 720 American Republics? There the Governments are the least stable, and the condition of society is the most precarious, and yet there the civil and religious liberties of Protestants are unquestioned. There was a time when the Catholics of Ireland might, if they wished, have oppressed the Protestants that was a time when the principles of toleration did not prevail as they do now; and yet I challenge any hon. Member of this House to look through the records of that Parliament of James II., formed as it was of Irish Catholic Gentlemen, and who had suffered long and grievously at the hands of Protestants, and find a single act or a single word in reference to the doctrine of toleration and equality of creeds which might not be now adopted to the honour of any of the most enlightened communities of to-day. I cast back, therefore, upon the right hon. Gentleman the imputation he has made, and I say that what I know to be true of myself, and believe to be true of my countrymen what I know to be true of myself I solemnly declare is this that so far from having felt the feeling of religious bigotry, I have never been able even to understand it. I believe that every peasant in Ireland has for that base and detestable sentiment the same strong feeling; and when intriguing politicians talk to us about the danger of establishing the Roman Catholic Church, although there are ample precautions against ecclesiastical supremacy in the Bill, still, if there were no precautions, I say that the Catholic Church in Ireland rests, and will rest, as all other Churches rest, on the moral strength which belong to it by the value of its work and the preciousness of its ministrations to the people. I would invite the right hon. Gentleman to look to our Protestant Leader. When he was attacked in high ecclesiastical quarters, and when an effort was made by base and disreputable intrigues to level against him the supreme authority of the Catholic Church, and when it appeared for a moment as if that supreme authority were about to be exercised in his case, history records that the Catholic people of Ireland, devoted to their Church and devoted to their country, and the Catholic priests of Ireland, devoted to their Church and to their country, but having in their  721 mind a clear and fixed distinction between the spheres of religious duty and that of political liberty, never in one moment wavered their devotion to their Protestant Leader. Well, Sir, we have to deal not only with the critics of this measure, but with the prophets of evil. The former have attributed to the voluntary establishment of a mode of union between the two countries all the follies and all the calamities that could follow from the most bloody revolution. On the other hand, the prophets of evil have declared that the future Irish Parliament will be guilty of all the follies that could be attributed to men who are a compound of knaves and lunatics I will not say lunatics, because if you admit a lunatic's premises you will generally find that his conclusions are just. I will rather say imbecile, for he is wrong and silly all through. It is said that this Bill leads to separation. A shell might almost be thrown from Holyhead to Kingstown; a telegram would bring troops and ships to the cities of Ireland in a day; your barracks, your forts, and your magazines are already in the country. When I hear this argument from Englishmen, I confess that, as an Irishman, I can only feel wonderment; but if I were an Englishman, conscious proudly conscious of what the energy of my race had done in making this Island one of the foremost nations in the world, in carrying its commerce and flag to the uttermost ends of the earth, and in maintaining up to this moment the commercial empire of the seas if, I say, I was an Englishman conscious of the qualities of my race, I should resent as an injury and an insult the offering of any such argument to the British nation. No; the Irish people have suffered too bitterly and too long to play any idle tricks, and the House may rest assured that when they obtain their Parliament they will choose the most competent men in Ireland for the conduct of its affairs, and that those affairs will be conducted with wisdom, dignity, and good faith. There are guarantees in the Bill, and there are guarantees out of it. The two real guarantees for the maintenance of the Empire are physical force and the free consent of the people. The possession of physical force will remain with England. The free consent of the people of Ireland rests upon their 722 interest and their affections. Their interest will be bound to you by this measure of political freedom, and their affection is sure to follow. I say, therefore, that with regard to the two permanent bases of the security of the Empire that one of them remains in undiminished force and the other will be increased. Talk about the Viceroy and the Crown. Two years ago I saw Lord Spencer pass my window in the City of Dublin. He galloped by, casting frightened glances from side to side, surrounded by a body of Guards with drawn swords in their hands. He galloped through like a General in an enemy's country. I mentioned the name of Lord Spencer, and I say there never was an Administration that will be spoken of with such bated breath by the fireside of every man in Ireland as his. But the Irish people know how to forgive and to forget. I say a light has been shed upon the character of Lord Spencer by his magnanimous conduct on this question. His conduct sheds honour upon the name of Englishmen. The Irish people perceive his constancy in trying one course, and, finding that failed, adopting another. If Lord Spencer returned to Ireland to-morrow his bodyguard would be, not the Dragoons of the British Army, but the cheering multitude of the Loyal majority of Ireland. [Cheers.] The hon. and gallant Member for North Armagh cheers that statement. [Major SAUNDERSON: No, no!] I thought I distinguished a disapproving sound from the vicinity of the hon. and gallant Member. I am willing to say that I think the disloyal minority would keep away. The other day Lord Aberdeen made a progress through the South of Ireland. He went as the Viceroy of the Queen and as the Colleague of the right hon. Gentleman the Prime Minister. He was met at Kenmare by a Protestant rector and by a Catholic priest, and each of them presented an address on behalf of his congregation, and each of those addresses testified to the full belief of the people that the settlement proposed by the right hon. Gentleman would not only be accepted by the people of Ireland, but that it would be found to work out hereafter the pacification and contentment of that country. The National League band went to the railway station and met Lord Aberdeen; and what airs do you  723 think they played? They played ""God Save the Queen"" and then they played ""God Save Ireland;"" and His Excellency very aptly and very justly remarked that he rejoiced at the new and promising combination between nationality and loyalty. I am bound to say that I read in the papers that they played ""God Save the Queen"" rather badly; it was an air at which they had had not much particular practice; and, in fact, there is a report that these energetic musicians stayed up all night in order to learn it. We can scarcely wonder at it, for the last time ""God Save the King"" was heard in Kenmare was in the year 1795, and the coincidence is instructive, for in that year Lord Fitzwilliam, a former messenger of peace to Ireland a former messenger, whose mission, by unfortunate and miserable intrigues and by base passions, proved abortive paid his visit to Kenmare. I hope the present mission may prove more successful. Before I sit down I must protest with all my force against the insinuation which has been made that we have put our case before the people of Britain accompanied by any threats or by any menaces. We have stood out of this controversy; we have allowed it to be freely discussed between the British people and their Leaders. If we intervene even at the present stage it is because it is no longer possible for us to be silent it is because it is now essential that our views and opinions should be known. The people of Ireland have suffered bitterly in the past. They are now passing through a time of terrible trial, and I claim from men of all Parties in this House the admission that the Irish people are behaving with the most remarkable patience. The threats do not come from us. The threats come from the ""Loyal minority."" The threats come from those who have never been loyal to you from those who have never been loyal to anything but to their own selfish interest and their own sordid gain. They now threaten to be disloyal to you and traitors to the Throne unless you allow them to keep their feet where their feet have been for so long upon the necks of the Irish people. I do not know where the right hon. Member for West Birmingham found the growing determination on the part of Ulster to resist this Bill. Did he find it in the form of the Protestant Home Rule Association 724 of Belfast? Did he find it in the address of 500 leading Protestants of Ulster recently presented to the Prime Minister congratulating him on his policy and hoping for its success? Did he find it in advertisements in the Press informing the police where they could find the Snider rifles, or did he find it in the Orange triumvirate above the Gangway? With regard to the hon. and gallant Member for North Down (Colonel Waring), with his threat of war, there seems to be a tone of Don Quixote in his character something more pathetic than formidable. I do not apprehend any danger from the hon. and gallant Gentleman, nor from the hon. Member for South Belfast (Mr. Johnston). The hon. Member for South Belfast rushed from a meeting of his supporters the other day with the exclamation ""I am going to London to stop Mr. Morley's Arms Bill?"" Well, he came to London, he saw the Bill, and he was conquered, and he has since been denounced for his recreancy by the Tory organ in Ulster, because, instead of defeating the right hon. Gentleman's Bill, he walked into the Lobby with the Government as neatly as ever a ewe followed a bellwether through a hedge. The hon. Member seems to be under the impression that the British Army will not fight him. I never heard that the British Army especially the 30,000 Catholic soldiers in the ranks had transferred their allegiance from Her Majesty Queen Victoria to King William of Ballykilbeg. That Monarch may be excellent in many respects, but he labours under two disqualifications he has no commissariat and he has no exchequer. Without these two qualifications it is quite impossible to keep any army in the field. The hon. Gentleman threatens that he will go through the land with the Bible in one hand and the sword in the other. [An hon. MEMBER: The rifle] yes; with the Bible in one hand and the rifle in the other. That is an old tableau it has not the merit of novelty and I must say that, aware as I am that the hon. Gentleman has devoted the vigour of his career to peaceful piscatorial pursuits, I fear that he may do some harm to others with his Bible and some injury to himself with his rifle. But seriously, Sir, I think that the hon. Gentleman at his time of life would do well to consider whether even the enthu-  725 siastic sons of King William, when he makes his heroic speeches, are not thinking in their own secret hearts that he would fill an arm-chair much better than line a ditch. Probably, Sir, most of them suspect that a night-cap would come more readily to his hand than the rifle. But the chief of the triumvirate is the hon. and gallant Member for North Armagh (Major Saunderson). He differs a good deal from the hon. Member for South Belfast (Mr. Johnston), who is the dupe of his own imagination. The hon. and gallant Member for North Armagh sees through himself quite clearly, and it is not this kind of a Paladin that the British Army would be afraid of. What he relies on is the credulity of the British people. I can shed some light on the method of the hon. and gallant Gentleman, for lately in a speech in Ireland he said  ""I have had an opportunity of speaking at Chester and at Plymouth, and I have spoken in other places. I invariably saw this that there was nothing which elicited their enthusiasm so much as when I told them that the Ulster men were ready to strike at the proper time for their defence. I intend to repeat that again and again. I said distinctly in the House of Commons that our right arms shall shrivel before we consent to be ruled by Parnell. The rest will follow as a matter of course."" I should be sorry to see anything occur to mar the statuesque appearance and martial vigour of the hon. and gallant Gentleman; but I cannot help thinking that perhaps in view of such a contingency the best service his right arm could fulfil would be to shrivel, as otherwise he may be compelled to break his word or else get himself into serious trouble. But the hon. and gallant Gentleman conducts his operations on a system, and he has explained to his friends how he does it. He has told them that if he attacked his opponents directly, you, Sir, would call him to Order. ""There are Parliamentary objections,"" he said, ""to calling a spade a spade."" And then with some ingenuity I discovered the method of what may be called vicarious vituperation. Well, Sir, we are thankful to the hon. and gallant Gentleman for the hint. I know some quotations which would greatly entertain the House, and the hon. and gallant Gentleman says  ""I am happy to say you may call a man anything if it is only in a quotation."" I have no doubt, Mr. Speaker, that you 726 will feel yourself indebted to me for enabling you to appreciate the spirit of the hon. and gallant Gentleman's speeches in future debates in this House. But the point of my revelation of the system of the hon. and gallant Gentleman is this that an hon. and gallant Gentleman, who, when he desires to attack his fellow-Members, does not do it on his own responsibility, but throws a shield of inverted commas between himself and the epithet, is not in my opinion the kind of man who in any emergency would face the British or any other Army. The only importance these threats have acquired has been derived from the patronage which they have received. The local inciters to disorder in Ulster are what an able journal opposed to this Bill described them ""mere fire eaters and feather heads,"" with this exception, that while the fire they consume is imaginary the feathers in their head are real. The noble Lord the Member for Paddington (Lord Randolph Churchill) tells Ulster men that ""by Heavens, their privileges are worth fighting for."" When he asks them whether they are as good men as their forefathers in 1798 he awakens all the memories of horror and outrage and ruin inflicted upon a helpless and defenceless people, and in urging Ulster to charge with all its chivalry revives memories which set men's blood in flame. It is then that the conduct of hon. Gentlemen who are playing a game of ""bluff,"" and of dependence upon the credulity of the people, acquires a seriousness not its own. Lord Salisbury, when the hon. and gallant Gentleman (Major Saunderson) at St. James's Hall repeated the dire threats about the shrivelling of his right arm, was so struck with the conclusiveness of the argument that he said to attempt to add force to it would be like trying to paint the lily. Lord Salisbury does not stick at a trifle, but he will not try to paint the Orange lily. He does not know this particular lily as well as we do. This particular lily stands in no need of painting. It is able to change colour of itself. It was buff once; it is orange now, and some day or other it will be green. The right hon. Gentleman the Member for West Birmingham has placed himself in alliance with the Heads of the Tory Party in inciting a certain section of the Protestants of Ulster to the resistance of the law. He  727 has told them that if they are ""really in earnest"" they are certain to have their way. What does he mean by being ""really in earnest?"" I think the terms are plain enough. He used these threats at a time when threats were hurtling through the air, and we heard of armed bodies of Orangemen and of the despatch of Snider rifles. Does the right hon. Gentleman expect us to believe that when he asks an excited body of factionaries in Ulster to prove that they are really in earnest he means anything else than that the will of this Parliament and the authority of the Crown should be defied by force of arms? What otherwise can he mean? The will of the men of Ulster upon this Irish question will not be traversed until the Irish Parliament comes into existence and endeavours to assert its authority; and if the men of Ulster at that stage accept the advice of the right hon. Gentleman, they will be in the position of manifest traitors to the Crown, and I do not see what can save them and the Heads of the Tory Party from the taint of constructive treason. I think, Sir, it is time that the Oath of a Privy Councillor should be read at the Table of this House. I think it is time that this House should consider the advisability of presenting an Address to the Crown inviting Her Gracious Majesty to revise the list of Privy Councillors. They talk of threats if you pass this Bill. Sir, if you pass this Bill you will have overruled these threats of the turbulent and violent minority, devoid of political power and influence in Ireland. If you fail to pass this Bill, you will have yielded to the threats of that minority. Ireland will hold it so. The Irish people all over the world will believe it, and I beg the House to remember how fatal a lesson it would be to leave it on record that, after having used the scaffold and the penal cell from generation to generation, Irishmen who merely asked the right that you now say should be conceded were refused the concession of that national right, because a faction of the people of Ireland who were never loyal to anything except their own passions and selfishness threatened to rise against you. Sir, guarantees have been spoken of the guarantee that this House has for the future of Ireland is one that cannot be questioned the 728 great guarantee is the gratitude of the people of Ireland to the Prime Minister. He has not yet succeeded; but we are grateful to him for the intention and the desire as if success were already in his hands. Moreover, that we are grateful to him deeply grateful to him for having in the presence of mean and unworthy attacks upon ourselves and our people declared in the face of England and the world his confidence in us and in them. We shall never abuse that confidence. It is not a half-confidence that we in return offer the right hon. Gentleman the Prime Minister. We appreciate the difficulties that surround him. We estimate the forces by which he is beset. We had hoped that it might have been possible for him a few days ago to have pressed forward the Bill this Session; but, reviewing in my own mind all the forces opposed to him and the character of the tactics sure to be pursued with reference to the matter, I thought and believed that after carefully reviewing the three courses indicated by him at the Foreign Office, that he announced the course most likely to defeat obstructive tactics, and accomplish a generous policy for Ireland. He has told us that he will press on this Bill, and that he anticipates at present no material amendment except with regard to that portion referring to the retention of Irish Members. For my own part, I am not sorry that the enmity to the Prime Minister and his Bill at the present moment has unequivocally expressed itself. The grievance of the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Birmingham is not against the Prime Minister and his Bill; his grievance is that he is not Prime Minister of England at the present moment. He is the victim of a precocious ambition. He sat for some time on the box of the Liberal coach; not like the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Edinburgh (Mr. Goschen), who was tied behind it, and who has made his progress in that reluctant manner, kicking and shouting every inch of the way. No, Sir. The right hon. Gentleman the Member for Birmingham sat on the box, but he made a slight mistake as to his position there. Now, while he did not drive the coach, but only sat on the box beside the driver, still sometimes he wished to take the reins, to apply the whip, to put on the drag, sometimes to pull up, sometimes  729 to turn aside, sometimes to regulate the pace. But, the driver, on the other hand, who had made several journeys, and had never had any serious mishap, naturally desired to regulate the pace himself. I have no doubt that the country will agree that the driver was perfectly right in his determination to do so. The right hon. Member for Birmingham not being able to regulate the pace, he wished to upset the coach. Well, the coach may be upset, but it can be set up again, and what then will become of the worthy who pulled out the lynch-pin? I think it is no evil, if the struggle is to come, that the fight shall begin at the first barricade, and the sooner the fight begins the sooner it will be ended. Sir, we have confidence in this House. This House is the firstborn of the Democracy of Great Britain. I have always believed and I still refuse to believe the contrary that the House will be true to its origin. If it should not be so there is, happily, an appeal. We look with confidence to the appeal from this House to the country, if it is necessary. The people of England were never responsible for the shame and the guilt of misgovernment of Ireland. It was the national shame, but it never was their shame. They were misled and misinformed by a cunning Government class and by an unscrupulous Press. Now, for the first time, the people of England know the truth, and they have been told that truth with an eloquence, and a comprehensiveness, and a force that no other living man could approach. At the time of the Union only a fraction of the people had been within the pale of the Constitution; but now for the first time they know the truth, for the first time they have the power, and although the right hon. Member for East Edinburgh (Mr. Goschen), and his kind would have kept millions of Englishmen out of the franchise if they could, though they appeal to the country against the Prime Minisster, I believe the appeal to England, to the men to whom the Prime Minister gave political force, will result in their using that political force in the name of justice, and that the right hon. Gentleman will be supported by a force that will be irresistible. Sir, this is a struggle between a giant and a throng of liliputians. The time is against the pigmies. They may press in upon that 730 point, they may beset him sore, but he can call out his reserves. The liliputians succeeded in binding a countryman of the right hon. Gentleman one named Gulliver they bound him with very slender pack thread, but they did it because they caught him asleep. Now, I have observed the right hon. Gentleman the Prime Minister for some years, and I have noticed that in the course of a long Sitting he has sometimes appeared to slumber in his place; but if any hon. Gentleman tries no matter how obscure the Member to refer to Bulgaria or Mid Lothian, or even Kilmainham, the right hon. Gentleman immediately opened one of his eyes, keeping the other, I presume, in reserve for emergencies. From that I gather that to catch the right hon. Gentleman asleep in public matters is not by any means easy. All the right hon. Gentleman has to do in this struggle is to keep wide awake the Bill will be secure, and England will enable him to win. The noble Marquess the Member for Rossendale said that the Bill was dead. Sir, the Bill is not dead. The Bill is alive, and it will live; it will thrive in the hands of a living Irish nation. But I will tell the noble Marquess what is dead his Party is dead. His Party is one of husks shed by the Liberal Party, and these husks are represented by territorial Whigs and sham Radicals. The Marquess of Salisbury took upon himself to state that in a few days this Bill would be a matter of history it will be a matter of history, but it will be a history of one chapter closed and another opened it will be a history of a chapter that records the end of a chapter which lasted 700 years a chapter unequalled in misery and in shame, a chapter of tyranny, retaliation, and of persecution. It will mark the opening of a better and a happier chapter of a chapter to last, I hope, through the ages yet to come a chapter of justice and of mutual kindliness a chapter of prosperity and peace. Sir, I believe that in the Hall of the Irish Legislative Chamber opposite the statue of Charles James Fox that one great Englishman, before our time, who had the wisdom and the greatness to appreciate the justice of the Irish cause, will stand the statue of the right hon. Gentleman the Prime Minister. We who will have remembered him in his greatness we who have seen him and heard him will know how he  731 feared nothing, how he dared everything where his head and conscience led him to champion the Irish cause. His memory will be a beneficent influence to the future time. History, the impartial justifier of right, will, when the passions of this struggle are stilled, when everyone of us is lying quiet in our grave, cherish his memory as one who brought to an end the woful and bitter fight between two nobly-gifted nations the struggle between the English and the Irish people and generations of Englishmen and of Irishmen yet unborn will bless his memory as that of him who initiated and achieved between Great Britain and Ireland a settlement sought for by this Empire, beneficial to Great Britain, satisfying to Ireland, and honourable to both our nations."	221.0	1886.0	1880	[('great', 'great', ['positive', 'JJ']), ('great', 'great', ['positive', 'JJ']), ('right', 'right', ['positive', 'JJ']), ('little', 'little', ['negative', 'JJ']), ('right',

756675	756675	S4V0037P0-05796	1896-03-02	SUPPLY (NAVY ESTIMATES).	THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY (Mr. G. J. GOSCHEN, St. George's,	Hanover Square	"THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY (Mr. G. J. GOSCHEN, St. George's, Hanover Square) who was received with cheers, said: My first duty is to thank the House for accepting without demur the suggestion that I should make my annual statement on the Navy before you, Mr. Speaker, leave the Chair. I promise that I will not abuse the privilege by any inordinate length of speech, and I shall not make a statement of such proportions as have been assigned to it by anticipation in some quarters of the House. I wish to approach the business part of my statement at once, and will therefore make but few preliminary observations. I hope I may be relieved of any necessity of dwelling upon what is called the critical nature of the times. These are sober Estimates which we are going to propose. We hope that they will be accepted by the country as adequate to the occasion. They are not proposed with any feeling of alarm. [""Hear, hear!""] The only other preliminary observation I would make is to remind the House of the truism, the truism 1500 which is often ignored, that any increase in the Fleet means not only an increase in the number of ships, but must be followed all along the line of Naval preparation by expenditure in various directions. [Cheers.] More ships mean more men to man them, more officers, more seamen, more marines, more engineers, more stokers, more ratings of every kind. And more men and more officers mean more centres of training, more accommodation both on shore and at sea, more schools, more hospital accommodation, and more barrack accommodation; and, therefore, it must be well borne in mind that when an increase in the Fleet is suggested it would be unwise to act simply in one direction. A general survey must be taken of the whole situation, and the corresponding increases must be made where they are necessary. Excessive increase in any one direction would be useless unless it were followed by increases in other directions. [Cheers.] I would enforce that view by stating that now the situation is changed as regards the completion of warships. In old days the building of a warship took four or five years. Then it was necessary to look far in advance, and overtake the building of those ships in respect of men and mighty guns. Now the rapidity of shipbuilding has become such that you can build ships as rapidly as you can construct the large guns that are to be put into them, or train the officers and men who are to manage those ships when they are completed. For instance, a new 12-in. wire gun contains 108 miles of wire. The result is that if we were to push on with our ships more rapidly than the producing power of the country will supply us with armour and armaments, we should have our ships ready for sea but not be able to send them to sea. A further feature in the situation is this, that we train almost every class of men whom we put into our ships. We do not take seamen from the mercantile marine except in very small numbers; and now we train our engineers and stokers, as well as our seamen. Stokers are entered young; they are sent to the various ports; they are drilled as seamen are drilled for a certain number of months; and in that way we get a higher class, a more disciplined class, and a more useful class  1501 than we should otherwise be able to obtain. [""Hear, hear!""] But the House must bear in mind the enormous complexity of our armaments. That is a difficulty which must induce us to pay the highest attention to every form of training, to engineering schools, to gunnery schools, and to our naval shipbuilding schools, because these great modern machines are such that the ordinary seaman who was the gunner of the past would certainly not be able to find his way about. [""Hear, hear!""] In the scheme I am about to lay before the House we have not been looking to an increase in one direction only, but we have endeavoured, I can assure the House, to face the great requirements of the Navy in every department, and I may say, in every part of the world. [Cheers.] We have tried to look at this matter as a whole, and the result of that examination, as it stands, I will now proceed to lay before the House. I will, in the first place, deal with the personnel of the Navy, and here I should wish at starting to be allowed to dispel a fallacy which is very prevalent in many quarters namely, that we have a difficulty in obtaining sufficient men for the Navy. [Cheers.] That view is only held by those who are not acquainted with the actual circumstances, but still it is a very general fallacy, and I have received sometimes touching letters from local authorities and from individuals, offering their services to the country on account of the alleged scarcity of men and difficulty of recruiting for our services. That difficulty does not exist. [Cheers.] On the contrary, I am able to make a satisfactory statement to the House on that point. [""Hear, hear!""] Of course we cannot recruit trained men because it is a special service for which we require them, and therefore we must take them early and train them ourselves. But, as regards the number of men which we can secure by accepting the offers of those who present themselves, we are in an entirely satisfactory position. [Cheers.] When we enlist 3,000 boys for the Navy we take 1 in 10 of the applicants, and the numbers of eligible candidates have been such that we have been able to make a strict selection and to increase the standard and the chest measurement of the boys. The same holds good as regards the stokers. We are now able to secure the number of 1502 stokers we desire, and we are training them at the present moment in great numbers. Well, now, with regard to numbers, right hon. Gentlemen opposite are aware, and the House must be aware, that the Admiralty has proceeded not in any haphazard way in order to see how much we can afford to spend on men next year; but for some time past there has been a Manning Committee sitting, and they have examined every ship ready and every ship in course of construction, and have made their plans in advance, calculating what number of seamen, marines and stokers is necessary to man the increased number of ships that we are going to send afloat. Last year the increase in the total number of men was 5,450. I propose to ask the House to sanction an increase of 4,900 to the personnel. We wish to add 1,800 to the seamen class, slightly more than 2,000 to the engine-room ratings, 342 to the artisan class, and 500 to that most useful and valuable force, the Marines. To show what progress has been made with regard to numbers, I will give the House a few figures. Upon the active list there were ten years ago 61,400 men. In 1895 there were 88,850, and, as I have said, the number is now to be increased by 4,900. The Reserve has been increased in the same time from 18,300 to 25,100. One method by which we have recruited for the Service is by the cruise of the Northampton, a ship set aside to visit various ports along the coast and to enter directly a certain number of boys of an older age than usual. That is a system which can only be adopted very tentatively and with care, but we have received reports from the Commanders of the ships in the Mediterranean Squadron, and without exception they speak most favourably of the conduct of these boys. [""Hear, hear!""] There is apparently one deficiency, and that is that only a few of them can swim. Apart from that, they have been extremely well reported upon. We are now going to increase the sources of supply by a method which occupied the attention of the House last year namely, by the agency of a training-ship, which is to be sent to Queenstown. For this service we have selected the Black Prince, one of the finest ships that could be devoted to such a purpose. In the case of the Marines the recruiting has also  1503 been most satisfactory; and here, again, during the last few months, we have been able to raise the standard. I call particular attention to this, as it shows that, both in the case of seamen and Marines, we have a large selection from the youthful population of the country. I may mention that we are arming the batteries, where the Marines are trained with the latest type of marine guns. I stated at the opening of my remarks that there must be consequential expense upon the increase of the Fleet. For example, the number of men being increased, we are bound to provide more hospital accommodation. The accommodation at Chatham is at present insufficient and inadequate, as is also the barrack accommodation. We shall have to propose expenditure under these two heads as well as for further school facilities. I think the House will be prepared to regard such expenditure as capital expenditure, and to add it to the Naval Works Programme initiated by the last Government. I will say nothing now with regard to the Royal Naval Reserve, which is in a satisfactory position, but for information on this subject, I may refer hon. Members to the printed statement which will explain the Estimates, and which will be in the hands of Members to-morrow morning, if not this evening. I wish to say a word or two with regard to the position if warrant officers. We have been able to come to certain conclusions affecting their prospects and condition. The list of chief gunners, chief boatswains, chief carpenters and warrant officers will be further increased to meet the extension of the Fleet, thus giving a certain amount of promotion. That increase will be accompanied by a revision of the rules governing their pay, promotion, and training. The chief gunners, chief boatswains and chief carpenters will get an improved scale of pay, ranging from 10s. to 12s. a day, and warrant officers will get from 5s. 6d. to 9s. a day, besides increased store and certain other allowances. Pensions and compassionate allowances to widows and children of officers who retire with the rank of honorary lieutenant will be on the same scale as those granted in the case of junior lieutenants. We trust that this will meet the wishes, to a certain extent, of a body of officers whom the 1504 nation values highly, and in whom it takes a legitimate pride. [""Hear, hear!""] I am able to say also that the training of engineer students in the college at Keyham is progressing in a most satisfactory manner. Two members of the Board visited that college not long ago, and they were struck by the general appearance and aptitude of these young recruits to Her Majesty's service. The profession of engineers in the Royal Navy is a fine profession, and the men who enter it now come from all classes of society. They have, when they enter the profession, a certain professional career. They have that advantage over civil engineers. Having once entered the service they are sure of being on full pay until they retire, there being practically no half-pay in their case, as there is in the case of the active list. The prospects of engineer students, who are to mess with gun-room and ward-room officers, are not generally known in the country, yet the number of applicants is such as to meet the necessary requirements of the service. Now I pass to the executive officers. The House will remember that an experiment was made last year, when it was determined that 100 officers should be entered from the Mercantile Marine. The plan was very much criticised at the time, and some hard things, which I regretted, were said with regard to Mercantile Marine officers. It was suggested that there would be difficulty on board ship, and that we should not get the right sort of men. Well, according to the information which we have received from the officers under whom these men are serving, there has been no friction, and they have proved themselves to be a most excellent addition to our Naval Service. [Cheers.] Ninety of these officers were taken from the Royal Naval Reserve; two were taken from the Victorian Naval Defence Force; and eight were taken from the Mercantile Marine direct. There were several hundreds of applicants, and we have a supplementary list. The gaps caused by the plan in the ranks of the Royal Naval Reserve have been at once filled up, 264 young men having sent in their names for enrolment in that service. A great many of these officers, I should add, have had a year's training, and some of them two years' training,  1505 on board a man-of-war. This plan, however, we still regard as a temporary expedient, and we shall look in the future as in the past to a system of education such as has been hitherto carried on in the Britannia o prepare the officers of our fleet. There is no subject which has more exercised my mind than the question of the supply of young officers. It is a matter of paramount importance, and I am not prepared to say that I consider the present system as entirely satisfactory. I think we draw our boys possibly from too small an area. Whether the Civil Service Commissioners have been unable to defeat the efforts of crammers or whether the crammers have improved upon their system I do not know; but certainly the main idea of parents still is that their boys must be sent to cramming schools, before they can expect to pass the entrance examination for the Navy. Now, all who have looked into the matter are unanimous in this, that we ought to get boys from the various schools in the country. [""Hear, hear!""] We want to get them straight from school, and we do not approve of that forcing system by which a naval cadet before he enters the Britannia has been put under pressure at a very early age. Holding these views, with which my colleagues at the Admiralty entirely agree, I have communicated with the head masters of some of our great schools, and I find that some of them are anxious to have Navy classes with the object of passing boys directly into the Navy, just as older boys pass into the Army, straight from school. The difficulty in the way hitherto has been the question of age. If boys have to enter the Britannia when they are between 131/2 and 141/2 the time they can spend at school is too short, and they have to go to school very young. The head masters state that if we advance the age by a year, then they would be able to establish a Navy class. I held a conference with a few of the head masters who have rendered me great assistance, and who have entered cordially into the scheme that we should make an appeal to all the schools in order to get boys, not with the traditions of a forcing establishment, but with the traditions of general British schools where boys are reared. At that conference, besides the head 1506 masters, were the Secretary of the Civil Service Commission, the Captain of the Britannia, and the chief naval instructor of the Britannia; and they, one and all, came to the conclusion that if we advanced the age of the boys by a year it would be possible to give them a better and a more healthy education before they entered the Naval service, while the age for going to sea would not necessarily be increased. There is an objection in many quarters to increasing the age of sending to sea. The boys, however, would have 16 months of preliminary training instead of 23; but coming so much better prepared, and having done a good deal of school work before entering the Britannia, it is thought that the time can be shorter. This will be amply compensated by the possibility of devoting it more fully to the study of our own technical requirements. If the House approves that proposal, which we could carry out, we should raise the age of entry by a year, substituting shorter courses, but in those courses giving more special attention to the special technical requirements desired, and giving the boys, at the same time, such training in seamanship, in sailing, in boating, and so on, as is now given in the Britannia. [Cheers.] But our views with regard to the admission of boys to the Naval service do not stop there. After the most careful consideration, after a review of the previous inquiries, we have come to the conclusion that the Britannia itself now an old ship, holding now 270 cadets, whereas it only held at one time 150 cadets will not, for long, offer sufficient accommodation, or be the best for training which our boys could have. We propose to substitute as was proposed many years ago a college on shore for the Britannia. [""Hear, hear!""] The sanitary and disciplinary arrangements of the Britannia are extremely difficult to maintain at the highest point of efficiency. I have, however, on wish to depreciate the Britannia; but, without entering into the argument at this moment, I think better education, a more healthy education, and better discipline will be maintained by the arrangements I have suggested. I know there is no point which the House views with more interest than the period when the boys have passed through the training in the  1507 Britannia and training college. My hon. Friend the Member for King's Lynn asked me the other day with regard to the Training Squadron. He thought that the Training Squadron was insufficient, and he stated that he would like to see it increased in order to give more opportunities of seamanship to our midshipmen. I find a very considerable difference of opinion in naval circles on that point. Personally, I think there is a great deal of force in the contention of my hon. Friend. I think that though the Training Squadron has ships which still have sails, the training in ships which have sails is invaluable to sailors who have to combat the elements; yet there are a good many officers of the younger school who believe that our sailors and officers will never take the same trouble with regard to sails with which afterwards they may never have anything more to do. [""Hear, hear!""] They hold that the time so spent is somewhat wasted, as well as the money expended on the trainingships; and their view is that the young men ought to be exercised only in ironclads and torpedo destroyers. Between these two schools of thought it is difficult to decide; but it appears to me that this attack on the training and sailing system is very much like the objection brought against a study of the classics. Though the training may not be of direct use, I believe it to be invaluable. But training is, of course, also necessary in ironclads and in torpedo destroyers, and we have established a system of passing a number of men and officers through torpedo destroyers so as to accustom them to the management of this new form of swift vessel. We have a certain number attached to the Channel Squadron and at various ports, so that while we continue the training in the Training Squadron we are, I hope, meeting the views of the other school by training as far as possible in torpedo vessels and ironclads. I am glad to say that we have been able and in this respect I am sure the House will agree with me to increase the number of ships afloat to a very considerable degree. It is costly, no doubt, though scarcely in proportion to the experience which is gained. I pass now from the personnel to the question 1508 of mobilisation in the statements which are generally submitted to the House the question of the number of our ships at sea. We have strengthened our various squadrons; we have more ships in the Channel; we have more ships in the Mediterranean and in China. [""Hear, hear!""] We have also substituted efficient ships for the old coastguard ships, and we have organised the Flying Squadron, which has added largely to the number of our ships afloat. I am glad to be able to say that the organisation of this Flying Squadron created no disturbance whatever in any single dockyard, or in any other way. It was not a question of unparalleled effort. Orders were given that we required so many more ships to be put into commission. They were put into commission without any fuss or difficulty in the dockyards; and the rapidity with which some of the ships were docked and sent out reflected the highest credit on our dockyard authorities. [Cheers.] Notwithstanding that we have this larger number of ships at sea than usual, notwithstanding any necessary criticisms that may have been passed on many of the ships, or the faults that could be found almost with any ship that sailed the sea, the behaviour of our ships at sea has been good and has given satisfaction to the country. [""Hear, hear!""] It is marvellous what people will write occasionally on these matters. I saw an article from a paper I did not read the paper which the writer apparently thought important enough to circulate as a leaflet. It was to the effect that our ships were so constructed that it was dangerous for them to go to sea; and, therefore, they generally remained in the harbour. [Laughter.] I think that the number of ships which have been commissioned and floated are much greater in proportion than that of any other country, European or American. I say this in no spirit of boastfulness, but because it belongs to us as a maritime nation to have as many ships as we can. The commissioning additional ships for the Channel Squadron has given us the opportunity of putting into it the two latest results of British shipbuilding, the two latest creations of Sir William White, our most  1509 talented constructor-in-chief. They went to sea with the Channel Squadron, and the Admiral commanding the squadron was able to write as follows with regard to the Majestic:  ""I am thoroughly satisfied with the result of our first cruise in the new ships, and think the result is most creditable to the designers and fitters-out. We went through manoeuvres, target practice, and torpedo running, just as if we had been a year in commission; and although it was the first time and everything was new guns, torpedoes, and engines all went without a hitch. The ship steers well. She is quicker off her helm than the Royal Sovereign, and does not lose her way so much in turning."" This comes from a practical sailor, and it is a criticism of the last ships we have added to our fleet, the Magnificent and Majestic. With regard to torpedo destroyers our experience has been extremely satisfactory, and there have been some circumstances which have given us an opportunity of testing their strength. There was the Sunfish, for instance, which came from the north when just completed in a heavy gale, and small as she was she made a good voyage. Some hon. Members will remember the Daring running into Dover. A ship ran into her, but she was nevertheless able to keep at sea, and the naval architects who examined the results were surprised at the manner in which so slight a vessel had been able to stand the strain. I trust that the House will forgive me if I dwell upon these points, because they are of very considerable interest to the country at large, and there are criticisms made which we are not often able to answer. This is another report of the experience gained in a recent collision with another vessel:  ""The torpedo-boat destroyer Lightning, when proceeding at a speed of 14 knots, collided with another vessel. The collision tore away the whole of the Lightning's bows, and her subsequent grounding twice without material damage, proved that these vessels, though necessarily very lightly built to secure the high speed demanded, are yet capable of withstanding very severe damage without foundering."" I have thought that these reports on the new types, the Majestic and the torpedo destroyers, would not be without interest to the House. I would now recall the attention of the House to one of my opening remarks about the consequential expense attendant on the increase of 1510 armaments. I turn, therefore, to the subject of ordnance armaments, guns, and ammunition. In this respect I think scarcely sufficient provision has been made in the last two years' Estimates, but I do not wish to attach any special blame for this. I am most anxious we should all co-operate together, without party recriminations, in this work. Probably and naturally the late Government thought that the ships would not make that progress to completion with the immense rapidity which we have seen exhibited. At all events, we have fallen behind in the construction of guns, but I trust we shall be able to pick up what we have lost, and with the view of doing so we have spent PS200,000 extra in the present financial year, for which I shall propose a Vote in the Supplementary Estimates. But next year, having gone into the examination ship by ship in the same manner as we have done in the case of the men and again I say this is no haphazard Vote I regret to say it will be necessary to ask the House to assent to an increase of no less than PS850,000 on Vote 9, for ordnance and ammunition. The Vote, that is to say, will be increased from PS1,693,000 to PS2,543,000, an increase of more than 50 per cent. That is imperatively necessary [cheers], and we shall look to the producing power of the country to supply us with that amount of guns and ammunition. If there are hon. Members on the other side who think this is too much, let them put themselves in the position of necessity arising and ships being ready and there being no guns or ammunition for them. Check the ships if you wish, but do not grant the ships and refuse their armaments. [""Hear, hear!""] I am afraid this is not the only result of the increased requirements for guns and ammunition. If we have more guns and ammunition, with the corresponding reserves, we require more storage room, more magazines. Fresh magazines are required. I may state that the old hulks in which powder has been stored have become to be regarded as positively dangerous, and the question of magazines must be vigorously taken in hand. For this purpose we think that nearly half-a-million will be required. That, again, I think we may consider as capital expenditure, and provision will be  1511 made for it in the Naval Works Bill. It may be convenient for me to state what other expenditure we intend to provide under the Vote. Increased dock accommodation was provided by the Act of the late Government. Amongst other works, there is the long-desired extension of the Mole at Gibraltar, and other works connected with that port. Money was also taken for a dock, but the House may remember that in the Bill of the late Government the word ""dock"" was inserted in the schedule, but at the instance of the House of Commons the word ""docks"" was substituted; and a shipbuilder, whose loss we all regret Sir E. Harland recommended that the dock which was being built should be increased to 700 feet. Apart from that, another argument has been urged namely, that if the dock were increased to 700 feet two vessels might possibly be docked in it at one time. [""Hear, hear!""] ""Docks,"" as distinguished from ""dock,"" implies a certain amount of increased accommodation in various ways, and that at Gibraltar means a considerable amount of money. I do not know whether the House of Commons approaches this matter with a light heart. At all events the Admiralty have not done so. If there is one point on which we have concentrated the best attention at our command it was as to what should be done at Gibraltar. The matter involved an immense amount of responsibility, and admittedly there are considerations on one side and the other; but finally we came to the conclusion that an effort must be made to make that necessary accommodation at Gibraltar which its strategic position and the requirements of the Navy render necessary, and we have concluded to build three docks instead of one and to provide the necessary accommodation. The cost of the new works is estimated at 2frac14; millions, in addition to the PS361,000 already provided for the one dock. [""Oh!"" and a voice, ""Shame!""] The amount, I admit, is large; I do not think it is staggering, and I shall be surprised if we do not in this matter receive the support, not of a unanimous House of Commons, but of a very large portion of the House of Commons. [Cheers.] I ought to add that we have not only considered the point by ourselves, but we have 1512 called in the experts of the War Office. We have considered all the questions with regard to the strategic position of Gibraltar, and certainly not without the fullest consideration, but with a deep sense of our responsibility, we shall ask the House of Commons to include this additional amount in the Vote. Nor have we confined our attention to Gibraltar. It has been our duty to take a survey of all parts of our Empire [""Hear, hear!""], and to see where dock accommodation was necessary in the changed circumstances of naval policy and strategy. I have no professional opinion upon this, but I am told that modern iron ships require more docking than the wooden ships of olden time. We have had to look to various parts of the globe, where I will not say our interests might be menaced, but where we ought to be prepared to defend them, and it will probably be necessary for us to add to the works which were proposed by the right hon. Gentleman opposite. We do not in present circumstances intend to ask for a dock at Mauritius or Simon's Town, at the Cape of Good Hope. We believe a dock at Mauritius is necessary, and we shall ask for money in the Estimates to make a preliminary survey with regard both to Mauritius and Simon's Town. We think that better than putting any amounts into the Naval Works Bill this year, for the following reason that it is impossible to estimate the cost, and the House of Commons might only be unwittingly deceived if we were to insert any sum in the Bill before the preliminary surveys are completed. In the Naval Works Bill of last year, for example, Dover was inserted. It is highly probable that the amount set down on account of the works there is underestimated by a very large sum. I believe the right hon. Gentleman opposite took the figure of two millions from old Estimates made many years ago, having no other figures to go by, and it being impossible to find any others. We shall propose a Naval Works Bill on the lines of the Act of last year that is to say, a Bill to be renewed in the next financial year because we feel that at present we have not got sufficient knowledge to estimate as regards Dover or the other docks which I have mentioned. The works which I have enumerated and  1513 certain other minor proposals raise the amount taken in the Naval Works Act of last year from PS8,500,000 to PS14,000,000, which will be the amount laid down in the new Bill. These are large Estimates, but the House will not be staggered by the amount [cheers] unless hon. Members can put their finger on one single item where they think that economy ought to be enforced. It is not lightly that we have included these large sums in our Estimates. It is with a full conviction that this expenditure is necessary. With regard to the finance of the Bill, I am authorised by the Chancellor of the Exchequer to state that he will put aside the surplus of this year, after satisfying the Supplementary Estimates, to make a fund which, in the first instance, shall supply the expenditure under this Naval Works Bill. [""Hear, hear!""] Instead of borrowing with one hand and setting up annuities and perhaps at the same time buying Consols or other securities with the surplus, my right hon. Friend has generously placed the surplus at the disposal of the Admiralty for the purposes of the Naval Works Bill. [Cheers.] I now pass to that which perhaps will be more interesting to the House namely, the question of ships. Let me in a few sentences review the past; and let us look for a moment at the efforts of the last few years, in order that we may obtain a glance at the whole of the naval shipbuilding which this country has considered to be necessary. I will start with the Naval Defence Act of 1889. Of course in that first year there were certain ships under construction, the expenditure on which I leave out. I start afresh with the Naval Defence Act. There are three periods that of the Naval Defence programme; then that of the programme intermediate between the Defence Act and what is called Lord Spencer's great programme, which includes the ships built in 1892-3 and 1893-4; and thirdly, that of Lord Spencer's programme of 1894. The Naval Defence Act added 70 ships to the Navy, of which 10 were battleships. The intermediate period supplied three battleships the Renown, the Majestic, and the Magnificent; five cruisers, including the Powerful and the Terrible, four sloops, and six torpedo-boat destroyers. Then came Lord 1514 Spencer's programme, under which the following ships have been or are now being constructed seven first-class battleships, four first-class cruisers of the Diadem type, six second-class cruisers of the Talbot type, four second-class cruisers of the Arrogant type, two third-class cruisers of the Pelorus and Proserpine type, and 56 torpedo-boat destroyers. No ships of this latter programme are complete as yet the time has been too short except some 20 torpedo-boat destroyers. Adding the 70 ships built under the Naval Defence Act, the 12 under the intermediate programme, and the 23 under Lord Spencer's programme, we reach the total of 105 ships and 62 torpedo-boat destroyers which have been commenced, part of them finished and part still under construction, between 1889 and 1896. That is a formidable list a great list; and yet I shall have to ask the House to add to it. [Cheers.] The effect of the Naval Defence Act is now apparent. Up to now we have only the Majestic and Magnificent of the ships belonging to Lord Spencer's programme. Of course it is not in the first year that one sees the good effect of it; but of the 70 ships built under the Naval Defence Act there are at present in commission 10 battleships, 27 cruisers, nine torpedo gunboats. The Mediterranean Squadron has three Defence Act battleships out of nine, and six out of seven first and second-class cruisers. The Channel Squadron has four Naval Defence Act ships out of six, and the Particular Service Squadron is, except for torpedo-boat destroyers, entirely composed of ships of the Naval Defence Act. Therefore you will see from the present ships afloat how much is due to the effort made at the time of which we are now reaping satisfactory results. There are two ways by which we may increase our force either by the acceleration of ships building or by the laying down of new ships. I am not sure whether the acceleration of ships building is not as important an element in policy as the laying down of new ships; and that policy of acceleration is a policy to which we are committed, and which we wish the House of Commons to endorse. [Cheers.] During the present year we have endeavoured to hasten the programme which was laid down by the  1515 right hon. Gentleman opposite. We have done so by putting more men on the battleships, and so finishing them earlier. We have hurried on the order for armour a most important fact, if we require more armour in future years; because though, of course, there is a great industry for the supply of armour, yet it is necessarily limited. Therefore we have only taken time by the forelock, and have spent more money upon armour in the present financial year than the original Estimates contemplated. The Supplementary Estimate which it will be our duty to propose to the House amounts to PS1,100,000. It includes an excess of PS150,000 for wages in the dockyards, that is for the additional men we have put on to make the Majestic and the Magnificent ready earlier, and to have them in the Channel Squadron at the present moment, and for other work. We have spent PS300,000 more on armour; PS325,000 more on stores, and PS200,000 in armaments and munitions for guns and Maxims. By this amount we undoubtedly relieve the burden on the coming financial year. Whether it is fair to do so, hon. Members will be able to judge in a few moments, when I come to that which we propose to place on the Estimates for the year 1896-97. I may say here that we have increased the men in the dockyards up to 23,000; and I think that I ought, in passing, to pay a tribute to the organisation of our dockyards and those who have assisted in building our ships. There is the greatest emulation, I am glad to say, between the various dockyards. They take the greatest possible pride in finishing a ship before the time in which a corresponding ship was finished in another dockyard. The emulation between Chatham and Portsmouth is most healthy and exhilarating, and it is pleasant to see the men taking this interest in their work and their delight in turning out ships well and swiftly. The output of work will bear the closest criticism, in regard to either time, efficiency, or economy. It reflects the greatest credit upon the officers of the yards and on all the workmen. [""Hear, hear!""] The unexampled rapidity in the construction of battle ships has not in the least interfered with the other works in the yards. It is 1516 extra work that has been done. I know that it has been said that this rapidity affects the efficiency; that the men have been taken away from other ships. But that is not so. The up-keep of the fleet in commission and the thorough-going efficiency of the ships in the reserve have been fully maintained. With regard to the question of sacrificing efficiency to cheapness, it has been said that complaints have been made by the overseers or captains of newly commissioned ships. The records of the Admiralty contain no mention whatever of such complaints. [Cheers.] I have spoken of the year in which we are at present. Now I come to 1896-97. We start with having under construction a formidable number of ships eight battleships, 21 cruisers, and 40 torpedo boat destroyers. Let me approach the question of battleships from the points of view of number and class. I am not going to place before the House comparative lists of the navies of foreign countries and of our own. It is, no doubt, a matter which has to be done, and we at the Admiralty have given days and weeks and months to the consideration of the relative strength of the different navies. I propose, not to place before the House the processes or figures by which we have arrived at our results; I propose only to give those results, with some indication of the system which we have followed. One paramount rule which we have laid down in all comparisons is that size alone is no criterion of the fighting value of a ship. [Cheers.] The Leader of the Opposition caused tables to be prepared showing the first-class battleships of various countries. Such lists are illusory to a certain extent, unless they are accompanied by numberless explanations; and even then such controversies would gather round them that it would be impossible to elucidate them. But we have proceeded by analysing, as regards battleships, all such forces as ought to be taken into consideration. We have been aware of this fact that there are first-class battleships belonging to ourselves which are at present not much more efficient than some second-class battleships; and, on the other hand, that there are some second-class battleships which may be ranked in certain circumstances as equal to first-class battleships. We look at the matter as a whole. We take a second-class  1517 battleship which is capable, as regards armament, armour, and speed, of competing with a first-class battleship. You must send a first-class battleship against it. Nevertheless, that second-class ship is unequal to the first-class, because it has not got the coal-carrying capacity, and, therefore, it is only under certain given circumstances that the second-class ship is equal to the first-class. In the construction of battleships there are four desiderate speed, armament defensive armour, and coal carrying capacity. To secure these objects, if you want to secure them all in their fullest efficiency, you require vessels of a certain size, and when you want to decrease the size of that vessel, you must make up your minds which of those four desiderata you are prepared to sacrifice, and that sacrifice you will choose according to the special circumstances of the nation. Those who are prepared for defensive naval strategy may leave out coal-carrying capacity; those who believe that theirs must be an offensive policy must on no account surrender coal-carrying capacity, and so it happens when you compare one of our ships having large coal-carrying capacity, and also considerable capacity for carrying ammunition with a foreign ship has thicker armour, but what is her coal-carrying capacity? You must make a sacrifice on one side or the other, and it is only when you bear in mind these first principles you will do justice to your own ships, or be able to form a proper opinion. No naval architect is able to combine all these desiderata together under a certain size. I will read an extract from the speech on the French Navy Estimates by the reporter on the French Naval Budget, because it very neatly expresses the doctrine of which I am speaking, and which has a great bearing on the selection of ships. M. Thomson said:  ""It is certain that if the problem of modern construction is not insoluble, it is at least very delicate and very complex. Naval construction becomes more and more complicated. We are at this moment in a period of transformation, development and trial. Every ship brought into existence puts the type which it replaces in the Fleet into a lower grade, and only bears a distant resemblance to that type. Every armourclad is a compromise. Beyond the multiple and very various requirements, it would be impossible to conceive a type which would not give a 1518 handle to any criticism. To instal on the hull of a medium tonnage weapons of war of a tremendous power, to put under the protection of an armoured wall formidable fighting instruments where bronze, iron, and steel are crowded together in every shape, to give to this mass a large radius of action, a high speed, it is almost the pursuit of the improbable. But have the goodness to believe it the foreigner no more than we possesses the solution of this difficult problem."" We say the same. No country more than ourselves has power to solve this problem. I thought I would place before the House some of the various differences of opinion which exist with reference to what you ought to sacrifice; but I have already detained you so long and I have still a certain amount of ground to go over that I will refrain from doing so on the present occasion. I will confine myself to saying that the whole ship must be taken into consideration, also the differences as regards the disposition of armament. A choice must, therefore be made. That choice must depend on the special requirements of the particular nation for whom the ships are built. It is strongly held by the present Board of Admiralty I believe it has been held by past Boards that the range of action in the case of English ships must not be crippled, and that coal-carrying is one of the most vital necessities. We must have ships equal in fighting capacity and we must have coal-carrying capacity also, in order to enable our ships to remain at sea. Consequently, in any ships we may propose we cannot go below a certain size, unless we accept the doctrine that they are to be Channel ships only. Some of our rivals have fine fighting ships, but their inadequate coal-carrying capacity prevents them going beyond the Channel. We think we ought not to build such ships, because we require our vessels not only in the Channel, but in distant parts of the world we require ships ready to go anywhere and to do anything. [""Hear, hear!""] I will put before the House the number of ships which we propose to add to those now under construction. We propose to add five battleships, four first-class cruisers, three second-class cruisers, six third-class cruisers, and 28 torpedo-boat destroyers. The first-class cruisers will be of the Diadem type, the second class of the Talbot, and the third-class of the Pelorus type. With regard to the torpedo-boat  1519 destroyers, I must inform the House, looking to the extraordinary urgency of proceeding with that class of boat seeing they were sanctioned by the late Cabinet and entered into the programme of Lord Spencer we have ordered eight of them in anticipation of the verdict of the House of Commons. Of course, if the House of Commons so chooses, they will strike them off the number we now propose. With regard to this list of cruisers, the House will observe that they are to be according to existing types the Diadem, the Talbot, and the Pelorus. The five battleships are to be improved Renowns. In order to avoid any misconception, I may say these designs were prepared by Sir William White before he left. Sir William White has been indisposed for some months, but before he started on his holiday for the restoration of his health, he was able to approve of the whole of the programme which we now produce to the House. I have his authority for it, and his authority is a great one. [""Hear, hear!""] Sir William White has built 130 battleships, and not one of them has had a deeper draught or has erred in stability from the calculations which he had made. His recent ships, the Magnificent and the Majestic have had 200 tons less weight when launched than his design. The new Renowns will be 390 feet in length, 74 feet in breadth, and have a displacement of 12,900 tons. They are thus 2,000 tons smaller than the Majestic, and draw about two feet less water, a point to which we attach very great importance. They will have the same coal endurance and rather greater speed. They will be fitted with water-tube boilers, and will consequently be able to steam further at a high speed than the Majestic class. The main armament will be the same as that of the Majestic class. The protective arrangements are also similar, but there will be less thickness of armour. We believe that, through the coal arrangements in the bunkers alongside the deficiencies in armour will be amply compensated by the advantages we have gained in other respects. I have compared the new Renown with the Majestic. As compared with the old Renown, the 1520 new ships will be greatly superior in armament namely, 12-in. as against 10-in. guns, and in barbette armour 12-in. as against 10-in., and two more 6-in. quick-firing guns. In citadel protection the principal portion of the protected area has the same thickness in both cases 6-in. The Renown has a little 8-in. armour, but the new ships will have their citadels about 15 feet longer. For continuous steaming over long distances, the new vessels will have an advantage in speed of two knots. These five battleships, added to the seven battleships which are now building under Lord Spencer's programme, and the Renown, will constitute 13 battleships which will be under construction during the present year. [""Hear, hear!""] With regard to the number of cruisers, I wish to say to those who think it is either too great or too small, it has again not been decided upon haphazard. The First Naval Lord has gone over every station, every trade route, and has considered the composition of the squadrons of the Mediterranean, North Sea, and Channel, on the Irish coasts, and in distant parts. He has allotted so many cruisers to these particular places. This number of cruisers is based not upon a comparison of the number of cruisers other nations have, because their conditions are entirely different from ours, but upon the question what we have to defend, what services will have to be performed, in what direction the food supply will have to be protected, and what resources we have. This number of cruisers, added to those which have gone before, and with the addition of a few third-class cruisers which may still have to be asked for in a future year, represents the deliberate opinion of the Board of Admiralty. Whether we err or not, it is the deliberate opinion of the Board of Admiralty as to the requirements of the day. [""Hear, hear!""] I am now approaching the end of my very long story. I have placed before the House the number of ships which we propose to add to the Navy. We do not propose to proceed by Bill, because it is intended to begin all these ships during the present financial year.  1521 I may say that, looking at these additional ships, the House is entitled to know that the cost, in addition to what we have in hand at the beginning of the year, spread over three years, is PS10,000,000 sterling. That is for the new ships. We propose to finish the whole of the Spencer ships, and the whole of our own ships, by July, 1899. On the present year there will be a proposed increase of PS1,860,000 on Vote 8. Now I have placed before the House roughly the effect generally of our Estimates. There is an increase for men, including the reserve, of PS300,000; shipbuilding, PS1,860,000; ordnance, PS850,000; new works, PS70,000 more than last year, exclusive of the Naval Works Bill, and other Votes, PS42,000; or a total increase of PS3,122,000 on the Votes of last year. The total Navy Estimates are PS21,823,000. In 1895-96, they were PS18,701,000, there being thus an increase of PS3,122,000. In regard to items of new construction, the amount will be PS7,385,000, as compared with PS5,393,000. In previous years the amounts were 1892-93, PS4,050,000; in 1893-94, PS2,984,000; in 1894-95, PS4,477,000; and in 1895-96, PS5,393,000; and in this year, PS7,385,000. The amount of increased wages in the dockyards is PS294,000. Three battleships, one first-class cruiser, and one third-class cruiser will be built in the dockyards. The remainder will be built by contract. The three battleships to be built in the dockyards will be commenced when the ships on the slips at Chatham, Devonport, and Portsmouth are completed. This will insure a continuity of work in the dockyards. Tenders for the two battleships to be built by contract will be given out next month. The whole of the third-class cruisers will be commenced at once. Indeed, I have gone so far as to invite tenders, and as soon as Parliament sanctions them the whole will be put in hand at once. Stringent limits as to the date of their completion will be 1522 inserted in the contracts. They ought to be ready within 13 months from the time of their commencement. The same holds good with regard to the torpedo-boat destroyers. The whole of the tenders for these will be invited at once. The first and second-class cruisers will be commenced in the autumn. The House will see that the whole of this Programme will be commenced and pushed on in the financial year 1896-97. The Programme on which the Board of Admiralty agree is embodied in the Vote of that year, with the few exceptions I have already stated. A broad view has been taken of the Navy, and we believe that now we have arrived at some point on which we may stand. There will be 13 battleships, 10 first-class cruisers, 19 second-class cruisers, eight third-class cruisers, and 90 torpedo-boat destroyers, which form the joint Programme of Lord Spencer and the present Board of Admiralty. The cost of the whole of this, beginning with 1894-5, added to as it has been by myself, will be about PS28,000,000. The cost of the Naval Defence Act was PS21,000,000. Five million pounds were spent in the two intervening years on these ships. And now about PS28,000,000 is the joint Programme of Lord Spencer and ourselves, forming from the year 1889 to 1899 an aggregate expenditure of PS55,000,000 upon new construction. I may now sum up. The House will remember that we ask for a supplementary Estimate of PS1,000,000 and for Estimates which this year amount to nearly PS22,000,000. I give these figures to the House not in any spirit of boastfulness or exaggeration. That is far from our desire. These are not Estimates of provocation [cheers] they are Estimates of self-defence. [Cheers.] They are Estimates based on the special conditions of this country conditions which are not those of any other country on our scattered possessions, on the position of our food supply, and on our colonial Empire. They are based on the  1523 security of our own shores. [Cheers.] If foreign countries look at these Estimates they must not compare them with what they spend upon their navies. They must consider comparatively what they spend upon their armies [""Hear, hear!""] because the squadrons which we send to sea are the corps d'armee that we place upon our frontiers as they place corps d'armee upon theirs. [Cheers.] Then they have conscription and their vast military armaments. We have our small, though, I hope, excellent, Army. [""Hear, hear!""] But it is to our ships and our Navy that we look. [Cheers.] And an increase of these, even a large increase in our Estimates, ought not in any degree to excite the jealousy or emulation of any foreign nation. We are doing no more than we consider absolutely necessary for our self-defence. [""Hear, hear!""] Some words of mine have been misconstrued to mean indifference to the maintenance of friendships with other countries. No statesman can feel such indifference. [""Hear, hear!""] When we are taunted, as has been continually the case, with what has been called our isolation, we have a right to tell them how we regard that alleged isolation ourselves. We have a right to explain its nature and limits to our countrymen. But, however that may be, whether we be isolated or not, whether in any great strain that may come upon us which God forbid we should be unaided by allies, or whether in any general disturbance of peace, we should take our place side by side with other Powers, the British people are unanimous that our fleets should represent the self-reliance of a great nation. [Cheers.] To that unanimity the Government commend these Estimates, satisfied that their cost will be cheerfully borne by the nation, and trusting that they will be accepted, as they have been conceived, in a spirit of moderation, though framed on a scale which, with a full sense of responsibility, we deem adequate for the occasion.

967935	967935	S4V0160P0-03184	1906-07-12	ARMY ESTIMATES, 1906-7.	THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (Mr. HALDANE,	Haddington	"THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (Mr. HALDANE, Haddington): I think it will be for the convenience of the Committee that I should at once make a full statement. What I have to lay before the Committee is nothing else than the proposals of the Cabinet regarding the reorganisation of the forces of the King. This debate has been anticipated with a lively interest. It has given rise to a vast amount of ingenious and intelligent anticipation. These anticipations have not been confined to the Press. My two right hon. predecessors have exercised themselves upon the subject. I much regret personally that my right hon. friend, Mr. Brodrick, is not to-day present in the House for the purposes of this discussion. He has mobilised his forces against me. He has brought his artillery to bear upon my artillery. He has pronounced my scheme, although he had not yet come in sight of it, as in part a national calamity, and in part a national crime. I cannot discuss Mr. Brodrick's letter in his absence; but I will make this observation it is not always a safe thing to use your artillery against an enemy whose position you have not yet ascertained. You are apt to disclose your own position and to use up your ammunition in vain. But Mr. Brodrick is not the only ex-Minister who has entered the lists. The right hon. Gentleman the Member for Croydon has been more cautious. But in his case, too, there have been symptoms of feverish activity which have urged him to rush into print, if not into war. Well, what I have to say may, perhaps, make a good many of the criticisms that have been made seem beside the point. But there are other things on which, I think, we are all agreed. One of them is this I do not care in what part of the House he sits, but I believe there is hardly a Member who is not profoundly convinced that the state of our national forces is highly unsatisfactory. Whether you come to the matter from the point of view of cost, or from the point of view of organisation, there is much to be done, resolute effort to be made, before things can be brought to a satisfactory condition. The Government has both of these considerations to bear in mind  cost and efficiency. As it has been 1076 suggested that I, for one, have been driven into a desire to reduce the Army Estimates and to put a check on the extravagance which has been been growing up, I desire, most emphatically, to associate myself with the proposition of the necessity for check and reduction. It was the Duke of Wellington who used to say that no greater harm could be done to the British Army than to associate it in the public mind with extravagance. I am sure that that is not only true, but that it is the view of many of the most thoughtful soldiers to-day, who hold very strongly that before you can restore public confidence in the Army you must make the people feel that they are getting value for their money. Then there are other considerations bearing upon this question of the growth and cost and burden of armaments. I do not repeat the solemn warning which was given to the House recently by my right hon, friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer. I do not repeat the equally solemn warning that was given by an ox-Chancellor of the Exchequer, Lord St. Aldwyn, in another place not long ago, and corroborated by Lord Goschen. I think we all feel that with the income-tax at a shilling, and the public finances in the state in which they are, it is time, at least, that the situation should be closely and carefully surveyed. Then there is another consideration. The democracies of the world, however they may he divided on other points, are at one in making manifest at this moment their desire that the crushing burdens of armaments which press upon them should be lightened. We in this great, rich, and powerful country have the opportunity of taking our share in that movement. We mean to give the lead. But it is not merely the point of view of economy that has rendered it necessary that the situation of the Army should be closely reviewed. It is essential also from the point of view of organisation and efficiency. Since I came to the War Office I have been struck with this that while never before, perhaps, in the history of our country, have we had finer soldiers or better officers than those thoughtful new men who have matured since the trial of the great war in South Africa, still we suffer from the disorganisation and the want of intelligent principle in the arrangement of our forces, which put  1077 every attempt to make things better to naught. You have evidences of that at every turn. We have had many schemes of Army reorganisation in the past; but it has generally been the alternation of an Army without a scheme or a scheme without an Army; and the time seems to have come, in the opinion of soldiers and the public, for an attempt, a resolute attempt, to be made to turn schemes of Army reorganisation into realities. Since I have been at the War Office I have been approached by many of the modern type of officers to whom I have referred, who have said to me "" No soldier but would like more money and more men. But we recognise that the nation demands retrenchment, and we know the grounds upon which it is held to be necessary. We do not dispute those grounds; we are prepared to agree with them. But this much we say to you use the power, if you can obtain it from this new Parliament, full of vigour and ideas, to reorganise the Army in such a fashion that it shall be fit for the only purpose for which an army is needed the purpose of war. We hate war. Would that the day had come when the curse of war might be averted from us, when it was no longer necessary to prepare forces for our defence. But till that day comes it is our duty to see that every penny spent on the Army is spent on fighting efficiency."" That is the view of the Army. That is the view of the Army Council. That is the view of many soldiers of every shade of politics some of them in this House who have come to me and said "" Do not lose this great opportunity for asking Parliament to reorganise us it may be in a drastic and searching fashion  but to reorganise us in such a way that we shall be fit for war.""  That is the keynote of the attempt at! Army reform of my colleagues and myself which I have to-day to lay before the House of Commons. Some time ago I made a speech in introducing the Army Estimates, in which I laid down ' certain principles, which I said were engaging my attention and the attention of my advisers and which seemed to be reasonable. We had a great deal of discussion on them, and some of them form the foundation of what I have to say to-day. I am not going to restate at length those principles or to repeat what I then said. I asked for time to consider them. The House has been generous to 1078 me. It has not pressed me to hurry over my difficult and delicate task. I have had time to think; and today I wish to use the period of the debate which I shall occupy for the purpose of ' stating the concrete proposals in which these principles have resulted as distinguished from the grounds on which those principles were based. I shall only summarise very shortly what I have already laid down. But before I do so let me make one observation. I concur entirely in the view that we owe in approaching this task a great deal to the work that has been done. The Committee of Imperial Defence has, to my mind, been a most valuable institution in bringing out certain broad principles. The right hon. Gentleman opposite, the Leader of the Opposition, did the nation a service when he devised an instrument which should bring Admiralty policy and War Office policy into contact with the general policy of the Empire. It is largely due to the discussions which have taken place in that body, and to the light which has been obtained by surveying things not merely in isolation but as a whole that it is possible to get some coherent view, be it right or wrong, of the problem that lies in front of us. One other thing I wish to say. I have stated that while soldiers generally would naturally like more men and more money, the wisest of them see the necessity of a stern attempt at reduction. On that hypothesis, on the hypothesis that economy is necessary, on the hypothesis that those who insist on economy are ready to extend to them also the boon of reorganisation reorganisation on the basis that war and war only is the thing for which an army ought to exist  I have been able, if I may so say, to enter into a covenant with the influential representatives of the Army. They have put their best strength into the propositions which I have to lay before the Committee, which propositions would have been of very little value if they had been my own propositions only, but are propositions which have been accepted and endorsed by the Cabinet after they have been worked out to the last point by the highest skilled experts who are at present responsible for the work of the General Staff, for the work of the Adjutant-General's Department, and for the work of the Quartermaster - General and the Ordnance  1079 Departments of the War Office. I cannot f express my obligations too deeply to my colleagues of the Army Council for assisting me in the way they have done to work out the scheme of reorganisation which I have to present, and on the hypothesis that reductions are right the whole-hearted concurrence they have expressed in a proposal which, just because it is their own, I believe will result in the increase of the efficiency for fighting purposes of the British Army by 50 per cent. I cannot but express my thanks to those young officers who have thrown their energies and their minds into this question. These proposals result in a large reduction of men and of money; and yet, by the reorganisation of the Army as a whole, the result is produced in a form in which, if we have had to pare down, we have also used our materials in building up and completing the structure so that at last it is homogeneous. But economy and efficiency are not incompatible things. Look at the great industrial concerns, the railways and big manufacturing establishments how are they made to pay their dividends? Why, by going through every item of their accounts, and asking why and for what reason has this money been spent, and what justification there is for every item. We have been living laborious days at the War Office during the last few months. I am afraid the eight hours movement shows no signs of reaching that great Department, and, more than that, we have put the Army lately on a very frugal and somewhat niggardly administration; but the result has been that we have been able to go through the Army piece by piece, and bit by bit, inquiring why that bit is there, whether it is sound, whether there is any excess, aye, and what is equally important, whether there is any deficiency. We have applied to the Army the same procedure that an accountant would apply in investigating the affairs of a business; we have gone through it bit by bit, and asked in what condition that bit is, and what justification there is for the money spent upon it. We have put as regards every officer and man, and every pound spent, the determining question: What does that officer, that man, that money mean, tested by the standard of efficiency for war? 1080 When I last spoke in this House, on March 8th last,+ I laid down certain broad principles. The first question which I then discussed and to which I sought to find an answer was what was the purpose for which the British Army exists; and the answer was a very simple one. It was for war overseas. No doubt you have to provide for home defence, but the primary task which rests on the British Army is to maintain the defence of an Empire which extends over 12,000,000 of square miles and embraces a population of 400,000,000 of people. Therefore it is no use making comparisons between the army of Great Britain and the armies of France and Germany. They fight for the defence of their own frontiers. They have to maintain great land forces and to maintain them under an organisation which does not require to proceed much oversea, but which is adapted to resist attack and to make counter-attacks within a comparatively restricted area. The British Army exists for a totally different purpose, and there is no ground for comparing them. If you wish to make a comparison you must compare the British Army and Navy with the armies and navies of other Powers, and then I think you need be under no apprehension as to the result of the comparison. The first purpose for which we want any army is for oversea war. The Fleet defends our coast. The right hon. Gentleman the Member for the City of London in a most instructive and powerful speech last summer laid down the doctrine that the Navy was adequate to protect these coasts, except against raids, which could not, in his opinion, exceed 10,000 men, and were only to be feared at certain points I do not think with my hon. and gallant friend the Member for Central Sheffield that anything has occurred in the recent manoeuvres to shake our confidence in that principle. The doctrine was the result of the most careful and scientific consideration to which the late Government devoted itself, with the assistance of the most skilled experts, and it is a doctrine which, I believe, remains unshaken to-day; it is the foundation of our policy, and such raids must be met with good mobolisation schemes. + See (4)Debates, cliii., 655,et seq..  1081 Then I come to the second proposition. If it be true that the Fleet is adequate, and far more than adequate, with its tremendous strength of to-day, to defend our shores, then our expeditionary force ought to be moulded for oversea warfare, and that being so, it is bound to be a finer and more costly force than that of a nation which keeps an army merely to defend itself within its own frontiers. It cannot rest upon conscription, for it requires regularly trained men for a large part of its work, giving their whole time to their duties; and consequently no conscription can be sufficient to maintain it On the other hand, it is a force that need not be large as continental forces are large. Compared from the point of view of oversea work, our available forces are enormously larger than those of the Continent. ""What nation is there on the Continent that could mobolise and send oversea anything like the troops we sent to South Africa? Our business is to maintain an expeditionary force just as large as to form a reserve which may enable us swiftly and resolutely to reinforce the outposts of our forces, which are the outposts of the Empire, and which acts as its police. When you come to the necessity for expansion we all know it may arise, but it can arise only upon great occasions in such a case, when we are involved in such a war that the whole soul of the people has to be thrown into the task of their defence, we may assume that the people will be ready to bear their share of the burden, and if they have been prepared beforehand to organise themselves on a voluntary basis, they will be ready to respond with a strength and a might which no conscription can get out of them. But it is not only the people of this country. The South African war showed that the Empire was one and could fight as one, just as the nation could fight. Therefore you have behind the reserves of your own people the reserves of the Empire, so long as you do not alienate them  and so long as you do not gall them by fiscal restrictions and make them feel that being within the Empire is a burden on their freedom rather than a help to it. So long as these conditions remain fulfilled, experience shows that we may rely in a supreme emergency on the whole strength of the Empire. 1082 Therefore I, for one, am not the least troubled by the alarmist cry of not finding any Reserves behind the Regular forces of the Crown unless you resort to compulsory service conscription. The people of this country will not be dragooned into giving Military service. Lord Cardwell used to say that, so far from being a nation of shopkeepers, the British were the most fighting nation on earth. I think that the interest of our people is more profound, more real and spontaneous probably, than that of any other nation in the world. The keenness and willingness of our people to give up time to volunteering and to the study of military organisation is one of the striking features we have to deal with. It may be said indeed that the true conception of our system is that of a triangle with a sharp point of the finest tempered metal extended and resting on a broad base of metal which may be soft and yet will harden under blows. There is another purpose which one has to bear in mind, and this is the fourth proposition which I wish to submit for consideration. It is not merely to produce an expeditionary force that we have to keep troops at home. We have to maintain for the sake of our distant possessions forces abroad which have to be fed largely from home; therefore you must maintain sufficient troops at home to keep alive and feed the troops you have got abroad. These fix the limit below which you cannot diminish your forces at home. You cannot make four except out of quantities equivalent to two and two. Therefore you must keep sufficient troops at home. Then I come to the limit of possible reduction, and that is my fifth proposition, that it is determined by what we have to maintain abroad. In India, for example, at the present time we have a large force paid for by the Indian Government, but maintained by us because it is a British force in India. We have eleven horse, forty-two field, and three Howitzer batteries, twenty-two garrison artillery companies and six heavy batteries, nine regiments of cavalry, and fifty-two battalions of the Line, equal to a strength on Feburary 1st last of 79,446 men. We are under an obligation to keep that force up. The size of that force was determined at the time of the Mutiny. It is there, not really to resist aggression on  1083 the part of the Great Powers; it is equally there for the purpose of preserving order in India. Whether it is too large or too small, it is at any rate a force whose size was fixed at that time and the standard has never been departed from. It was, however, allowed to fall below its level until at the time of the Pendjeh incident it was brought up to its former strength. The question whether or not the circumstances of the time make it possible to reduce the force is a question outside the scope of a War Minister's authority. How does the War Minister stand in face of that obligation? One of the most brilliant of our military critics wrote lately that the War Minister was thought to be planning for war, when all that he was thinking of was to maintain and to relieve the military policemen occupied in looking after a distant frontier. In these circumstances it is plain that if you are going to effect reductions the first thing you must look to is the state of the forces abroad. Can they be reduced? Your first reductions must be there. These are what you have to keep up. No juggling, no reverting from Cardwellian principles to other principles will help you. All the other schemes produced go to pieces before the experts and actuaries whose business it is to calculate how many drafts it will be needful to produce. As I have said, four cannot be reduced to a less equivalent than two and two when exposed to the ruthless criticism of the actuary. Nor does it do you any good to reduce establishments. If you reduce establishments you hamper yourselves in providing drafts, and you cannot reduce these without ruining the battalions. Your aim must be to do what Mr. Cardwell aimed at to keep the number of battalions abroad and at home as near as possible equal. It is very difficult, but the nearer you approach equality the further you get away from the other difficulty in the Cardwell system, whore, owing to the excess of units abroad, you have to put a certain number of battalions on short tour. Now I come to another great principle which I touched upon when I spoke before on this important subject. At that time I began to realise and my advisers now realise the fact most fully the possibility of following the example of foreign nations in making use of the Militia principle. 1084 I do not mean the Militia principle in. the technical sense of the word. I agree that there are certain combatant services which can only be performed by highly trained men. Much of the artillery work, for example, can only be performed by men of the highest training; but there is other work which can be done by men who have a limited military training and can take an engagement to go on mobilisation, who are fitted to perform services of a semi-civilian order to be found in every army  such work as Army service work, the provision of ammunition columns, and the Army medical work. A great deal of this can be obtained on a Militia basis. Yet somehow or other w e seem to have gone on the footing throughout, almost without a break in the history of our attempts at reorganisation of the Army, of assuming that that kind of work must be performed by Regulars. I can only say that we have added enormously to the cost of the Army in that way; and one source of economy which I hope to lay before the Committee, is got by the substitution in this work for the Regulars, of men who have received a partial military training in time of peace, and who are capable of taking up this kind of service on mobilisation. They are intermediate between the Regulars and the Volunteers, and they are, in the opinion of my advisers, and also judging by the experience of the foreign nations that employ them, to be got just as readily as the Regulars. They are so cheap that you can get a larger number of them for the same money or less. There are plenty of them, and they are easy to find; it is only a question of organising them. My last proposition relates to another great source of economy besides that of the Militia principle It has reference to the aim which should be before you as to the nature of your organisation. It must be organisation for war in a time of peace as well as on the outbreak of a war: that is to say, it does not do to pursue the haphazard policy of the past. When the South African war broke out we had at haphazard to mobilise our forces. If you take the forces which are available in the United Kingdom at the present time  Regulars, Reservists, Yeomanry, and Militia and ask yourselves what  1085 mobilisation you can get together, you find that the force is about330,000 inpersonnel. But you could not under the existing organisation for mobilising get more than 100,000 men, or two army corps. I have gone through the subject with the experts and actuaries, and the thing breaks down, not because the units are not there, but because there is no organisation for war which would enable us at every point to make complete arrangements for mobilisation. If we cannot mobilise for an over-sea purpose it is not because we have not the men, but because we have not the war organisation which exists in peace and a thoroughgoing plan adapted to the circumstances. Our proposals are founded on these eight propositions. They promise certain reductions. I may at once say that I propose in the name of my colleagues that the number of British soldiers shall be 20,000 fewer Regulars than exist at the present date. I am able to say in the name of the Army Council that, considering the Army as organised through the number of men we shall be able to get under the Militia principle, we should be able to mobilise in war and keep prepared in time of peace a force which contrasts with the old force as three army corps to two. This is got by rigidly adhering to the policy of writing oft everything that is useless for war purposes, by applying strictly the principle of organisation for war, by maintaining that organisation so that it shall exist in time of peace not merely on paper but in reality; so that you can mobilise your force faster almost than you can get transport to take it away. I will tell you what reductions we propose to make in the battalions abroad. When you have got the minimum below which you cannot reduce, you may as well take what you have at home and put it on the best organisation you can for the purposes of war. It costs nothing to do it, and with economy you can get a stronger force. What we have done is to go through the Army as it stands to-day unit by unit, man by man, item by item. What we have brought out is the great waste, the great extravagance, the great amount of inefficiency caused by the' absence of the machinery necessary to i make mobilisation possible. I will state at once what is the nature of the force which we propose 1086 to make it possible to organise not , only for war, but to organise so as to be to some extent a slumbering force ready to be awakened out of the Reserves in time of peace. It is a force: which is not organised in army corps, because army corps are, in the unanimous opinion of the experts, an inconvenient form in which to keep our troops. What one wants is something real and tangible; something that does exist there in time of peace; something of which the battalions and the cavalry and the guns and the men are there and available in time of war, and have to be brought from a very short distance. The best organisation for that purpose, in the unanimous opinion of the experts and throughout I have relied on the opinion of the experts; I have been guided by soldiers at every turn, for I myself am a mere civilian and man of business what we have thought best for the purpose, after four months close consideration, is an organisation, not in army corps, and not in small divisions such as exist now, of which we could have nine out of the materials we have to keep at home for maintaining our drafts abroad, but six big divisions I am talking of infantry  organised on a pattern to correspond with our forces in India. We think it important to make our Army here accord as nearly and as closely as possible with the organisation in India, in case which Heaven forbid! our forces should have to act together in some great emergency in defence of the Indian frontier upon Indian plains. Therefore the force at which we aim is a force of six big divisions, with the proper equipment of cavalry, which according to the latest war establishment calculations, would be four cavalry brigades for that force. We have more cavalry than that, and I do not cut off a single unit of cavalry. Cavalry is a very valuable and important arm, and we propose to keep our cavalry. Six big divisions of infantry with four cavalry brigades and full artillery would equal three army corps, or nine of the old-fashioned divisions, and represent a total of 150,000 men. These would consist of 50,000 Regulars serving with the colours, 70,000 Reservists, and 30,000 people who are employed and trained on Militia line   that is to say, giving only part of their time for war training  1087 and part for peace, but who are under an engagement to come out on mobilisation. This number falls short of what we are bound to keep in this country for the maintenance of the force we have abroad. We have considered in the Defence Committee to what extent the force abroad could under existing circumstances be reduced. There are troubles in Egypt; things are not wholly clear or settled in South Africa; there are difficulties in various parts of the Empire; and yet, after survey, the Defence Committee is quite clear, and we are quite clear, that we can reduce seven battalions abroad and three battalions at home. The Committee may remember that in the course of the war there were a number of battalions added to the existing regiments so as to improve our strength; these battalions, I think, numbered sixteen or seventeen; but they were reduced, and to-day there are fourteen line battalions which did not exist ten years ago. Of these battalions we are in a position immediately to cut down eight; whether we can cut down some more afterwards depends on considerations of general policy, but I wish in this matter to go cautiously. The Government does not wish to undertake anything they cannot perform and perform with absolute safety. Therefore, we see our way to reduce eight out of the fourteen battalions, and I think in that proposition we are doing nothing extravagant and nothing that will come as a surprise to light hon. Gentlemen opposite. Having reduced these eight battalions, we shall still have to support troops abroad with drafts to an extent which requires a force considerably larger than the regular force which I have indicated. Therefore, when I say we propose to organise a force of six big divisions, amounting to 150,000 men, including Militia men, I am really not increasing the troops which we have had up to the present time available for such a purpose, but I am diminishing them, and by reorganisation I am able to produce a larger amount of units available for organisation. Why is this? Now I come to a mystery, a great mystery, the mystery of the existing condition of our artillery system. Let us see how that stands. Mr. Brodrick, in his letter, said our proposals as 1088 regards the artillery portended a national calamity. That seems to me to show what I came to suspect in the course of the searching investigation which I have had to make into this matter, that the late Government never knew how they stood as regards artillery. You gave the nation new field guns and new horse artillery guns. They are excellent guns. The reports I have on all hands are most satisfactory as to their efficiency. But there is one thing which it does not seem to have occurred to you to give us, and that was men to mobilise them. Would the Committee believe it, out of ninety-three batteries of field artillery which we have at home at the present time, if today we were called upon to mobilise them  there is no secrecy about these figures, I daresay the general staffs of foreign nations have already found them out  you could only mobilise forty-two. Only forty-two out of ninety-three. All these guns would have been delivered complete by the end of the financial year, but your programme of ninety-three complete field artillery batteries, of which we have heard so much, has only resulted in this, that if we went to war at the present time we could only by using our last man put forty-two of them into the field. Why was this? It seems to have been forgotten that the new guns were quick-firing guns, and used a great deal more ammunition than the old-fashioned fifteen-pounders; and the result of requiring more ammunition, of course, is that your ammunition columns have to be longer than is the case at the present time, and require many more men to mobilise. These batteries would have required at the lowest estimate 10,000 more men than you had available for the purpose. I you had provided these 10,000 men upon the Regular basis it would have cos. you something like PS600,000 a year, which was not proposed as part of the artillery reconstruction scheme of the Government. We poor innocents on this side of the House did not know what was going on and the result was that we in our innocence were under the comfortable delusion that we possessed an artillery equipment which would mobilise something approaching ninety-three field batteries of field artillery. The dilemma is either that a mistake was made, or else that His Majesty's late advisers thought  1089 the only field force that they required was a field force equivalent to four of these big divisions of which I have spoken, for four was the utmost amount which the artillery they had available would mobilise, and in that case they certainly cannot object to the very modest reduction which I have proposed in point of view of personnel. My criticisms are grave criticisms, and they are criticisms which I am going to make good in detail; but lest the Committee should say that "" after all, .it is only a civilian who is speaking, and the Government must have had experts at their back,"" let me say that my statements and the figures I give are founded on the most minute investigation made by our General Staff and in the Adjutant-General's Department, and that the figures have been tested and examined at every turn, so that I do not think myself and I have been accustomed to criticise various kinds of business in the course of other avocations that there is the least doubt about them. First of all, assuming that the position is as I have said, how do we stand at the present time? At the present time you have got about 17,000 Regulars to mobilise for your artillery, and 3,000 besides who are unfit, for you do not send men abroad who are under a year's service, or under twenty years of age. Even taking men; who are quite unfit, who have served only: six months, and who are not up to the standard, the position of matters was that. I with your 17,000 Regulars after mobilising; forty-two butteries of field artillery, you would have to use up the last man who was available for ammunition columns; not one other man could have been got, and the remaining fifty-three batteries, therefore, would have been broken up altogether and could not have been used for any purpose. How is that to be got over? I found myself confronted with this very formidable thing, and at first I was appalled at the prospect of having to spend money in creating new additions to the regular force of artillery; but on reflection, and looking about, I made more discoveries. It is a most valuable thing, a survey of the Army as a whole. It is not only the things you are deficient in you find out, but the things that have been uselessly applied to other purposes, and which you can make available to the 1090 end of filling up gaps. I found that, in accordance with principles which had been sanctioned by my predecessors, the theory of our coast defence had been reviewed with the result that a reduction was necessitated of over 300 guns. They had either become obsolete or were not adapted to modern theories of defence. That was the work of the Navy, of the War Office, and of the Defence Committee in conjunction; and as the outcome of it, I found that I had a very large number of Militia-garrison Artillery who wore released from any useful duty, and a somewhat large number of Regulars, approaching 2,000 in addition. That was a very great comfort to me, because I felt I might be able to put the Regular artillery into such a position as to deliver the nation from a national calamity. There were these garrison artillerymen, amounting to somewhere between 13,000 and 14,000. We consulted the Commanding Officers of regiments, and the suggestion that we should use them for this purpose came originally from one of them, Colonel Blake, of the Northumberland Militia  whom I must thank for the great help he has given us, and the many suggestions he has made about this work  and from other Militia artillery colonels, who very reluctantly, seeing the change that has come over their force, have come to the conclusion that it is better that it should assume a newrolethan that it should disappear altogether. We get therefore these 13,000 or 14,000 men, who do not cost us a penny more than at the present time, and we propose to utilise their services for making up that defect in the machine, in the organisation of our field force as a whole, which prevents it from working at the present time. We should be able to get the 10,000 men that are necessary for the ammunition columns, and to get in addition that support which, I need not say, is wholly non-existent at the present time. In that way not only shall we be able to mobilise a very much larger force of artillery than is the case at present, but we shall save a good deal of money on the transaction. Instead of increasing the cost, strange as it may seem, we assume I do not wish to be too sanguine about it we shall be saving PS300,000 a year on what we spend at present.  1091 It would have taken a very large sum to supply material on a Regular basis. The Committee may naturally ask, ""Are you sure that these Militiamen will do their work? "" and my answer is, "" Yes, the General Staff are perfectly sure,"" and I will say why. We believe we can get the class of men we require to assume this new role, and the officers will be content to train them and to make them efficient field artillery Militia, to train them with a view to their ultimately doing the work of the ammunition column part of the organisation of artillery, and going through training which will enable many of them to become skilled gunners and a Reserve for the Artillery if necessary. But we shall go very strongly for this, that every man shall show justification for the money spent upon him; and therefore, if these garrison Militiamen do not take service we shall be bound to say, "" We have no more use for you in maintaining the war organisation of the Army, and we shall spend the money on others who will be willing to take your place,"" and we think we know where we can put our hands on them. But we have no reason to anticipate there will be any large deficiency in the number willing to assume this newrole,and we know if we give them proper training we shall get sufficient men for the ammunition columns. The training of Reserves to maintain the artillery in the field has also to be considered. We are quite clear that for non-commissioned officers, for servers, for layers, for bombardiers, you require a highly trained class of men, not to be obtained from the Militia service; but, like Admiral Fisher's ship, we shall have a nucleus crew which will be supplemented upon mobilisation from the Militia, and in this way we hope on mobilisation to form effective reserve batteries. Let us see how it will work. What will be the strength of the new artillery establishment, and what will be the war establishment? What is the artillery strength of the Great Powers of Europe at this moment? My right hon. friend the Member for the Forest of Dean, who has studied these matters closely, knows that a tremendous controversy is raging in France and Germany as to the right 1092 number of guns for a battery the controversies we have had hero upon religious teaching have been hardly more keen than that abroad upon the number of guns there should be in a battery. That controversy arises out of the fact that the new quick-firing guns consume an enormous quantity of ammunition, and for this reason they cannot be put into the field in such large numbers as in the days of the old slow-firing guns. The result is that France, which has a very fine artillery establishment, has a war establishment of 3*5 guns to every 1,000 bayonets and sabres. Japan has a war establishment of 4*5, and Germany a proportion of 5*5 But Germany is just introducing a new quick-firing gun, and we do not know what the proportion may ultimately be. Great Britain has the proportion of five quick-firing guns to 1,000 bayonets and sabres, and we do not propose to reduce that. Although the gun is a new quick-firing gun we want to be perfectly safe in this all-important arm, and therefore, though it is a more rapid gun, we propose to maintain the live-gun proportion to every 1,000 bayonets or sabres. Starting with this, let us see what the establishment will be in peace and war, respectively. The Committee knows it is always possible to show a considerable saving if in time of peace you resolutely put everything possible into the reserve, so that you are enabled to call up every man at the right time, and so maintain the higher establishment under which you mobilise for war. This is a principle that leads to economy, and it has hitherto partly been applied to the artillery. The General Staff propose to apply it thoroughly, saving money by keeping the batteries on a reserve basis in time of peace. Every nation on the Continent does that. In France the war establishment is five officers on the basis of a four-gun battery; in other ranks a war establishment of 169 and a peace establishment of 129. In Germany they have organised batteries on three scales in time of peace. In an army corps kept on the western frontier there is a six-gun establishment, but that is only one. Germany keeps batteries in time of peace on a three-fold establishment a higher establishment of four guns, and six on mobilisation, with 127 men to five officers; a medium  1093 establishment of 115 men, and a lower of 102 men, officers being the same, and horses in proportion. Now I come to our own ease. We propose to follow the same principle, to keep our six-gun batteries on a four-gun establishment in time of peace, and we likewise propose to have five officers to 117 men rather more than France and sixty horses; France has sixty-one. We propose to keep to ninety-nine batteries, eighty-one on a four-gun basis I will tell the Committee why we come to this conclusion  and eighteen more on a two-gun basis for quite a different purpose. The artillery establishment for a six-division force such as I have described would be sixty-three batteries, and, with the Militia ammunition column s we shall be easily able completely to mobilise that and provide all the drafts required. But in order to help ourselves and to provide, above all, for the training of Militiamen we propose to keep in reserve the remaining thirty-six batteries. We shall bring home six batteries of field artillery from South Africa, which are useless there, and arm them with new guns. I think, having regard to the importance of artillery, to which the Powers are more and more awakening, to which the General Staff are awake, and of which the Army Council is convinced, we ought to encourage the artillery in every way we can consistently. We propose to take the old field guns and, making a new departure, issue them to the Volunteers, who will then have an opportunity of organising themselves into a sort of national artillery reserve. I do not imagine that with such weapons they could take the field against quick-firing guns, but I think this will enable Volunteers to put themselves into a very useful position. These old 15-pounders could be converted at a reasonable cost into quick-firers and made a useful gun; I do not say for the Regular Army, but a good gun, good as some Powers possess, and they will serve the purpose of giving Volunteers the training by which they may become a sort of reserve of national artillery. We take thirty-six batteries of new quick-firing guns for a specific purpose. We want to train 20,000 men of the Militia artillery with these guns; and we propose instead of bringing the people to the guns to take the guns to the 1094 people. Just now the practice is to bring the Northumberland and the Fife Militia for training to Portsmouth. We propose to give the men training nearer their homes, and we shall do this with a little inconvenience and as much elasticity as possible; we do not intend that there shall be a uniform cast-iron rule, to enable them to go through the mill for the ammunition column. Of the thirty-six batteries, eighteen will be on a four-gun basis and eighteen on a two-gun basis. The two-gun basis is better for training; you can train more men, arrangements can be made in such a fashion that you pass more men quickly through the mil1. There are reasons, however, why we must keep eighteen batteries on the four-gun basis; we must provide drafts for abroad. Therefore, from the point of view of training, of supplying drafts, of efficiency and of economy, we take the course I have suggested, we use up the garrison artillery, increase the number of mobilisable batteries to sixty-three, put thirty-six more in the Reserve, with eighteen on a four-gun, eighteen on a two-gun basis, and, increasing the organisation by 50 per cent., we have PS300,000 a year less expenditure. I have only to add that in India and the Colonies we propose to keep the batteries on the six-gun war establishment. We think that will be wiser, because we cannot get reserves out quickly enough in case of emergency. Therefore, in India and the Colonies nothing will be done. There are at the present time of Horse-Artillery in the country fourteen batteries. We do not propose to touch the Horse Artillery. We wish to put it on a four-gun basis in time of peace, and so save a good deal of money, and we have made certain rearrangements at the depots which will result in substantial economy. But we leave the horse Artillery untouched. The proper footing on a war establishment for the force I have described of six divisions is by agreement on all hands ten batteries. There would be a battery for each of the four cavalry brigades, that is the original establishment, and six batteries in addition for the corps  one for each division. So we should use ten batteries and keep four surplus batteries, partly for the purpose of  1095 training and finding drafts, and partly as a reserve of Horse Artillery. The Horse Artillery, is of course, a highly skilled arm and has to be manned almost, if not quite, entirely by Regulars, and therefore the Militia principle of which I have spoken does not apply to them. But I think the savings we have made on the Artillery generally are so substantial that I am not only justified, but I think it is right that I should keep up this arm, which is extremely difficult to train, and which it is impossible to improvise at short notice. Now I think I have put before the Committee the important features of our artillery proposals. I think I am justified in saying that their result is very different from the result anticipated by intelligent calculators who predicted that we were going to ruin the national artillery and put things on a very much worse basis than they were before. Having got my artillery, I now return to the expeditionary force, which I could not complete up to six divisions I think four divisions were all that could be mobilised in the absence of proper artillery at the present time. I will give the Committee the figures which compose the expeditionary force. Speaking from memory I will give the exact figures presently they are something over 154,000 men, of whom some 30,000 will be on a Militia basis, 50,000 Regulars with the Colours, and 70,000 Regular reservists. ' Well, we have for that at home seventy-one battalions of the Line. You must have these battalions, because you have to keep up, after taking off the eight battalions I have described, seventy-seven battalions abroad. There being seventy-one battalions that have to be kept up, in constructing my expeditionary force I have left myself a margin. There may come a time of profound peace or, better still, the nations may resolve to reduce their armaments on a large scale. In that case, and with a view to that possibility, at all events, our object has been to produce a force which you could con tract or expand, and to make it so that in is proportions it could respond accordingly. Therefore we think it right not to organise the expeditionary force up ' to the full limit of the troops we are compelled to keep at home, but to leave ourselves a margin so that, without interfering with the expeditionary force which we 1096 have constructed, you could make in the future, if it were possible to do so in view of things which go far beyond my department, a reduction without impairing the efficiency for war of your field force. Therefore, I say, instead of the whole of my seventy-one battalions of the Line which I have to keep at home, I take only sixty-six of these battalions for the purpose of constructing the expeditionary force. I use in addition six battalions of the Guards I am coming to the Guards a little later making seventy-two battalions of infantry altogether. That gives me five battalions of the Line and a certain number of battations of the Guards surplus. I have four brigades of cavalry on the proper cavalry equipment, that is twelve regiments; and as we have fifteen regiments available I think one has just gone to Egypt, so the number is fourteen at present there is a margin of cavalry in case of necessity. There has been no reduction of cavalry. The artillery I have described; it consists of sixty-three batteries of field and ten batteries of horse, with the surplus which I have described. I should say that in addition to that, as hon. Gentlemen who know the organisation of the Army are aware, there is a certain reserve of guns over and above the guns in these batteries always kept in case of guns getting worn out or destroyed in operations. All these we have preserved. How, then, is it possible for us to get a much larger mobilisation and yet save a great deal of money on it? Before this time the units were there and more units were kept up. We are taking off eight battalions of the Line and two battalions of the Guards. The reason for that I will come to presently. We are taking off, besides, a large number of Regulars who were employed for purposes which, in the opinion of the General Staff, could be amply discharged as they are discharged on the Continent, on a Militia basis. That has enabled us to make a reduction approaching 20,000 Regular soldiers and at the same time mobilise a far larger force. Why? The units were there before, more units than I have left after these reductions. But they could not be mobilised, partly for want of artillery and partly because there were deficiencies in other points,  1097 and it has been so expensive to make things up that the proper provision has not been made. This provision of a Militia basis, which it is easy to keep up, has enabled us to reduce the Regulars in the Army service work, transport, and supply. A great deal of the work done in the field can be done well by Pickford's drivers men who are trained as well as Pickford's drivers and would be also possible combatants in connection with ammunition columns, the Army Medical Service, and a number of other services which it would be easy for me to go into if I were not in a hurry. But I have so much ground to to cover that I will proceed at once to the further details of the organisation of the new force. For this purpose it will probably be for the convenience of right hon. Gentlemen opposite if I give them a spare copy of the table and certain notes which I have; prepared, which show what the composition of the force is. In that way we shall get much more easily to an understanding of the composition; of the new force. If the right hon. Gentlemen will look at the statement on page 3, which is signed by Sir Frederick Stopford, who is responsible, with his experts, for working out this plan, he will find the composition of the force as it has been approved by the Army Council. First of all the total number is 5,546 officers and 154,074 men of all ranks. Those who are on the non-Regular basis  that is to say, who do not require continuous military training, are a certain number of those who are put down as cavalry. By cavalry I mean mounted troops, speaking more accurately. The purpose of the Government, as I have said more than once, has been to go through every department of the Army and ask each man, "" What are you here for? Do you justify the money that is spent upon you? "" If he cannot answer he goes off ruthlessly. If he can make out a case of efficiency for war he remains. We have applied that method to the Regulars, and we also propose to apply it to the Auxiliary Forces, with such modifications as are requisite. For instance there is an admirable force which, I am glad to say, we have been able to turn to good uses, the Yeomanry. We put to them the question, "" Can you furnish us with 1098 what we want? "" We do not want them as mounted infantry, because mounted infantry are to be only a small force on a Regular footing, and I think it is the general opinion that mounted troops pull back the cavalry when sent into action with them. It is as divisional troops with the division that we propose to ask the Yeomanry to act, and they are very willing to provide us with 3,240 men at least. We are not driven to refer to the Yeomanry for that purpose, because, as I have said, we have three brigades of cavalry surplus; but still we should like to use the Yeomanry for this purpose. We want to encourage the best Yeomanry to make this part of the Regular Army on mobilisation; and we hope to use 3,240 mounted men, who will be supplied by the Yeomanry, and who will go with the division and act as divisional troops, hold positions, and perform various other services which mounted men who are fairly trained as rifle shots can do with great advantage. Then in the second column of non Regulars there are 10,337 artillerymen. These are the ammunition columns, of which I have spoken. Then there are engineer services, railway work, telegraph work, and so on, men whom we get in the same fashion. Infantry is left blank for the reasons I will give presently. Army Service Corps, 10,000; Royal Army Medical Corps, Veterinary Department, Ordnance, 30,857 men in all, to be put upon the non-Regular basis. That is the force. Suppose you send it out in its entirety; and suppose you are engaged in a great war, I should be asked, What provision have you made for wastage? My answer is, We have calculated pretty accurately the wastage, and it is appallingly large. The wastage in an average great war is not far short of 80 per cent, per annum. You cannot calculate it at less. For six months you have to calculate for a wastage of 40 per cent., that is to say, of some 56,000 men. And the way we supply that wastage is this, partly out of the surplus people whom we have got and partly out of certain people whom we train on a non-Regular basis, but largely out of infantry, in whose aid we requisition certain existing Militia, with modifications which I shall have, to describe. We have, of course, a considerable number  1099 Infantry of the Line over in the surplus battalions. We also have a surplus of reservists and of young men who, in the first six months of a war, will have matured. These form not only the nucleus, but the greater part. We shal want 9,000 more during the first six months. It is proposed to ask the Militia to furnish them in their units so that we can make them available, not in their battalions at all events in no smaller unit than their company. I will come to that in due course; but I think I have now explained provisionally the composition of the expeditionary force. The reductions in cost in the case of Army reorganisation come, I need not say, from a reduction of thepersonnelof the Regulars, just as in the Navy they come from the reduction of ships. We get our reduction in this way. We get approaching 9,000 men by reducing ten battalions of infantry of different kinds. We get a reduction of Regulars who are employed for garrison artillery purposes which are now obsolete those 300 guns of which I spoke which are coming off our coast defences because our coast defences are organised on quite other principles. There is a reduction there of nearly 2,000 Regulars. Then there are large reductions in the artillery consequent upon supplementing them upon a non-Regular basis and a reorganisation of depots and other matters, amounting to a reduction of about 3,850 men. Then there are a lot of miscellaneous reductions. We have scrutinised everything in every corner, and we have found men redundant too many engineers here, too many Army Service men there, and with a number of minor items which I need not go into now, except to say that they include the Wei-hai-Wei Regiment, and we get, roughly speaking, about 20,000 men. I want to say something to the Committee on which I lay great emphasis. The Committee is urging economy, and I think I have shown them the prospect of good reductions. I do not want to estimate these things in money at this moment for a reason, beyond saying this, that you will see, if I am not very much mistaken, a very handsome and substantial reduction in the next Estimates. 1100 But you will not reap the full fruit, and some of you may be disappointed with the amount, and I will tell you why. Whatever we do there is one thing which I am sure the Committee would not wish. I hate to be the instrument to disband fine battalions of men. I hate, and the Government hate, and we all hate to disturb existing arrangements, and we feel that to every extent that we can, whether we disband soldiers of the line or discharge workmen from factories because munitions of war have not to be made to so great an extent, or whether we reduce staff, we ought to do it as gently as possible so as not to allow the individual to suffer more than we possibly can help. Therefore we propose to act on the policy of making these reductions gradually. Fortunately we are in a, very happy position. I never before had occasion to bless the three years enlistment system which was introduced some years ago and abolished by the late Government. It was a system which failed wholly of its purpose. It was introduced to get over certain difficulties at the time, and the result of it has been to produce a very large Reserve. But that Reserve has been produced by a constant exodus out of the battalions, men coming out because their three years term is over and because they do not want to re-engage, with the result that, while the reserves are large, enormous, at the present time, the battalions have been far under strength. That comes in as the very gift of Providence, so to speak, because it enables me to absorb, fit any rate, a considerable number of the men of the disbanded battalions who may choose to go into them. We do not know who will care to go in and who will not. These things are very difficult to gauge, but we want to help the soldiers in every way we can out of the difficult position in which we are putting thorn. We do not propose to send any man out into the street if we can possibly avoid it, and we think we can provide for all the men and officers by absorption if we only take a little time. We have worked out schemes for that purpose with all the care we can, and I hope the result will be that the, blow, if it falls, as it does fall, on battalions which it has taken many years to bring up to their present, in many cases, admirable  1101 condition, is a blow which will be softened by the merciful measures we are taking. It, of course, retards to a certain extent the immediate fruits of your economy, but, if you give us some months in which to make every man his offer, you will get something very, handsome and substantial, and the rest will lie, notin nubibus,but at a distance of time that you can see and where you can put your hand on the full fruits. So much for the economy side of these reductions. Now I come to what, I am sure, the Committee await a little anxiously to Know: What are the infantry reductions that we propose to make? Which are the ten battalions? I will take first the case of the Guards. Our proposal is to reduce the ten battalions of the Guards by two. The Guards up to 1897 consisted of seven battalions. Three battalions were added, one in 1897, the 3rd Coldstream, and the others in 1899, the 3rd Scots. And when those were instituted Lord Lansdowne, who was then War Minister, stated that  "" it is proposed that of the nine battalions to which the establishment of the Guards will be raised by the creation of two new battalions, three shall be employed on garrison duty in the Mediterranean,"" with a view to relieving the strain on the short-tour battalions. That never came about. The purpose for which these battalions were called into existence was never fulfilled, and the result has been that the Guards have been used for another purpose. They have been used for the purpose of forming a brigade, one of the most admirable brigades in the British Army, at Aldershot. The first question that will be put to me is, "" Why do you not reduce something else than 'the Guards? "" I answer that question by saying because the first consideration is not only efficiency, but efficiency tempered by justice. It would not have been fair, it would not have been possible, to make the whole of the reduction in the infantry of the Line The infantry of the Line are, after all, the battalions which do foreign service work and which feed battalions abroad, and thus for every battalion that I struck out of the infantry of the Line I should have destroyed two battalions that battalion and the battalion it fed abroad. 1102 Consequently I could not reduce, under the present condition of affairs abroad, more battalions of the infantry of the Line, The next question which I came to was this: Did I require these two battalions of the Guards for my expeditionary force, and my answer PSwas clearly I did not. I require only six battalions of the Guards; I had ten I propose, therefore, to reduce two. I could not justify them for the purpose of the expeditionary force, because the expeditionary force requires so many battalions of the Line, and I could not; reduce those battalions of the Line still lower. Nor could I justify, that being so, the proposition to continue spending PS120,000 a year upon those two battalions. I find my occupation, in many respects, a hard one. It requires a; ruthless determination in pursuing a; purpose without looking to the right or to the left, but I must look to the interests of the whole before looking to the interests of the part, and I solemnly say this to the Committee that unless I am free to pursue these things in that way I can neither reorganise the Army on the basis of efficiency for war nor get down the cost of it to an amount which this House and the country will tolerate It is better for the Army, it is better for the Guards themselves, that the Guards should bear their just share of reduction, and that they should be dealt with in this way. I want to say a word about the Aldershot Brigade. I have seen that brigade and learned to admire it, and I should rather not have seen it parted. But, with our reorganisation of the Guards, we shall be able to put Aldershot in just as good a position as it was before. We propose on mobilisation to have two brigades of Guards at Aldershot in the future instead of one, as at the present time. Only one of those brigades will be constantly at Aldershot in peace, and it will be a brigade which trains with two battalions of Guards and two battalions of the Line  a mixed brigade. There are many very distinguished infantry commanders who maintain that a mixed brigade is a more efficient force in war than a brigade of battalions of the Line alone. I see my right hon. friend (Colonel Kenyon-Slaney)  1103 shaking his head. He is a military expert, and I am not; but I will tell him what was said to me just two days ago by a very distinguished general who had gone through the full experience of the thing. He said  "" The old seasoned Linesman, although he may not in some respects be as fine as a picked man of the Guards, is a man with a good deal of experience, and he can teach the Guardsman, when he goes abroad, some things that the Guardsman does not know. I have commanded a mixed brigade, with the result that I think one of the most perfect combinations you could have is Guardsmen and Linesmen in equal proportion."" Acting upon that advice and on other opinions, we have so arranged that I do not think the Aldershot training brigade will suffer much in the future by the system of two battalions of Guards and two of the Line. Every battalion of the Guards will, in the organisation we are working out, go through the mill at Aldershot every fourth year. Moreover, in the Aldershot command, which, in the future, will consist of two of these big divisions, in the second division there will be, on mobilisation, a brigade of Guards organised in peace for the outbreak of war, but not continuously stationed at Aldershot Peace like the mixed brigade which I have just described. I believe that the new organisation will be looked at with a not unfriendly eye by a good many people in the Guards, who feel that the keeping of four battalions at Aldershot constantly imposed a strain which was too heavy to bear. The right hon. Gentleman the Member for Croydon put some questions designed to bring out figures on the subject of the Guards Reserve. I know nothing more absolutely misleading than the calculation which the right hon. Gentleman made which showed that the Guardsman with the average cost of the reservist worked out at a very cheap rate. The figure adopted was PS29 odd, I think. Questions have also been addressed to me the purpose of which is to bring out that the cost of a linesman is very much greater. The comparison is quite misleading. If you take the linesman on the seven and five years enlistment system, taking into consideration that India pays part of the cost of the Reserve, because India pays the cost of the battalion when it is in 1104 service which produces a part of the Reserve, you will find that the average cost of the linesman is very little if at all I different from that of the Guardsman on three years service. The Guardsman is an expensive man, his cost is necessarily rather high. The result is that, looking at the matter from the point of view of efficiency and economy, it is not possible for us to defend the maintenance of the Guards at the strength of battalions to which they were raised since 1897, and the justification of which seems to us to have disappeared. But when you come to what we are to do with them, I am glad to say we shall be able to proceed in such a fashion as, I think, will not injure them any more than can be avoided. We propose to begin with the reduction of the 3rd Scots Guards, taking time for the absorption of the men. Nobody will be deprived of his pay as the process goes on. We shall then proceed with the reduction of the 3rd Coldstream Guards, but there will necessarily be an interval before the reduction takes place. Do not let there be any mistake about this. There is no doubt in our minds about reducing the battalion. Transivit in rem judicatam;we made up our minds that the thing has got to be done; but there will necessarily be an interval of time, and in that interval we propose to ask the Coldstream Guards their third battalion to undertake an honourable and important task, that of relieving a battalion in Egypt. They are a fine battalion, and it is only the necessities which arise from the consideration of the organisation of the Army as a whole that has laid upon us the painful task of reducing them also. I pass from that to the eight battalions of infantry of the Line which we are going to reduce. At the present time this is our position. There are in India fifty-two battalions, there are in the Colonies thirty-two, and at home seventy-two that is to say, there are twelve more battalions at present abroad than there are at home. If eight battalions are to be reduced, we have worked out with the Defence Committee that this is the proper course to pursue and this is entirely approved by the Committee and by the Army and Navy authorities to-bring away three battalions from South.  1105 Africa, replacing them by one cavalry regiment therwant mounted troops there  and, if necessary, another cavalry regiment. That will leave ten battalions in Africa, but not at full strength. We propose, in order to make the ten that remain effective, to use the substance of one of the three battalions to be brought home to be disbanded for strengthening up the other battalions in Africa. There will be ten battalions of infantry instead of thirteen weak battalions, their strength being brought up to 840. There will be an additional cavalry regiment, and another, if necessary, available to go out. In the opinion of my military advisers, that puts South Africa in a better position than at present, because it provides it with a more mobile force. In the next place we propose to make reductions in Malta. The establishment of the battalions there is at present seven, and in the opinion of the Defence Committee it ought not to be more than five. Malta has become more and more of naval and less and less of military importance. It is of use only as a station for troops, and it is not a healthy place. We have decided that one battalion shall come away from Gibraltar, which again is more a naval than a military station, and one will come from Ceylon, where it is not wanted. The result of the whole is that we have to reduce the battalions, which means that we have to bring home battalions from abroad, and select the battalions, which must be of course linked at home, which we can reduce. Now we had to consider what principle we should go on, whether to select battalions from regiments, junior, on sentimental grounds, or to I select them from those regiments for which we had been unable to obtain the necessary recruits and bring them up to the establishment. We decided unanimously to go for numerical efficiency and not sentimental considerations   that we should reduce the battalions inefficient in point of I strength and that being so, we had to determine which. This is the decision of the Government: The third and fourth battalions of the Northumberland Fusiliers, the third and fourth battalions of the Royal Warwickshire Regiment, 1106 the third and fourth battalions of the Lancashire Fusiliers, and the third and fourth battalions of the Manchester Regiment. All these regiments are very largely short. The terms of enlistment are very important, and we have given close consideration to that. As the Committee I knows, Mr. Cardwell originally proposed in the short service scheme as it first stood, that the terms should be six years with the colours and six with the reserve. Afterwards it became seven and five. Then there was the unfortunate three years experiment, with nine, from which a jump had to be made to the other end nine and three, to increase the men with the colours. That is too large, in our opinion, and after very great consideration the Adjutant-General, to whom I cannot express my obligations sufficiently deeply for the immense amount of work; he has thrown into this part of my proposals, has presented me with these recommendations, which are adopted by the Army Council and the Government. The terms of enlistment for the infantry of the Line will be, as a general rule, seven and five, with the extra year. The Guards will remain three and nine; they do not go abroad. The cavalry will be seven and live, with the extra year necessary; no change. The field and horse artillery, instead of being three and nine, will be six and six. The garrison artillery will be eight and I four. What we want is to get highly-trained Reserve men. I have stated that we propose to reduce the Irish Guards, which was a battalion of colossal proportions, from 920 rank and file to 820. The cavalry we do not touch, nor do we I touch the Household Cavalry. The Infantry of the Line establishment, 805 non-commissioned officers and men, can be well reduced to 775, but one cannot go below that, otherwise one would not get the drafts; and even then that is above the average actual strength at the present moment. The result of the whole process is that, whereas we have now 156' battalions of the Line, of which fifty-two are in India, thirty-two in the colonies, and seventy-two at home, we shall have fifty-two in India, twenty-five only in the colonies, and seventy-one at home, making 148 in all. That is  1107 where I get my reduction. With regard to the Reserve, which is very large, we propose this year to close the entrance to Section D. I have put before the Committee the full effect of the reductions, and I want to pass on to another topic which intimately concerns the soldier, We have gone with great care in the last few months into the question of how we I can find some employment for the soldier in a more systematic fashion after he leaves his profession, and how we can best teach him a trade, and generally improve his material position. I do not I think we can lay too much stress on the proposition that it is important that we should get quality as well as quantity. The reductions will enable us to put forward a higher standard of quality than, we have hitherto been able to enforce, and we hope, to accompany that by an effort to make the social condition of the soldier better than it is at the moment. For that purpose Sir E. Ward undertook to I preside over a committee which has sat' unremittingly on the whole question, and that committee has presented a Report which has been laid on the Table, and will be printed and issued in a few days. It contains a vast amount, of material and a number of propositions, many of which, at any rate, we hope to be able to carry into effect. It will require a good deal of work, and Sir E. Ward and his colleagues propose to take it in hand as soon as the Report is laid. Then there is another point of vital importance, the health of the Army. There have been some reproaches in the papers that we have been saying nothing about sanitary reform in the Army and the improvement of our medical system. It is not a subject; which, connected intimately as I am through family ties with medicine and science, I am likely to have neglected, and I am glad to say I have had working for me in this direction Sir Alfred Keogh, Surgeon-General, and the head of the Medical Department of the Army, than whom there is no more skilled man anywhere. He has provided a scheme which is already partly in operation, and I propose to deal with the health of the Army in this fashion. It is ' all part of our organisation for war, which I am going to detail in a few words. We 1108 propose, on the outbreak of war, to treat the Army on the basis of looking after the health of the unit as one thing, and the health of the base and lines of communication as another thing. The chief sources of disease are contact with infection, imperfect disposal of excreta,and impure water supply. All those things are being separately dealt with. Small things in themselves, they multiply the evils to enormous dimensions when dealing with great bodies of troops. First of all, field army conditions are quite different from those of the base and line of communications, and therefore it is necessary that there should be systematic teaching, not only of medical officers, but of the combatant officers, in order to enable them to apply the best results of medical science to the preservation of the health of their units. Our medical training we propose very largely to improve. We have already taken the decision to make the instruction of officers include health matters and medical matters as far as they bear on the health of their companies, as well as other matters. We propose to give instruction not only to the officers but to the men. The Medical Department has prepared a manual of instruction for the soldier, and henceforth it is to be the duty of the company officer not only to read and understand that manual himself, but also to see that his men read and understand it. We have also provided a medical school at Aldershot which is now training our medical officers. When we organise for war it is intended that the unit of organisation I shall consist of one medical officer, one non-commissioned officer, and four men; of the Army Medical Corps, who will have to look after the water supply and other such services; and one commissioned officer who will supervise the sanitary police duties. These men will be trained at the new school of hygiene at Aldershot. A line of communication will be organised for the preservation of health and the prevention of disease on something like the organisation of a civil community. It is intended to form sanitary sections who will not have to attend to the sick, but to look after the health of the troops and the prevention of disease. There will also be a general sanitary commission who, working at  1109 the base, will provide for requirements as they crop up. In that work the combatant officer and the medical officer will be brought together. We think they cannot be in too close a communication. Of course, for skilled medical work, we look to the trained medical officer. But there is a great deal of other medical service which can only be attended to by the authority of the combatant officer. We have learned a great deal in this matter from the Japanese; but we have learned a great deal more from the studies of our own people themselves. They have worked out the problem of how to purify water by a new system of filtration. We have arranged at Aldershot for a regular sanitary campaign on lines as it would be carried out in war. The water there will be declared impure  which is a great farce, as Aldershot is excellently supplied with water and the water will be brought from a new source of supply in order to see how our organisation would work out in war. I believe we shall have as good a medical service as any in the world, if not better, and have it with something in the way of economy. We are able to reduce the provision of hospital accommodation in war from 10 to 7 per cent., which is a substantial economy. I have now said what I have got to say on the subject of the Regular Forces. I will deal shortly with the subject of the Auxiliary Forces, for I am ashamed of having engaged the attention of the Committee so long. His Majesty's Government have deemed it to be their duty to put to the Auxiliary Forces precisely the same question as they have put to the Regular Army. That is  "" What purpose do you serve in war? "" But before I enter upon this branch of my subject, I want the Committee to understand the difficulties which confront the reformer right through the whole organisation of the Army. There has been a want of plan, a want of method; and things have grown up like mushrooms haphazardly, you do not know how or why. It is not only in regard to the Regulars that great wastage has taken place; it has taken place also in the Auxiliaries, and. you come across it even in departments where you least expect it. One would have thought that 1110 in regard to the food supply of the Regular Army things would be closely looked into. About two months ago I found a contract for the supply of meat in which it was said that the meat must be home bred. I know that I am now touching on a dangerous topic, in which members from Ireland take a great interest. Well, I thought the condition about home-bred a little awkward, so I myself struck it out and put in "" home-killed "" instead. That has been in operation for two months Two results have ensued from it. One was a comfort not to the home-breeder but to myself. That was that we have saved a farthing on every ration, or PS50,000 a year, which is a neat little economy to effect on a meat contract on free-trade principles. The other result was that I discovered from my experts that the Army got very little home-bred meat, that the meat they got came not from Ireland, or from anywhere at home, but from Australia, Canada, the Argentine and other countries, whence it was brought to the port of Liverpool, slaughtered there in very large quantities, and sold as home-bred meat. I have therefore the best evidence for believing that the change has not really been to the detriment of the constituencies of hon. members from Ireland; and at the same time we have saved PS50,000 a year. That is only a simple illustration of the little reforms you can carry out. The Exchequer has a right to demand full value for the money it spends on the Army. Remember that the cost of the Regular soldier has risen from PS49 3s. in the Estimates of 1896-7 to PS66 18s. in the Estimates of 1906-7; PS13 of that increase is due to additional pay. There has been a very large increase also in the cost of the Auxiliary Forces. The Militia, which in the ten years has fallen from 113,000 men to 90,000, costs PS480,000 a year more. The Yeomanry has increased in numbers from 9,600 to 25,000, at an enhanced cost of PS420,000 a year. The Yeomanry are a very useful and valuable force, but we must put to them the question What service can you render us in time of war? The Volunteers have gone up in cost in the ten years to PS6 10s. per man. To them likewise we lave to put the question, What services san you render us in time of war? I am  1111 sure the Committee will pity the War Minister when he comes to deal with the financial side of the problem which faces him. . There are automatic increases of expenditure of large amount arising out of things done in years past with which he has had nothing to do; and at the same time he is face to face with the duty of keeping down the Estimates. Still, it can be done, but in endeavouring to cope with that task I think he is entitled to ask for indulgence and consideration if he can not accomplish everything as quickly as ' may be desired. With these few preliminary observations, which I think are necessary to justify my position in regard to the Militia, I put to the force the question, What purpose do you fulfil in war at the present time? The Militia in old days were raised by ballot, which was compulsory  except in cases where the ballot was suspended and were for service at home. Even if the ballot were made compulsory everywhere the Militia to-day would not be under any obligation to take part in operations beyond the seas; and if the force is to remain on that basis I could not conscientiously advise the Chancellor of the Exchequer to continue to spend upon them the money he is spending at the present time. The Militia must have a new function assigned to them in the organisation of the Army as a whole. They must either fall hack into Volunteer work, in which case they would not be paid any more than the Volunteers are paid; or else they must lake upon themselves the same obligation as the Regular soldier, and that is to be ready to serve abroad in time of war. In time of peace they stay at home. But in time of war they can be of no use to us unless they form an efficient first line of support to the Regular Army in the field. It is, therefore, clear that we must ask the Militia to form a first line of drafts for the Regular Army in the field, and therefore to accept the obligation of going abroad in time of war. There are two schools of thought with regard to the Militia. One, which is represented by the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Croydon, says the Militiaman is but an imperfect conception of what a short-service soldier ought to be. Therefore, make him a real short-service soldier. The other 1112 school says what you should do with our old constitutional force is to extend them enormously, so that they shall be not merely a support to but an expansion of the Regular Army. This school looks to the Lords - Lieutenant to give a now life to the Militia. The Lords-Lieutenant cannot discharge that function. For such a purpose they are as dead as the dodo. I believe new life can be given to them, and that new functions may be assigned to them if they are surrounded by representatives of the more democratic and vigorous elements of the country, who may help them to discharge administrative duties connected with the Army. I do not propose, nor do we desire, to destroy the constitutional position of the Militia at the present time. You can keep them a county force and yet make a great step forward. Mr. Cardwell's great idea was, behind the two Regular battalions, the two territorialised battalions, to have a third Militia battalion. Behind that he wished to have depot battalions which would be available on the outbreak of war, looked after by officers probably who were retired, but who would be called; back on the outbreak of war. Into those; depot battalions all surplus elements could go, but between that and the second Regular battalion he desired to place the Militia battalion of the county. Well, the policy of the Government is to carry out Mr. Cardwell's principle, to make a closer connection between the Militia battalions and the Regular battalions than exists at present. The Militia have to elect between going into the condition of Volunteers and coming nearer to the Regular forces. What we are anxious to do is to take the Militia battalions and make them battalions of the Regular Army, to give its officers as nearly as possible Army rank, to place it in a better position as regards training, to raise its strength, and generally to make it much more efficient. We propose to take the 124 battalions of Militia we have now, to review them, to lop off weak battalions and to consolidate them, so as to make more efficient battalions, and to put behind every Regular battalion of the home Army a third or Militia battalion. In some cases there may be more than one Militia battalion, two, or even  1113 three, where the Militia are strong, which will put a first line of Reserve behind the Regular Army. The men will go abroad in units not lower than companies, and often in battalions, with their own officers, so that they may have the feeling that they are going out with their own officers to the regiments to which they are affiliated. I know there are many of the Militia who demur from that, and wish the force to be rather an extension than a reserve for the Army; but, on the other hand, the Army take very strongly the view that the average Militia battalion is not fit, and cannot be made fit, to be put into the field against the Regular troops of the Continent. It is felt that the first fighting line must be filled by the trained battalions of the Regular army. As the Militia become fit they can take the place of companies cut up in the Regular regiments to which they are affiliated. That will ensure the Regular Army taking an interest in their Militia battalions. Further than that we cannot go. It is impossible for this Government to spend money unless they can justify the expenditure. We hope gradually to get the Militia into shape. Valuable experiments have been made lately in Militia training, and we are making experiments ourselves which may lead to modifications in the mode of training the Militia, so as to make them better suited to the exigencies of different districts. It is upon that principle we propose to act. Of course that will be a gradual process, and we hope in that fashion to get the Militia into shape. Valuable experiments have been made lately in Militia training. We are making experiments which may lead to amplifications in the mode of training the Militia so that we may get hold of them more effectually and in a fashion that better suits the exigencies of different districts. The Militia Artillery must disappear as garrison artillery and in a now capacity be drawn nearer to the Regular field artillery. Now I come to the Volunteers. The same question exactly we put to the Volunteers. We say, ""What useful function do you fulfil   because you are costing the country PS1,700,000 a year, money we do not grudge if you are 1114 fulfilling a necessary function."" Now the Volunteers have definite functions which they ought to fulfil, and which to a large extent they do fulfil. If the nation went to war the Regular troops would go out of the garrison forts, which would then have to be defended by the Volunteers. The Volunteers are also required to repel possible raids to the extent of about 10,000 men. I think such raids very unlikely, because I believe the raiders would never go back alive. There may, however, be some Power which would be enterprising enough to lose 10,000 men in order to destroy the Elswick works or Woolwich Arsenal. They will find it very difficult, but still possible, and provision has to be made accordingly, and that is the second function which Volunteers have to fulfil. There is a third function which the Volunteers may have to fulfil, and that is to be a sort of second Reserve for the Regular Army. We propose to take the Volunteers and organise them for these three functions. For the first two namely, the defence of the naval fortresses and the repelling of raids it is estimated by the general staff that 140,000 infantry Volunteers, 9,000 garrison Volunteers, and 8,000 mounted men from the Yeomanry will be required. But at the present time everything is in a state of confusion. The Volunteers who have to defend the naval fortresses are often brought very great distances. The regions in which naval fortresses exist do not produce the kind of Volunteer who is wanted to defend them. We propose to survey the whole of Great Britain to determine the functions which the Volunteers should have to perform in each district and county, and to say to them, "" What we requisition you for is this particular kind of service you, men of Hampshire and the Southern counties, you have to defend the great southern Naval forts."" In the Eastern counties there are unguarded portions of the coast, and we may say to the men in those districts, "" You must produce in each district Volunteers of the type required for the defence of the coast."" In other counties we may say, "" We want you as infantry of the line or as mounted men."" To other places we may say, "" We should like you to take the field guns and train yourselves as a reserve of Volunteer artillery'."" In that way we  1115 hope to get value for our money out of the Volunteers. I have talked a good deal to Volunteer commanding officers on this very important subject and they have said to me, almost with one voice, ""Do not have any hesitation in making this demand upon us. We Volunteers have been longing, for years past, to have real functions and to be freed from sham. Make one national Army, not regular and auxiliary forces, but one entire force."" Speaking from such information as I have been able to get, I do not entertain much doubt that the Volunteers will respond to what we ask of them, and will say, "" We are only too glad to find ourselves with real functions."" It will be observed that the working out of all this requires great care and minute local knowledge. How are you to get the Volunteers and the number of Militiamen required for these special services of which I have spoken? You cannot get them through the War Office. The War Office has broken down as a means of reorganising the Volunteers. The result is that battalions grow up haphazard. We must have county associations of some kind or sort. I start with the principle that unless you give some kind of Home Rule to the Volunteers you will not get efficient service."	175.0	1906.0	1900	[('full', 'full', ['positive', 'JJ']), ('confined',
