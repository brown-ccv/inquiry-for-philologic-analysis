2946	2946		1805-05-23		Mr. Serjeant		"Mr. Serjeant Best. I rise, sir, to call the attention of the house to a subject, perhaps one of the most important to its own privileges that has ever been agitated within these walls. From the eleventh report of the commissioners of naval enquiry, it appears, that enormous sums of the public money have been raised by loans, and disbursed for alledged services, by order of his majesty's ministers, without the permission of this house, and without any account laid before parliament of such disbursements. Sir, knowing, as we do, the opinion of the public without doors, expressed from every part of the nation, of the laudable vigilance exerted by the commissioners of naval enquiry, to whom other abuses have,been referred for investigation, and feeling, as we must, from recent abuses in the expenditure of public money, the necessity which exists, in times like the present, for exerting, with the utmost vigilance, the peculiar privilege which it is the province and the duty of this house at all times to exercise over the public finances; yet, in calling the attention, of the house to this subject,. I do not mean they should pronounce judgment against the parties implicated, upon the mere evidence of the report itself; for although the facts stated therein may have been proved to the satisfaction of the commissioners, and we have every reason to rely on their veracity, still I am inclined to think, the house, before it proceeds to, any measures against the parties implicated, ought to go into the enquiry; and this will be the object of the motion which I shall have the honour of proposing this day. Sir, it cannot be necessary for me to remind the house, that it is the bounden duty of parliament to watch over our constitution, and to take care that no inroads are made upon it by any minister, or any set of men; and more especially that part which comes so peculiarly under We auspices of the house of commons, namely, the security of the public purse. Sir, it is impossible for any man to look at, the facts stated in the report on your table, any more than at those other facts of a similar nature, that have come under your consideration, and not to see that the grossest abuses have been committed; and that scarcely any law has been passed for   57 the security of our constitution on those points, that has not been violated. I know not if it will be disputed, whether money can be raised and disbursed in this kingdom, for the service of the crown, without the consent of parliament; but that large sums of money have been so raised and disbursed, we have seen from recent and undeniable facts. It, therefore, becomes highly necessary to ascertain whether loans of money can be raised from the people by the ministers of the crown, without the consent of parliament, consistently with the principles of the British constitution; because scarcely a session of parliament passes without one or more votes enabling the minister to raise loans for the state upon exchequer bills; and if it be the law of the constitution that loans cannot be raised upon exchequer bills, without that permission, it certainly cannot be legal to issue navy bills for the purpose. But though I may entertain no hopes of success in the motion which it is my purpose to offer, it is my duty to bring it forward, and at least to state to the house what former parliaments have done in similar cases, and what opinion they entertained of the power of ministers to raise public loans without their permission. It appears by a resolution of the house, passed on the 7th of June, 1680, that if any person whatsoever should issue exchequer bills, or other government securities, for the purpose of raising sums of money for the service of the crown, without the consent of parliament, he shall be responsible to parliament; and in other resolutions, the same principle is directed against any person who shall purchase tallies by anticipation. But, sir, another principle is, that it must be obvious government cannot raise loans from the public, without the. consent of this house: for if this house were once to admit such a principle, or pass such a measure unnoticed, it would,not only, surrender the most valuable of its privileges, but every other privilege it has obtained, with that would speedily follow. A learned writer upon the constitution of this country (Millar) has said, that it has so guarded every avenue and passage, by wich the prerogative could invade our rights, that the crown cannot raise any loan or supply of public money without the consent of this house, and is, therefore, obliged the more frequently to call meetings of parliament, being unable to levy any money without their interven- 58 tion. I shall quote another instance, which occurred shortly after the revolution, to prove how jealous the parliament was, in those days, of their privileges on this point. The instance to which I allude, is that of the Bank act, which, in express terms, debars the government from borrowing loans of money, even from the directors of the Bank, without the consent of parliament: and is it probable, I ask, that government should be prohibited from borrowing money from the Bank, and be left at liberty to raise loans from others? The fact is, that the restriction in the Bank act was made on account of the connection existing between government and the Bank, and to guard against the probable influence of the former over the latter, and the consequent facility of procuring thence loans of money. But, sir, it never could have entered into the apprehension of the framers of that act, that ministers might be at liberty to go into the city and search from one street to another to raise money by the aid of brokers. In fact, the reason why they confined the restriction so peculiarly to the Bank was, that they never once suspected any other means would be resorted to. My object therefore is to shew how such evils have been guarded against by the constitution. No member of this house, who lived within fifty years of the revolution; could have conceived that any minister of the crown, or any government in this country, would have ventured to adopt the measures in this way which we have seen practised within the last few years, and passed by without any enquiry. Even since the year 1800, independently of the vast number of navy bills that have been issued in the only legal way they ought to have been issued, namely, for stores and actual services; and which becoming due, instead of being paid off, were taken up by issuing other navy bills, as has of late been the practice at the Bank, no less a sum than 4,300,000l. have been raised by the issuing of navy bills; and of this no communication was ever made to parliament. It appears, page 513 of this report, that on the 2d October, 1802, a letter was written by the secretary of the treasury to the comptroller of the navy directing him to issue navy bills for the sum of 500,000l. for the purpose of raising that sum. One would imagine, by the frequent and familiar use of this kind of resource, that instead of his majesty trusting to the house as the   59 proper channel for granting supplies, it was only necessary to issue a letter from the secretary of the treasury to authorize the raising of enormous sums upon navy bills. But, sir, my objection goes equally to small sums as well as large; because if you admit a small sum to be thus raised to-day, a large one will be raised in like manner to-morrow. In the process of a little time, any sum, however enormous or unnecessary, may be raised by the crown, without the consent of this house. In this case, sir, it appears, that the order from the treasury issued on the 24th of October; on the 10th of November the money was raised; parliament sat the very next day, yet no communication whatever was made to this house. It is unnecessary for me to state what would have been the opinion of parliament in other times upon a proceeding of this sort. It is however clear, that the enormous sum I have stated has been raised without any application for the assent of the house of commons. It is sufficient for me to say, that this sum was raised at periods, during great part of which parliament was sitting; and that no communication whatever was made. Now, sir, if it be not lawful for the government to raise money without the consent of parliament, will any man say this transaction is legal? What, I ask, is the pretence to justify it? State-necessity will, I allow, at times arise, that may authorize such conduct in a minister; but it cannot prevail for two years together, nor supersede the duty of communication to parliament. As the acts stands, it is illegal. All I ask, then, is, for the house to go into the enquiry, and let it be for those gentlemen on the other side of the house to shew the existence of any state-necessity, not by statements here, but by regular evidence before a committee. By law the crown is restricted from borrowing money for any purpose, even for paying debts, without the consent of parliament; and here no new circumstance appears, for which a minister could not have been prepared to justify the measure upon the ground of exigency. But, sir, there is another circumstance of which I complain still more than of that which I have stated: for though I feel that, on the part of ministers, standing in the situation they do, it was a high violation of the law of the country, as I understand the report (and I shall be glad to find I have misunderstood it);  60 from the explanation I shall this day receive (I allude to the manner in which they have paid away the money, and which, in my mind, is still more reprehensible than the mode of raising it); it was surely their duty to have submitted the whole of the circumstances under which they acted to parliament, and the proof of necessity would have obviated all objections to complete indemnification. In page 449 of the Report, you find, by the question put to sir Andrew Snape Hamond, and his answer thereto, that those bills were issued for the purpose of raising money, and not for stores furnished, or actual services rendered, which would have been the only legal ground; and in the next statement you find them stated as bills regularly issued for stores received and services rendered. This, sir, was a most gross imposition upon the house; for instead of being issued to discharge debts to come due in the course of the current year, they are appropriated to pay the debts of former years; and those are circumstances which, if parliament had not been imposed on, it would never have sanctioned or consented to such a violation of its own privileges. Such a conduct, sir, I submit, was in the highest degree reprehensible, and if such attempts to impose on the house, by the production of false vouchers or false returns, be permitted, the consequence must be to destroy all confidence in the accounts stated by ministers. No transaction can be more repugnant to law: possibly it may be explained away a but until I have other proofs, I must agree with the opinion expressed by the commissioners in their report, that they see no reason why there should have been any departure from the usual form of proceeding, and resort had to such measures as these; measures which, I believe, would never have been discovered, but would have remained for ever concealed from the house, had it not been for the talents and vigilance of the commissioners of naval enquiry. If it was possible that any such state-necessity could exist for two years, what becomes of the boasting statements made during that time to this house? For, instead of the country being in that miserable state of exigency which called for such desperate expedients, the right hon. gent. constantly stated, in pompous language, that we had abundant resources to carry on the war in which we were enga-  61 ged. Whereas, it would now appear, we were in a state of poverty. I can suggest but one of two reasons that could actuate any minister in such a case; namely, that either his estimates must have been short of the proper amount, or a part of the money voted for naval services must have been employed for the purposes of the army, or some other service; and this too would be another instance of violation of the law, which strictly forbids the application of money, voted for one purpose, being appropriated to any other. How has it happened that money was not provided, when the navy bills are issued at three months, and therefore could not come by surprize? Sir, I think I have proved that there is ground to charge his majesty's ministers in this case with a violation of the law, a misapplication of the public money, and a gross deception upon this house; and unless the right hon. gent. can chew that I have. totally mistaken that report, and justify his own conduct, it must be plain that he has violated the constitution. At all events, I have shewn enough to prove the necessity of going into enquiry. I have to complain, in the next place, of another violation of law, in taking from under the control of the lords of the admiralty those transactions, for the success or failure of which they only are responsible, and transferring them to that of the secretary of the lords of the treasury, who have no more to do with them officially than the lord chancellor. Sir, I will say, that any commands so given to any naval officer, not sanctioned by the first lord of the admiralty, ought not to have been obeyed. It has been settled by an order of council, as appears in page 499, that all naval juries must be directed by the lords of the Admiralty, and any difference of opinion be ultimately subject to the control of the first lord; all navy contracts, except for secret service, must be made under his direction. You will find, that 100,000l. has been raised by navy bills, for secret service, by the same illegal mode. But it must be obvious, that navy bills cannot be legally issued for secret services; the proper fund provided by law for secret services being the civil list, under what is called the civil list act. And the right hon. gent. who introduced that bill, so framed it, because he knew no other proper source, as ministers were responsible to parliament for all sums voted them for specific service, but not for secret ser-  62 vice; and therefore it could not be supplied from any suns for the appropriation of which ministers are responsible. What security then has the house for the disposal of such money? not even the oath of the minister, as in the case of such service; nothing but a mere assertion; in which case, I beg to ask whether parliament can be said to have any control at all? But if this is the sort of quietus by which a minister is to cover the expenditure of such a sum as 95,000l. in one instance stated to be paid to a man whose name even is not mentioned, and 16,000l. in another, for services of too delicate a nature, forsooth, to be disclosed even to the commissioners of enquiry, I know not to what extent profusion and irresponsibility may travel pari passu. But his majesty's ministers, not satisfied with violating the law, violate even the rules laid down by themselves. If, however, the commissioners of the navy, and those of naval enquiry, are men not fit to be entrusted with such confidence, they are unworthy of their offices, and ought to be dismissed. I admire, however, this fastidious delicacy, which can disburse such sums as 95,000l. in one instance, and 16,000l. in another,. without even a memorandum of the mode of expenditure, while the latter turns out to be the ever memorable stone expedition, known to every waterman on the river long before it was attempted, in vain, to be,carried into effect. Having now, sir, stated to the house, the ground of my motion, I. do not call upon it to pronounce judgment. We stand upon a different footing from that of a former night, when you, sir, by your decision, did so much honour to yourself and the high and important station you fill. There our judgment was warranted by Ow: admission of the party accused; but here, we have no such ground to go upon The house, however, is called upon to investigate, and the right hon. gent. has told us that he will not oppose any investigation, as far as it goes towards his own conduct; but whether it is his pleasure or not, it is not, for us to enquire. It is our duty to investigate. We owe it to the country. His majesty's ministers may, perhaps, make out a case for their own justification, but they are bound to govern the country, not only wisely and justly, but according to law. I have in my hand an old statute of William III. which lays it down as an indispensable maxim, chat all kings and queens, who assume the government of this   63 country, shall be bound to administer it according to the laws of the land, and not by their own will, caprice, or private judgment; and that no minister shall be allowed to depart from this law with impunity. Sir, it was objected to the motion of an hon. friend of mine (Mr. Fox), for the emancipation of the catholics the other night, that it could not be granted, because it was contrary to the established law of the state, and might endanger the constitution. I hope, sir, the same srcupulous regard for that law and that constitution, will operate also in this case, and that no minister will be allowed to violate either. I shall now move you, sir, ""that a select committee of this house be appointed to take into consideration the eleventh report of the commissioners of naval enquiry, and report their opinions thereon to the house."""	-13.0	1805.0	1800
27160	27160	S1V0037P0-00595	1818-02-17	MOTION RESPECTING THE PETITIONS COMPLAINING OF IMPRISONMENT UNDER THE HABEAS CORPUS SUSPENSION ACT.]	Lord Folkestone		"Lord Folkestone moved, that the Petitions of Francis Ward, William Benbow, John  461 Knight, Samuel Haynes, Joseph Thomas Evans, William Ogden, John Stewart, and John Bagguley,* who had been imprisoned under the act for the Suspension of the Habeas Corpus, praying the House to investigate the treatment which they had received, should be entered as read, which was done accordingly. His lordship then proceeded to observe, that when he presented the petition of Francis Ward to the House, he had stated that he should afterwards move to have that and the other petitions, presented on the same subject, referred to a committee of the House, when they might take into their consideration all the circumstances detailed in those petitions. He was anxious, as early as possible, to bring this case before the House, because it had been intimated, by a noble lord, that a bill of indemnity to the servants of the Crown would be asked for as a matter of course; that the question was to be brought forward, not for the grave and serious discussion of the House, not as a measure that was to depend on its own merits, and to be rejected or approved as the conduct of his majesty's ministers should warrant; but as a measure which the ministers were entitled to demand of the House, and which the House, in its legislative capacity, could not refuse. It appeared to him, that a strange confusion prevailed in the minds of several persons with respect to that bill. They seemed to think, that it' was really due to the ministers of the Crown, as the noble lord had stated, without any previous investigation; but if he knew any thing of the principles of our constitution, he would be bold to say, that it was the duty of the House, on this occasion, to take care, not so much of the ministers of the Crown, as of the liberties of the people. Before they suffered themselves to give any countenance to a bill of indemnity, they should see that the people had not been damnified: they should first appoint a committee to examine the grievances which the petitioners had stated, and to ascertain whether the ministers had not exceeded their powers. Nothing could be more hostile to the spirit of liberty, nothing more destructive of that generous system which our forefathers had delivered down to us, than the doctrine that a bill of this nature should be passed as a matter of course.  * For copies of the said Petitions, see p. 104, 192, and 412. 462 The Habeas Corpus act had, within the last hundred and twenty-four years, been frequently suspended no fewer than nine, ten, or twelve times; but these suspensions had been followed by a bill of indemnity only on one occasion, and it was curious that that bill of indemnity was asked by the same gentleman who now asked for one; for though they did not occupy the same situations which they now occupied, it was the same individuals who applied then that applied now. So that the only instance of a bill of indemnity was a precedent of their own: they acted wrong in the first instance, and now they thought to benefit by their own wrong: they were calling upon the House to screen them from the consequences of their late violations of the law, merely, as they stated, because they had been protected from such consequences before! But he wished to observe to the House, that bills of indemnity, in cases of suspension of the Habeas Corpus act, were altogether of modern date he had taken some pains to look into the proceedings of parliament, and he could find no precedent earlier than the 40th of the present king. It was always to be borne in mind, that the House had yet had no satisfactory proof of the necessity for vesting ministers with the extraordinary powers which the suspension of the Habeas Corpus had conferred on them. When they applied to the legislature for the bill by which this was effected, they asserted, that sedition and treason prevailed in several counties, and that the ordinary powers of the law were not sufficient to repress them. This was the ground upon which they desired to be intrusted with extraordinary powers. But what had been the result? The only instance which could at all be adduced of any outrage having arisen from the evil spirit which was said to prevail was, the frame-breaking at Derby and Nottingham, followed by the trials for high treason at Derby, where three individuals suffered the punishment of the law. No gentleman had shown that any other case of treason had been found to exist. It was evident, therefore, that the dangers of the country had been exaggerated beyond their proper dimensions; and that they might have been removed, had government taken a different course from that which they had pursued. But as to the manner in which ministers had exercised their powers, the very fact of their asking a bill of indemnity was an  463 admission of their having abused them. From the beginning to the end of the business, it seemed to him that they had violated the law in every respect; and he was at a loss to know how gentlemen would justify themselves in the eyes of their constituents in what manner they could reconcile it to their, own consciences to grant an indemnity under such circumstances. It was admitted on all hands, that ministers had received, by the Suspension act, no new powers of apprehension and release they had only received the additional power of retaining persons arrested, without bringing them to trial, beyond the term fixed by law for that purpose. They had no new power of taking up persons without warrant issued in the usual manner. There was a regular form and process in which only men could be arrested; they ought to know the accusation against them, and to be themselves examined. This was the case with respect to every inferior crime the subject was regulated by law-books and by acts of parliament. Not one of the regular forms had been complied with in the present case. He would not at present dispute the power of the secretary of state to issue warrants to apprehend persons on a charge of high treason; but he must observe, that this power, said to be vested in the secretary of state, was undoubtedly an anomaly. It was a usurpation, and not above a hundred and fifty years old. It had been disputed at the time of the Revolution, and it was only by a decision in the time of king William that it was confirmed. One of the judges declared on that occasion (as appeared by sir Benjamin Shower's Reports), that he conceived the secretary of state had power to administer an oath, because he had power to commit. It would have been a much more legitimate conclusion, to have inferred that he could not commit, because he could not administer an oath. Lord Camden said, he founded his opinion entirely on that decision. But, as he had already said, he did not now mean to dispute the power of the secretary of state to commit. It was a right, however, of modern practice, which some of the greatest lawyers had pronounced to be a usurpation, and a perfect anomaly and if that power was continued, they ought to put an end to the anomaly by giving a power to the secretary of state to administer an oath. But if the secretary of state had ++ 464 the power to issue warrants to apprehend persons on a charge of high treason, he ought not to do this without attending to certain forms. He did not find any statute or any other guide to determine the form to be gone through, before the secretary of state could issue such warrant; but he could not doubt that the same forms ought to be observed in cases of high treason, which were used in the case of all inferior crimes; and he knew that the forms of proceeding, in the case of inferior crimes, were pointed out and directed by law. A justice of peace, before committing, in the case of inferior crimes, must take the examination of the party, and the oath of the accuser, and transmit them to the proper court where the person so committed would have to be tried. Was the law to take all these precautions in the case of inferior crimes, and to be blind in the case of higher offences? and was the secretary of state to be absolved from the necessity of taking the precautions which every magistrate was bound to take? But in cases of treason itself, justices of peace, in ordering commitments, were bound by act of parliament to proceed in the same way as in the case of inferior crimes. A justice of peace could only commit for treason as felony and breach of the peace, and proceed in the same manner as in cases of felony, or breach of the peace. Now none of these forms had been observed with respect to any of the persons whose petitions lay on the table. With respect to the individual whose petition he had first presented, Francis Ward, the proceedings against him had originated not with the secretary of state, but with the magistrates of Nottingham. The officers began searching his house without showing any warrant or authority whatever. The proceedings in that case appeared indeed to have been irregular from the very beginning. Next, with respect to the treatment of those persons in prison, he knew he should be told that on this subject there was great exaggeration  and it might be so. He himself had happened to see the directions sent down by the secretary of state to one of the prisons where several of these persons were confined. It was a particular order that irons should not be used unless necessary. But though the secretary of state gave such directions, he took care that the magistrates should not be allowed to see whether these orders were attended to or  465 not whether or not the persons were subject to ill treatment and therefore, notwithstanding the order, he would say, that the secretary of state was responsible for every instance of ill treatment contrary to It is own directions. But supposing even that their ill treatment was exaggerated  supposing even that the evils which they endured might be described too emphatically it was by no means wonderful, that men taken as the petitioners were from their families, and detained so long in confinement, should be very impatient under their imprisonment; and express that impatience in terms of strong resentment. But there was one part of their treatment which was not exaggerated their solitary confinement  a thing unknown to our old law and in the opinion of many persons so grievous a punishment, that it was not inferior to death itself. He begged leave to read an entry from the Journals, to show the idea which was formerly entertained of solitary confinement. It was in 1689, and it referred to the case of lord Castlemaine, who was confined in the Tower under a warrant of the secretary of state, on a charge of high treason. In a petition to the House, of which he was a member, he desired that he might have the liberty of the Tower, and that he might not be kept in close confinement; and the House being informed that he was not allowed to see his friends or servants, an order was made that they should be admitted to him, that a bill should be brought in to regulate the imprisonment of the subject,* and that Mr. Attorney General should prosecute the keeper of Newgate; such were the resolutions of the Commons at that time; and he hoped that the House would follow the example, and appoint a committee to examine into the truth of the matters alleged in these petitions, and take measures for giving redress. But he contended also, that the manner in which the petitioners was discharged was as contrary to the practice of the law, as the manner in which they had been committed to prison. He would ask the attorney-general how persons could get out of gaol who were committed to be delivered in due course of law, without pardon or acquittal? They could only come out by due course of law, except * See New Parliamentary History, Vol. 5, p. 406. 466 by pardon. Letting them out on their own recognizances, was only letting them out on an inferior sort of bail. Now, he would contend, that the manner in which the petitioners were allowed to come out was as illegal on the part of the officers of the Crown, as it was unjust towards the petitioners themselves. It was illegal because it was contrary to all the statutes from Edward the first; and unjust, because it left the parties with a stigma on their characters, which, if they had been tried, would most probably not have attached to them. The first statute on this subject was that of the 3rd of Edward 1st, commonly called the statute of Westminster. This act went to replevins, the only sort of bail known at that time; and from this it was argued in favour of the power of a secretary of state to commit, that the power which the king formerly possessed had been transferred to the secretary of state. A magistrate could not bail in a case where he could not commit. By a subsequent statute of Philip and Mary, it was enacted, that all the offences were not bailable which had been enumerated in the statute of Westminster; and that a magistrate could not discharge a prisoner upon his recognizance, if committed on a charge of high treason. So that if it was true that these persons were committed for high treason, they could not be let out on bail, much less on their recognizances.  and their discharge was contrary to law. If it was said, that had this been illegal, the court of King's-bench would have objected to the proceeding  he could only answer, that the court had only then to consider of the recognizances, so that the question of the legality of their discharge was non coram judice; and as to any argument deduced from the voluntary appearance of the prisoners in the court to have their recognizances discharged, and the acknowledgment of the legality of the preceding thereby implied, the answer was, that no subsequent act of the prisoners could have any retrospective effect, so as to render legal what was net previously decided to be according to law. But even admitting that magistrates had the power of bailing for high treason, they did not possess that power as lately exercised; for in the case of the prisoners, one magistrate had taken their recognizances in some instances, whereas by the act of Philip and Mary, in all bailable offences it was necessary that the bail should be  467 given before two justices, and one of those the justice who had taken the examination. The mode, therefore, in which these persons were discharged was contrary to law, as well as their discharge itself. It was obvious, that if this system was pot stopped, the secretary of state would possess a dreadful power of punishing without trial. An hon. and learned friend of his had lately expatiated, with great truth, on the evils arising from the delay of justice in the Northern counties. Suppose that in one of those Northern counties which had been alluded to Westmoreland for instance  a man were committed by the secretary of state a week after the assizes; there he might lie for eleven months, and upon the near approach of the next assizes might be bailed by a magistrate, who had no right to do so, and discharged, without having any remedy for his long imprisonment. Such a case might arise at any future period in the four Northern counties, if the principle lately acted upon were admitted to be law. It was true he might bring his action for false imprisonment; but if no more information were given him of the charge against him than had been given the men who had been confined under the late suspension act; that is, if he was not allowed to know the facts with which, or the persons by whom, he was charged two or three witnesses might be brought forward who would swear to particular facts, and he would have the costs to pay. It might appear strange, that he who was so decidedly against the state imprisonments who thought the arrest and treatment of the persons who had suffered by them were uncalled for and oppressive  should yet complain of their discharge; but on a little consideration it would be allowed that he was perfectly consistent. He complained of the manner in which these men were discharged, because it took from them all remedy because it deprived them of all means of clearing their character, and obtaining compensation for the losses they had suffered, and the hardships to which they had been subjected. But this was not his only motive, nor was it the only duty of the House to see these men righted. It was the duty of the House to take notice of the violation of the laws, and to punish those who were their violators, though the petitioners had had no connexion with the transactions in question, and had no com- 468 plaints to make against the government. In alluding to what was said in a former debate, that no person of consequence was imprisoned under the suspension act, that no gentleman was arrested who could make his complaints be heard through the medium of his speeches, that no victim was made whose fate and sufferings could excite the attention or call forth the indignation of the country, he declared his belief that such a position was true; and that his majesty's ministers were well aware of the security they derived from the low rank of their prisoners. They seized upon them because they wanted victims of some kind to justify their measures, and it was not safe to lay hold of others who would not have submitted so quietly to their fate, or have accepted of their discharge on such conditions, who could neither have been imprisoned nor turned out of prison without creating some noise. Not only was the rank of these victims such as to preclude them from making their complaints be heard with effect, but the House was told that their complaints ought not to be listened to, because their allegations were false.  It had been argued, that they could not be believed, and that therefore their petitions for inquiry laid no sufficient ground for the present motion. Even admitting the premises of the gentlemen opposite, he could not see the justness of their conclusion. If the allegations of the petitioners were as false as they were contended to be, he still thought his motion ought to be entertained, in order to have them disproved, and to show to the country that ministers, in the exercise of the extraordinary powers entrusted to them, had not proceeded with unnecessary rigour or acted contrary to the authority of law. He had been told that Francis Ward, whose petition he had made the ground of his motion, was a bad character, and therefore unworthy of the attention of the House. But he would ask, on what ground the charge was advanced? Had he done any thing which had been proved against him? Had he been convicted of any offence? On the old maxim of law, which he was sorry to see discountenanced by some members of the House, every man ought to be presumed innocent till he was found to be guilty; and this person ought therefore to be considered as honest and credible till he was convicted of being the contrary. He would not only rely on this general doc-  469 trine, but he would say that he had the authority of government itself for declaring that this Ward was not a dangerous character, if the secretary of state might be judged by his acts. The Habeas Corpus act was suspended in March, and the object of it (an improper object, in his opinion), was declared to be to confine dangerous persons. Yet Ward was not apprehended till late in June, after the disturbance in Nottingham, and the outrages in the neighbourhood, which was represented as in rebellion. He had a right therefore to conclude, that Ward was not a person of a dangerous character, or he would have been previously apprehended (if the secretary of state had not suffered him to continue at large, that he might become one of his victims); and that having been apprehended he would have been brought to trial, instead of being discharged. But he did not think the question of the character of the man, as it applied to the present motion, a matter of any consequence. It might be more advantageous, if an impression on the feelings of the House were regarded, that the first petition which should be brought forward, should be from a man whose character stood clear; as, for instance, the man whose petition had that night been presented by his hon. and learned friend. As a matter of justice, it would be better perhaps, that if the cases themselves were equal, that if this man, whose character was not clear, should be first attended to by the House, because such a person was less likely to receive assistance and protection from others in obtaining justice. A testimonial had been sent to him with the petition of Ward, by persons who stated themselves to be his neighbours, but who were not known to him (lord F.) to the good character of Ward. He should not, however, take up the time of the House with any arguments on this subject, for he did not ground his motion on the character of the petitioners but on the breach of the law which had taken place in their persons, and he thought the House would see the absolute necessity of inquiring a little into the treatment of those who had been apprehended, imprisoned, and subsequently got rid of in the manner he had described, He hoped the House would agree with him, and he should move, ""That a Committee be appointed to examine into the truth of the allegations of the said Petitions, and report their opinions thereupon to the House."""	-25.0	1818.0	1810

Butterworth.  1561 difficulties of the undertaking more than I do. Any attempt which is to interfere with the habits, the manners, and daily subsistence of the most helpless and improvident of our fellow subjects, requires, no ordinary carefulness and caution. It has to embrace in one comprehensive system of provision and regulation the most numerous and least tractable, because the least informed, classes of society. It must labour to reconcile and provide for the diversified, and in many respects conflicting, interests of districts, not less separated from each other by difference of manners than by distance: not more distinguishable by their sources of industry, than by their local peculiarities. It must struggle to unite such measures as are indispensable for the general safety with those which are urged by humanity, for the protection of the forlorn and the destitute. Sir, when I reflect upon these and many other difficulties which surround the task I have taken upon myself, I must acknowledge that I almost repent me of my own temerity. That feeling presses more deeply on my mind, when I consider the many great and distinguished persons who have taken up the subject with much original ardour, and have finally relinquished it; often without attempting any thing, and rarely having effected much for the cure of mischiefs, which it is much more easy to discover, than to devise any safe and practicable remedy to remove. But, however painful, laborious, difficult, or ungracious the task may be, the time is come when the House must resolve to encounter this most important subject, and grapple with all its intricacies and perplexities. That the poor-laws, as they are now administered, operate injuriously and oppressively to the best and most immediate interests of the country, none will deny, with whom it would not be a waste of time to dispute. The petitions on your table, and what I may call the universal cry of the public, proclaim the mischief and demand a remedy. If doubts lurk in any rational mind upon this point, a reference to the useful labours and painful researches of the different committees of this House upon the subject of the poor-laws, and the various returns made under the orders of this House, must dispel and remove them. With your leave, Sir, and that of the House, I will shortly refer to a few of those facts which bear more immediately upon the subject. It 1562 appears by the population returns laid upon your table this session, that the population of Great Britain and Ireland, exclusive of the islands in the British seas, amounted, in the year 1821, to 21,236,636; that of England and Scotland being 14,379,677, that of Ireland no less than 6,846,942; that the increase of population in England, between that time and the census taken in 1811, is 18 per cent, that the surplus upon the census of 1801, is 321/2 per cent; and that the mesne increase of England, Wales and Scotland, between 1801 and 1821, a period of no more than 20 years, has been no less than 31 2/3 per cent. The late returns of Irish population refer to the census of 1813, as the first regular return on the subject, so that the increase cannot be so accurately estimated; but supplying the deficiencies in the last return by reasonable inference from the earlier documents, the population of that country appears to have augmented in rather a more accelerated ratio than that of either Scotland, Wales, or England. That some, and perhaps a considerable portion, of this great apparent increase arises from the inaccuracies of the former census, I believe to be the fact; but making every reasonable allowance and deduction upon this account, it is manifest that the general population of the United Kingdom has much augmented. It is to be observed, that this increase is by no means fluctuating or occasional. It is not to be referred to any local or temporary cause: our numbers have swelled in a steady and uniformly accelerating ratio in every county and city that has made returns, and that without such an influence from the poor rates as some of our most ingenious theorists have not irrationally conjectured to be necessary for producing it. I draw this inference from the facts, that the population of Scotland, where the relief afforded the poor is very limited, has augmented in a ratio of only two and a seventh per cent less than England, where the numbers have so enormously multiplied; while that of Ireland, where the poor-laws are altogether unknown, exceeds that of either in its proportionate increase. If the demand for labour has increased in the same proportion with the increase of population in England and Wales, it is the most decisive proof of our accumulating prosperity and power. If, on the other hand, the number of hands exceeds the natural demand for labour, the surplus  1563 labourers with their families are reduced to idle consumers, and become a heavy drain upon the capital of this country through the means of her poor-rates. Neither, when we are considering the balance between the quantum of labour, and the demand for it with reference to the poor-rates, should the increase of labourers in Scotland and Ireland be struck from the account. The unemployed surplus, and often more than that surplus, will naturally migrate from these poorer countries, where there is no protection against want by poor-rates, into England, where the prices of labour, and particularly of the coarser kinds are higher than home. If a superabundance of labour exists here, such an influx must increase it. If the number of competitors exceeds the natural demand for their labour, and thereby depresses its price beyond the true value, that depression compels the English labourer to have recourse to the poor-rates, and thus the emigrant Irish or Scotsman indirectly augments those funds, from which, as the law now stands, he can derive no support. Sir, I have hazarded these remarks because the rise in our rates is attributed by some to this increased population. The observations are not to be overlooked in considering this subject. But whether correctly applicable or otherwise, we may turn from them to the more directly conclusive facts, that the poor-rates between 1750 and 1821 have increased in the proportion of above ten to one. That the number of persons receiving relief in the year 1818, either as permanent or occasional paupers, as calculated upon the census of 1811, was no less than 93/4 in every hundred, or nearly one in every ten of the entire population; and that the aggregate amount of our annual poor-rates in 1821, as well as those of the immediately preceding years, were almost one-seventh of the total annual income arising from the landed revenue, calculated upon the return made in 1815: a return which is much higher than any that could now be made under the existing circumstances of agricultural depression and distress*. * The average amount of the money raised and expended for the use of the poor in 1750, was 689,971l.; in 1816-17, 6,918,217l.; in 1817-18, 7,890,148l.; being an increase beyond the preceding year of 971,931l. This was the highest 1564 It is impossible to, look upon a mischief spreading thus widely, uniformly, and irresistibly, without a degree of terror bordering on dismay. Its result, if not counteracted speedily and manfully, must reduce the entire country to the condition in which four Sussex parishes + have represented themselves in their recent return to be, a condition to which I fear some other parishes seem fast approaching. For if the poor-rate swallow up the entire profits of the lands, they will be rendered not, worth cultivation, as yielding neither gain to the landlord, nor advantage to his tenant. A crisis the more to be apprehended, because every diminution of the occupier's profit reduces his ability to employ the labouring poor, and thus creates an additional necessity for an increased rate upon whatever little remains. That some remedy must be applied to averting the impending calamity seems uni- annual amount of the poor-rates yet known. Since then they have gradually declined as follows: But the average increase of the poor-rates calculating upon each three years from March 1812, to March 1821, is The entire of these reports, by the committees on this subject, are worthy of the general attention. It is to be hoped that they will be continued annually, and upon enlarged principles of inquiry. + See the return of the poor-rates and population in these parishes. Northiam, near half the population paupers, rates at 1l. 11s. 6d. in the pound. Salehurst, half the population paupers, rates 16s. 9d. in the pound. Dewash, more than half the population paupers, rates 11s. 2d. in the pound. May-field, half population paupers, rates 14s. in the pound. Not having the means of inquiry, I can only suspect that some, and possibly a considerable part of these enormous rates arises from the mischievous practice, of paying some portion of the labourer's wages with part of the rates.  1565 versally agreed. Some persons, and they are not a few, seeing nothing in the system but its mischief, and disgusted with its practical and pressing evils, propose to eradicate altogether that code laws, which has, for between two and three centuries, regulated the support of the poor, and to sweep away, either immediately or at no very remote period, the laws of parochial, removal, settlements, and poor-rates. Sir, I must avow that I want courage to adopt such a bold, violent, and precipitous measure; to me it would afford the most strong and serious grounds for alarm. It is seldom wise or statesmanlike to root out at once laws, however originally misconceived, which have become identified with the habits and manners of the country. A system under which nearly two millions of the people of England have been lodged and clothed and fed, must not at one single pull be so unceremoniously overturned. Little less than eight millions of money are divided annually, among the people, their wives, and their children, from the poor-rates. To pluck such large means of subsistence, as it were, from the very mouths of the poor without affording them ample time for supplying it from other resources, would be cruel, if it were safe; and would be most unwise, as it would be most dangerous I say most dangerous, as it must arouse the strongest feelings of nature against our civil tranquillity, and give to popular commotion the colour of necessary resistance against wanton oppression. These reasons would deter me from such schemes and efforts, if I were satisfied that these laws had been mischievous in their original institution, and repugnant to the sound principles of civil economy. But, upon the best consideration I can give the question, and I do not speak without having reflected much upon it, I must say, that the poor-laws, when administered in their original spirit, appeal to me more likely to produce benefit than disadvantage to the people. There is little doubt, that the artificers, peasants and all the lower classes of this country have increased more rapidly in mechanical skill, in useful knowledge, and also in the comforts and decencies of social life, that those of any other country in civilized Europe. The peasantry of all European nations may be considered as having made their start together towards civil improvement and importance somewhat more early than the reign of our Elizabeth. If 1566 there existed, any perceptible distinction in their respective conditions in different states, those of England could not boast, the advantage of any relative pre-eminence. Yet, in this race of civil refinement, they have ultimately outstripped all their rivals. The connexion of this effect with the existence of the poor-laws appears more striking by comparing the condition of humble life in England with that which, obtains in Scotland and in Ireland. They all live under the same constitutional law receive the, influence of the same governing system enjoy the same freedom, and may, boast, that the upper ranks of life in all assimilate as much as possible to each other in knowledge, manners, ants, and civilization. Yet the general condition of the English labourer excels that of the Scotch, where these laws, are adopted under a very limited modification, and far outstrips that of the Irish, where they are wholly unknown. Sir, I am far fro wishing to push this conclusion beyond its fair limits. Much less do I entertain the idle conjecture, that the present distressed and degraded state of Ireland is altogether, owing to the want of poor laws. To that most melancholy effect many complicated, causes, which may be traced to a remote date, undoubtedly co-operate. But there are some calamities which have recently fallen on that fine country which a moderate, poor-rate might have averted. In 1816 the potatoe crop failed, and the people must have starved if the government had not stepped forward to succour them. In the present year, the same misfortune occurred, and the failure of one single kind of food would have brought down, famine and pestilence on the people, in the midst of abundance of every other article of consumption, if they had not been averted (if they are averted), by the noble and generous efforts of the people of this country, aided by no inconsiderable exertions of their own gentry, and by a prudent and cautious assistance from, his majesty's government. If some provision must be made against such occasional visitations, I prefer that of a moderate, parochial rate, to one which, is to be furnished by the king's government. If any thing like general recourse should be had to that indiscriminating mode of showering down relief, I know of no prudence that could place either fine or period to its progress: there would be neither means of control, nor motives for economy.  1567 The re-action which takes place in this country, and causes a demand for labour from an effort to avoid the increase of poor-rates, could not exist, and there would be no end to application until the fund that was to supply, the cravings of the people was totally consumed. I do not offer these remarks as wishing to introduce this system into Ireland in the present state of society, but to demonstrate the policy and expediency of continuing it in this country where it has so long existed*. Founded upon these reasons, and others with which it would be inconvenient to exhaust the House's patience, my design is, not to destroy the existing system for relieving the poor, but to restore and bring it back, so far as the existing grades and habits of society will admit, to the true spirit of the statute passed in the 43rd year of the reign of queen Elizabeth. Previous to pointing out the means by which I propose to effect this object, it may not be improper to draw the attention of the House to the more prominent and * The foundation of the system for occasionally sustaining the laborious classes by poor-rates seems referable to the following principles. The price of labour must always constitute the chief source of the labourer's support. As far as that price depends upon actual value, it must be regulated by the demand, and what the employer can afford to give, looking to a beneficial return for it. But, the labourer must also take into consideration how far the price of labour is sufficient to purchase subsistence for himself and his family. These from necessary causes, must ultimately find their level, and balance each other. But occasional fluctuations from accidental causes, such as a fall in foreign markets, failure of crops, &c. must occasionally occur. The price of labour will always fall immediately with the decline of the employer's profit; but although it must ultimately rise with it, the rise is not equally prompt. For times of occasional dearth and disability, the labourer ought in strictness to provide, by saving from his surplus earnings in more abundant seasons; but, unfortunately, the labourer is seldom a saver, and is no good husbander of superabundant means. It is against these occasional periods and fits of distress that the poor fund seems intended to provide, and constitutes a useful provision. 1568 general causes to which the progressive increase of these rates is attributed; to explain the law as it originally stood under the act of Elizabeth; and specify the leading efforts which have been made by the legislature to amend or alter it. Upon this last subject, the House will not fail to remark, that our ancestors, faithful to the genius and spirit of our legislation in this as in every other instance, have uniformly endeavoured rather to amend and improve, than to repeal and destroy, the original enactments. Of most of these causes of our increasing rates, it is merely my purpose to bring them before the House for its consideration, rather than to comment upon their operation and. extent. Some of them are of a nature altogether occasional: such are those which originated in the want of employment of the manufacturing classes at the termination of the war, and which are now fortunately at an end; and that arising from the melancholy extent of our agricultural distress, which still continues to exhaust and oppress the country. With these is to be classed an evil deeply felt in some districts, as the resulting consequence from both the former; I mean the great number of removals of persons who became chargeable to a certain extent, from their inability to procure a sufficiency of work or wages to maintain them and their families, and who were on that account removed back to their places of settlement, where they could procure neither. For occasional demands upon the charity and capital of the country, from causes like these, against which the poor have not means nor foresight to provide, there does not seem any reasonable prospect of devising an efficient remedy. With them may be ranked one more permanent, but likewise local and peculiar, I mean that over breeding, if I may so speak, for particular callings and trades, which is the usual consequence of a relative excess of wages in different manufactures, and of that natural predilection which parents feel to educate their children to the business in which they have themselves been trained up. Unless the demand for the manufactured article increases with the increase of manufacturers, all must abate in wages, and some be kept out of employment. The evil is nourished by the inherent ambition of all ranks in the advanced stages of social refinement to push themselves upwards; and it unfortunately happens, that those bitter lessons of inconvenience  1569 which ultimately work the cure of each individual excess, operate too slowly and remotely to prevent its recurrence in other casts of employment and pursuits of life. To a certain extent, therefore, we must always calculate that this cause of distress will be locally and partially felt. A more extensive, and infinitely more alarming one, if it really exists, is that to which I have already called the House's attention; namely, a general excess in the quantity of labour beyond the demand for it, owing to an excessive increase of our population. If this evil does gain ground upon us, it is beyond the reach of redress from any alteration in our system of maintaining the poor; neither the spade husbandry, nor parish farms, nor any other palliatives, of ancient or modern device, will do. The only effectual remedy will be found in the encouragement of some system of colonization, a subject to which I shall hereafter refer. But, Sir, it appears to me, that the true cause of our malady lies chiefly in the mal-administration of the poor-laws; which, from being originally wise and useful, have been recently perverted into an instrument the most pernicious and destructive to the independence of the lower classes of society, and thereby to the general prosperity of the country. That some causes must operate beyond the increasing wants of the poor and impotent to produce the increase of rates, seems demonstrable from the fact, that in their rise and fall they keep no corresponding pace with the existence or decline of those causes, with which the wants of the labouring classes are most obviously connected. They have augmented progressively since the year 1750, during the most flourishing periods of the empire, and with the general growth of our wealth, our commerce, and our manufactures. The price of corn and other provisions has affected this increase but little. The fluctuations in the demand for labour have produced occasional, but scarcely perceptible changes in the comparative scale. In all counties and in all districts, in England and in Wales, in the north and in the south; in all cities, towns and places, whether the population be agricultural, manufacturing, or commercial, the rates augment, and the demands of the poor accumulate. Although the nominal price of food and raiment has fallen by our return to a metallic currency although the real value of every article of the first 1570 necessity has diminished by their abundance and plenteous increase notwithstanding the restoration of employment to our manufacturers, the reanimation of our commerce, and the recent aid of a new and more prudent mode of administering the parish funds, the rates have not declined so much in the last three years as they increased in the single year from March, 1817, to March, 1818 a more striking and conclusive evidence that the evil originates from mismanagement, arises from the observation, that it has yielded to the activity, energy, and vigilance of public spirited parishioners, in those places where they have superintended the administration of the fund with a sober, temperate, and steady regard to economy. Some instances of the effect of this attention are to be found in the evidence reported by your committees; some have occurred within my own personal observation; and many more have been stated to me upon the most credible report. Having thus detailed some of the causes of our present condition, I proceed to give a short account of the law, as it is to be traced in the statute books. The 43rd of Elizabeth projected the means of support for the impotent poor, and of educating the young; but it neither provided for, nor conceived, a general state of the labouring poor such as now exits. The churchwardens and three or four substantial householders annually appointed, were fully adequate to that species of parochial duty, assigned to them by the act. But those who made it, never contemplated that persons selected solely for their substance should become the daily task masters of the parish, and supply work and materials to all who, from laziness or indolence, or any other cause, were unable to procure the one or the other. In directing that the poor should be set at work, the act intended rather a measure of salutary police, than one of local general employment as a means of subsistence. But, in whatever light that act is to be viewed, it is clear that its present uses have far outgrown the machinery devised or effecting its original purposes. Persons usually selected for overseers can neither spare time nor forethought from the urgent calls of their own affairs to superintend the domestic economy and supply the various wants, or check the unreasonable claims, of a large and active, and, in many instances, a cunning and vicious population. Hence their expen-  1571 ditures have necessarily been lavish and inconsiderate; their method of levying and collecting, the parish funds careless, irregular, and slovenly; and their manner of keeping their accounts, inaccurate and confused. A loss from neglecting their private affairs being individually felt, is carefully avoided; but the consequences of mismanaging the parish concerns are overlooked in the feeling that an injury is trifling which is shared, among many. Thus negligence and inattention do much mischief, but ignorance and inexperience produce more: almost before the overseer has acquired some insight into the duties of his office his year terminates, and he yields his place to a successor as raw and ignorant as he himself had been when originally appointed. Neither, Sir, are the lavish and improvident squanderings of the parish property to be exclusively attributed to this local deficiency in its management. I regret to say, that the notions and principles commonly taken up and followed by magistrates, in making orders of relief, operate a much more wide and permanent mischief. The power of ordering relief vested in a single magistrate, residing near the dwelling of the poor man who requires it, is attended with much utility. It seems in theory to be impregnable to reasonable objection; yet in practice it has been attended with no small disadvantage. Its greatest and cardinal inconvenience is, that a single justice is unable to bear up against the clamour of his neighbours, and unwilling to hazard their good opinion by a steady rejection of a specious, but unwarranted application. One or two justices yield to the hardship of the individual case, instead of adhering to some universal, inflexible, steady principle, in administering the law of relief. They do not reflect, that it would be much more wise, and even more humane as a general rule of conduct, to make the particular case bend to the general law, than to force the general law to bend to the individual case. Where indigence is entitled to extraordinary commiseration from peculiar hardship in its circumstances the sufferers may and ought to call for the gratifying exercise of private benevolence. But such instances furnish no sound apology for departing from those general rules which ought to govern the distribution of a common fund. It is in truth, at best, but an indulgence of private feelings at 1572 the public expense. The natural and necessary consequence of this practice has been, that the special circumstances which warped the judgment in making the original order are speedily forgotten, while the extent and nature of the relief is noted and remembered; and thus, that which in its origin constituted a humane exception, becomes registered as a governing rule, from which it is deemed unwise and scarcely safe to depart. These principles have caused much inconsiderate and injudicious interference with work-house relief and discipline, and, indeed, every species of parochial management. It was held to be the duty of parish officers to search out work for the pauper, who was thereby discharged from the obvious duty of procuring it for himself. Unless they were so fortunate as to obtain what he might be too lazy to seek for, he was to be adjudged entitled not merely to a sufficiency to sustain himself and his family, but to be placed in an equal, if not in a better situation, than the meritorious, considerate, and, I may add, high-minded labourer, who maintains himself and his family by the produce of his hard and honest labour. It was farther held by many, under an erroneous interpretation of the law, that this work must be found within the boundary of the individual's settlement. Although work could be obtained nearer to the poor man's dwelling, yet, if in another parish, it was thought from some reference to the statutes of Charles 2nd, that he could not be compelled to go to it, and must be supported, and amply supported, by his own. The inevitable effect of such indiscriminate and wild prodigality of relief has been; as it must be from the nature of man, and woman also; to remove and put away from the minds of the lower classes, those feelings and habits of sober, prudent, domestic economy and frugality, which peculiarly and honourably distinguished the wise and provident manners of their ancestors. That foresight with which heaven has blessed mankind to provide against the accidents of life, and the accustomed recurrence of distressful times and seasons, is dismissed as a useless and teasing quality by the pauper, to whom it is indifferent, whether he comes to the justice or the overseer, fuming from the ale-house, or fresh from a country excursion, or reeking in the effects of the most laborious toil, if, like a parish annuitant, he is entitled to  1573 demand and receive equal relief, without distinction or inquiry, whether his wants are owing to his vices or his misfortunes. Sir, I appeal to the experience of all who hear me, whether this picture of putting the hand into our neighbours' pockets to relieve others, is overcharged in truth or colouring. That the public, and, as I trust, the great body of the magistracy, if not now, will soon be alive to the impolicy and illegality of this mode of administering relief, I hope and believe. Many have doubted, and not without grave authority to support their opinion, whether the distressed and impotent poor are entitled to any assistance from the public as a matter of common right. Lord Holt is reported to have said, when speaking of casual poor, that unless relieved by private charity, they must starve. Sir, to me this notion appears erroneous. The necessitous poor are entitled to some relief; but it is of the most stinted and penurious kind. According to the language of Horne's Mirror of Justices, which is the oldest authority, it is limited to such relief, as may prevent their dying from want of sustenance. Or, to use the language of an act of Henry 8th, to such as may prevent them begging from very necessity. But neither these laws, nor that of Elizabeth, nor any interpretation put upon them by our ancestors, ever considered or supposed, that the poor man, without work, was to live with his family a co-rival in comfort and respectability with the honest provident labourer who derived his support from his personal industry. I am happy to acknowledge, that the giving of relief through those improvident mistakes and errors to which I refer, originated from the most benevolent and excellent feelings and motives. But I have to do with their consequences, not with the motives from which they arise. The vice and danger of the age, and particularly of this country at this moment, is, that the most hazardous and unwise projects and practices are obtruded upon the public mind, graced with virtuous intentions, and recommended by honest but mistaken motives. Sir, the result has been an increase of the poor to an unnatural, unwholesome, and ruinous extent. Scarcely less than one in every ten of our entire population are either permanent or occasional paupers. A poll-tax little short of 17s. per head is levied to sustain them. The sum wanted for the really necessitous poor, 1574 except in periods of national calamity, must always bear nearly the same ration to our population. Any fluctuation from temporary causes ought, as it depends upon them, to be commensurate with them. A decrease in the demand for labour, or a rise in the price of provisions should naturally produce a corresponding advance in the rates; and, on the other hand, a sudden and unusual demand for labour, and the cheapness of provisions, ought to cause a proportionate reduction. But the rise and fall in the rates seem never to have been materially affected by either class of causes. Since the year 1750 the price of labour, as well as of provisions, had undergone material variations both as to increase and diminution. But the poor-rates have been constantly progressing in an increasing ratio. The prices of labour, and of different kinds of labour, have differed much in different districts, and that without producing a corresponding alteration in the prices of food or clothing. Yet it appears by the returns on your table, that the applications for relief are nearly as numerous and as profuse, and certainly not less proportionably increasing in all. The manufacturer in a productive trade, whose wages are high, comes as boldly for relief, and receives it almost as readily, and not less abundantly, than the labourer whose wages in this period of agricultural distress are much too low. Sir, although these evils and mischiefs have arrived to a crisis at this time, it is not to be denied, that they were felt and complained of, at much more early periods; even as far back, if not farther back, than the reign of Charles 2nd. I shall shortly detain the House by a brief reference to those measures enacted by our predecessors to avert those evils of which they partially felt the effect, without anticipating their full extent. The first general measure was passed in the reign of Charles 2nd. Its provisions were much extended in that of William 3rd, and enabled the poor to seek employment in other places than those of their settlement, by the means and under the protection of certificates of settlement. One object of the certificate was, to guard against the dangers of vagrancy, of which our ancestors felt a wise and politic dread. Another, and more immediate one, was, to allow the bearer to migrate with his family into another district, and to prevent his removal from thence, by an en-  1575 gagement, that the parish receiving him should be protected from any burthenous consequence incident to his residence there. The measure may be presumed to have had practically some, beneficial effect, as it was the object of legislative care, down to the 12th of Anne, c. 18. But the consequences of entailing families, as it were by record, upon parishes granting certificates, made parish officers reluctant to give them; and the provision of 35 Geo. 3rd c. 101, by preventing removal until the party becomes actually chargeable, rendered them unnecessary. The result of which is, that certificates have grown almost, if not entirely, out of use. The next general measure was introduced by 9 Geo. 1. c. 7, which provided for the maintenance of the poor in work-houses, and imposed a wise restraint on the grant of relief by magistrates. Under that act no justice could order relief until application had been previously made either to the parishioners in vestry, or to two overseers. The provisions respecting work-houses still continue in force, and have undergone some subsequent statutory regulations. As it is not my purpose to intermeddle with them, I shall merely observe, that the mode of managing the poor by these means was materially affected by the discretionary power subsequently given to justices to order relief to the poor at their own homes without a right of appeal. The next alteration was introduced by the 22nd Geo. 3rd c. 83, usually known by the name of Mr. Gilbert's act. It enabled parishes and other places to unite and incorporate for the purpose of jointly maintaining their poor. By this plan the relief and management of the poor was vested in a more compact and permanent body than the parish overseers created by the 43rd Elizabeth. It took away also, to a great extent, the right of interference and control which justices possessed by former laws over the relief and management of the poor. Of its practical effects with reference to any comparative diminution of expenditure, no documents are furnished which enable me to form any thing like a correct opinion. It may be rationally conjectured, that neither that act, nor any of the various local ones, have kept down the rates to the extent calculated by their respective projectors. For those provisions by which they were limited to a definite amount have all, 1576 some how or other, been got rid of. Of their comparative effects upon the manners, morals, and population of the districts subject to such peculiar regulations, I have also no certain means of judging. But as with the House's leave it is not my purpose to intermeddle with these local systems farther than to extend to them certain powers for employing the poor in common with other parishes, I sheik hazard no farther observation, than that they appear to carry the imperfections of the work-house plan to a more mischievous, because to a much wider extent. Looking as I do upon the moral habits of the country to be the chief object of our guardianship and solicitude, I cannot view without much distrust and jealousy, institutions which bring together large bodies of people who have no common tie of union, except those of necessity and misfortune. The honest and the dissolute, the industrious and the idle, the young and the old, of either sex, are driven to shelter together in the same receptacle, with small means for their classification. Sir, I will not condemn such institutions, for I have no evidence to warrant me in so doing; but, sensible as I am that the example and contagion of vice are more prevalent than that of virtue, I can neither approve nor uphold them. The next important alteration was introduced by the 35th Geo. 3rd c. 101, which prevented the removal of the poor until actually chargeable. The consequences of this enactment might give rise to much discussion; but I will content myself with making one observation, which refers to all these acts. That observation is, that in all times, and under all circumstances, the legislature has never thought either of repealing the 43rd of Elizabeth or the acts respecting removals; but has laboured to fortify the principle, and improve the administration of these laws, without destroying either. I hasten now, Sir, to that valuable and important act passed in the 59th year of his late majesty. It was founded upon the patient, laborious, and indefatigable researches and inquiries of the committee, of which the right hon. member for Christ-church (Mr. S. Bourne) was chairman. Sir, if that gentleman had persevered in his, efforts on this subject, I should have preferred to have become the humble assistant of his labours, rather than to have brought forward an original measure of my own. That statute gives a  1577 power to parishes assembled in vestry to repose the general care and management of what concerns the poor in a limited number of their own body, to be called a select vestry. The obvious purpose of the provision was, to confide the trust in the most judicious and capable inhabitants, whose number should be too small to be liable to the confusion inseparable from crowded meetings, and yet sufficient to enable them to execute their duties alternately without personal inconvenience, and to press their proposals upon their fellow-parishioners with that efficient influence which is attached to numbers and to respectability of station. The act likewise gave to all places separately maintaining their own poor, the power of appointing one or more assistant overseers, with a salary. Under this provision, parishes were enabled to procure and pay (which they could not before do) a person competent to the duties of relieving and attending to the wants and condition of the poor, by a weekly, or, if necessary, by a daily superintendance. A less obvious, but not less important result, is, that it enables parishioners of a higher capacity and condition to undertake the office, when the more laborious part of the official functions may rest with their salaried assistant; while the general and more important duties of control and superintendance remain with themselves. These measures were well calculated to bring home, as far as it is necessary, the discipline and regulation of a work-house to the pauper's cottage, stripped of its moral dangers. They have been considered as being so wisely calculated to improve the old laws, that out of the total number of districts maintaining their poor, being 14,700, no fewer than 2,006 have already chosen select vestries, and 2,257 have appointed assistant overseers. But as the law now stands, the election of the assistant overseer, the amount of his salary, and the specification of his duties, rest with the parishioners at large. The danger of the selection of this most important officer under the influence of intrigue and cabal, the obvious propriety that those who are to superintend the parish concerns should become responsible for an efficient appointment, and that those should specify the duties, the discharge of which is to operate in relief of their own gratuitous labour, seem to require some alteration in these respects. I have therefore prepared a clause to vest 1578 these powers in the select vestry, instead of the parishioners at large. It must also happen that as a populous and extended district may require more than one assistant overseer, so the time of a person fitted for the office may be only partially occupied in a small parish, and his salary be too small to recompense him for devoting himself entirely to this arduous employment as a means of livelihood. I shall therefore propose, that the same person may be appointed by two or more neighbouring parishes to this office. Undoubtedly this may be effected under the existing law; but to guard against the possibility of abuse, I propose to limit the appointment to parishes within the distance of five miles from each other, and subject to the approbation of the petty sessions, by whom all such appointments must now be formally made. As the law now stands, select vestries are to superintend the collection and administration of the poor-rates. and the overseers are required to conform to their directions in these respects, as well as in what relates to the relief and management of the poor; but no power is given to the vestry, either to fix the amount of the assessments, or to prescribe the time at and for which such rates shall be made. This power is so obviously connected with their present duties of directing and controlling the expenditure, that I almost hazard the conjecture that the omission to give it has proceeded from mistake. I have framed a clause to supply what I regard as an obvious defect. The present law also gives to the select vestry a power to take into its consideration the character and conduct of the person applying for relief, and to distinguish in that relief between the deserving and the idle, the extravagant, and profligate poor. This provision is, in truth, the first effectual attempt to bring us back to the original scope and spirit of the 43rd of Elizabeth. It seems to me to be in substance rather a declaration of the law than a new enactment. But I am persuaded, that in what ever light it is to be viewed in this respect, the House will feel, that the regulation is not only salutary and expepedient, but absolutely essential; for some wise and temperate distinction between the sober and industrious but unfortunate poor, and those who are idle, lazy, and dissolute, must become the very corner stone of whatever reforma-  1579 tion we meditate. The operation of the statute is now confined to the person applying for relief. I propose to extend the inquiry and regulation to all persons constituting the same family. The head of a family is, during the minority of its subordinate members, morally responsible for its education and conduct. Their common means of support are applied, and regulated by him, even where it is not altogether provided by him. It is thus impossible to disconnect in practice the effect of relief which, though nominally given to one, is actually shared by all. It seems reasonable, therefore, that these inquiries should include the entire family. I have also thought, that it may be expedient to give the same power to parish officers in general, which is now confined by the act to select vestries and justices, when making orders of relief in those particular cases which are pointed out by the statute. If a select vestry is judiciously appointed, any foreign interference with their management of the poor will be generally mischievous, and always displeasing The 59th Geo. 3rd seems to have adopted this principle, when it made the concurrence of at least two magistrates necessary for an order of relief, made upon the ground, that what was offered by the select vestry was inadequate to the real wants of the pauper. It occurs to me, that the expediency of having all orders for relief made upon some fixed and certain rule, requires that this provision should be extended farther. I shall propose, therefore, to render the concurrence of no less than three justices necessary to such an order; and I will freely own, that I should have made that of a larger number essential, if the condition of the magistracy as to numbers in many, and more particularly in the northern and Welch counties would have admitted it. Thus far, Sir, the provisions of the intended bill are grounded upon those of 59 Geo. 3rd. The remaining clauses, although new in their provisions, proceed upon a principle acknowledged and admitted under every construction and interpretation of 43 Eliz. It is, that the indigent pauper is bound to repay by his labour what he receives in the sustenance of himself and his family; and that he who asks for relief must submit to work. It is my design, therefore, to propose that the same power which is given to guardians 1580 and visitors by 22 Geo. 3rd shall be extended to select vestries and to parish officers; namely, that of hiring out the poor to work while they do not procure it for themselves. I propose to extend the limit within which such employment may be obtained to any distance not exceeding ten miles from the pauper's dwelling. To carry this measure into effect, as well as those with which it is my intention to follow it up, for the purpose of urging the labour of the indigent poor into channels most likely to afford compensation to their parish, a thorough acquaintance with their state and condition, with the amount of their expenditure, and the resources for employing them, are indispensably necessary. To obtain this desirable object, I design to propose that the church-wardens and overseers of every parish shall prepare and make up two weekly lists of persons receiving parish relief: one, of the impotent poor, who are incapable of sustaining themselves by their labour; the other, of those able-bodied persons, who receive relief because the wages received for their labour are insufficient to support them and their families. Both lists are to contain the names, the ages, and the occupations of each pauper, and of their respective families, as well as the causes for relieving them. They are to be signed at the end of each week not only by one or more of the parish officers, but by the pauper, who is thereby to attest their correctness, in so far as respects his individual case. A summary of these lists is to be made up and returned quarterly to the justices at their petty sessions, at which not only the parish officers, but the surveyors of highways, and the contractors for public works, within a certain distance from each parish, are to be required to attend. Upon these highways and public works, all able-bodied persons receiving relief are to be compelled to work, at the discretion of the justices, after a full consideration of the utility of such employment, with reference to the public benefit as well as the particular interest of each parish. The wages of such labour, as also of that where paupers are hired out to private individuals, are to be paid as the parish officers shall desire; either to the pauper, or to the parish officers, to be by them applied in repayment of what may be expended for his support, and that of his wife and children, where they deem it expedient to withdraw that charge from the improvident individual,  1581 and take it upon themselves. From this employment, if judiciously applied to the most useful of public undertakings, that of making good roads, I am sanguine enough to anticipate much beneficial result; perhaps, ultimately to diminish the heavy burthens now levied on the country by the numerous turnpike trusts. Sir, I farther propose, that a general summary of these quarterly accounts shall be laid annually before the petty sessions, and that whenever the select vestry, the parish officers, or any number of inhabitants, rated in the aggregate to the amount of 50l. shall require it, those able-bodied males, who have received three month's relief in the preceding year, for themselves or their families; and all who have attained the age of eighteen, and were supported by parish relief for three years of their minority, either as part of their parent's family or otherwise, shall be selected and included in one list; that their names shall be arranged in numerical order by the justices, upon consideration of each individual's case; and that from this list persons shall be returned to serve in the militia for the parish, without ballot, according to the order in which they stand in the list. Of the right to call upon these persons to repay those who have fed and clothed them, by becoming militia substitutes for the parish, and thus relieving their benefactors from a heavy personal burthen, theta can be no doubt: of its expediency there will, I trust, be as little. It will ease the rated parishioner from the expense of providing substitutes which, though trifling in times of peace, is considerable in those of war. To serve in the constitutional force of the country is not degrading, and ought not to be distressing to any one, as we are all equally subject to these laws. But so far as it shall be thought a hardship, it may have a most salutary effect both fee the poor and the country. It will make those heads of families, who feel aversion to the service, either on their own account, or on that of their children, pause before they apply for parish relief. It may induce them and their employers also to pause before they give or take lower wages than the fair value of their service. It will then be no longer a question of indifference to the poor man, whether his wages are to be made up to him from the poor rates, or taken from his master's pocket. Sir, if it will have the effect of 1582 checking the practice of employing the poor as rounds-men, it will prove not less beneficial to the labouring poor than to the rated parishioner. But, as this list is not to be made up, except when the parish by its application shown it to be necessary, so no person is to be compelled to serve without every possible precaution that he shall not be improperly called upon. Cases of sickness are to be excepted. The list is to be annually revised by the magistrates. The names of persons are to be erased, who pay back a certain portion of what they have received from the parish; and their respective places in the list may be changed by the justices, so as to retard or accelerate their being returned to serve, upon proper application and due consideration of each party's conduct and character, and his exertions for the support of his family during the preceding year. If these lists are regularly kept, and I shall introduce such regulations and forms as appear to me best calculated to ensure their being so, a farther advantage will follow. They will lay the foundation for such accurate returns of the state and condition of the poor being regularly made to this House, as must enable it to probe the evil to the core, and by discovering where the disease lies, supply the legislature with means to devise more effectual remedies, if those which I now suggest should prove insufficient. The only remaining measure which I intend to propose for regulating the dependant poor, is one upon which I have thought much, and consulted many experienced persons. I do not wish to conceal from the House that I have felt much repugnance to bringing it forward, and that in doing so, I sacrifice my personal feelings to a sense of duty, and the conviction that it will prove beneficial. By 8 and 9 W. 3rd c. 30, all poor persons receiving parish relief were compelled to wear badges. The indiscriminate application of a distinction which, pointed out poverty as an object of shame and reproach, was considered to be a measure of severe, if not of cruel discipline. Hence it nearly fell into desuetude, as it were, by public consent, before it was actually, repealed, by 50 Geo. 3rd c. 52. But though this mark may be harsh and oppressive to many there are some to whom the application of it will be eminently useful, and the apprehension that it can be so applied may prove not less useful to many more.  1583 There exist in most parishes a set of spongers upon the parish funds, whom nothing can entice into any exertion for themselves or their families; persons to whom a workhouse has no terrors, who dissipate their means in debauchey, and submit their children to all the miseries and privations incident to idleness and vice; upon such persons the former provisions of this bill can operate nothing. It is proposed therefore, that justices, at petty sessions, shall be empowered to compel such persons and their families to wear badges for limited periods. But recourse is not to be had to this ultimate remedy, unless upon application by the vestry, or those officers to whom the care of the poor is entrusted, and after a scrupulous examination by the justices of the facts and circumstances under which it is asked for. Sir, the remaining provisions in the intended bill, respect the keeping and passing of parish accounts. It has been my fortune to have many such professionally laid before me; their confusion and inaccuracy are frequently so great as to defy every attempt at explanation; and although I will not say that they are made a cover for fraud and imposition, I must observe that a more secure and easy means for both could not be devised. There is no solid reason to prevent parish accounts from being kept us regularly and exactly as those of a private person; there are many and most cogent ones why they should, if possible, be kept even with more scrupulous stictness. Yet I will venture to say, that if any private gentleman had his accounts kept in the manner in which most parishes endure to have theirs kept and passed, his inevitable ruin must be the consequence, although his fortune should be ever so large. As a remedy for this enormous mischief, I propose that all parish officers shall keep a day-book and a ledger, in which they shall make their entries regularly; that at the end of every quarter they shall draw up a summary of the several heads of receipts and expenditure, with the sums due, both to and from the parish; these abstracts are to be submitted to the petty sessions quarterly, with all necessary vouchers, to be there audited and allowed. Sir, I shall endeavour to make this mode of keeping accounts as little difficult to parish officers as may be. For this purpose I shall add such forms for keeping them as appear, not only to myself, but to persons more conversant with 1584 such matters than I am, to be best calculated to unite simplicity of arrangement with necessary detail. Serious losses and inconvenience often occur from overseers retaining more of the rates in their hands than they ought. To guard against the hazard of such fraudulent practices, it seems necessary to give a power to justices, whore they think that any overseer has retained more parish money in his hands than is necessary, to direct him to pay it over to some of his fellow officers, with whom they may consider it may be more safely entrusted. The application of public money to the receivers' private purposes, under any circumstances, is an offence not to be tolerated: wherever therefore the overseer shall not forthwith obey this order, the amount held back shall be levied by distress upon his personal property. But as the remedy is prompt for the parish security, so the protection of the individual against mistakes should not be neglected. It is therefore proposed to give him an appeal against the allowance of the accounts in petty sessions, upon his finding adequate security for repayment of what shall be finally adjudged due from him by the quarter sessions, to which he makes his ultimate appeal. Such, sir, is the outline of those provisions which I intend to have the honour, with the House's leave, of submitting to it, in the shape of a bill. I am deeply sensible that every such measure re-requires the most minute and cautious consideration. I shall propose therefore, it the House grants me permission to bring it in, to move that it be read a first time and printed, without being carried farther during this session. The approaching recess will give time to the members, as well as to the country, to examine and scrutinize its various, and in some respects complicated, provisions. It is my ancious wish and desire that this should take place, as it is by such means alone that its adequacy for any useful public purpose can be truly judged of. If it should be found incompetent to its object, and incapable of amendment by the wisdom of this House, no man will rejoice more sincerely in its final rejection than myself. Sir, there is one other measure connected with my plan which is not included in the intended bill. It respects that supposed excess of population to which I have already alluded. Looking,  1585 as I do, upon the population of every kingdom as the main source of its power and prosperity, I cannot admit the existence of any superabundance of our people, beyond the demand for, their labour, without great reluctance, and much more evidence than is now before the House. A surplus in some parishes and districts may exist, without the country being generally crowded. If this inconvenience should be merely local, the laws now in force, coupled with the provisions of the intended bill, will, I trust, be found sufficient to remove it. The labouring classes may now remove where they please in search of employment. If the bread of idleness is not brought inconsiderately and lavishly home to their doors by their parish, they can seek work in places where the thinness of population admits of that demand for labour which will enable them to find it. If the entire county is so over-peopled as not to admit of this remedy, the only effectual redress will be found in a well-regulated system of colonization. This was the sole resource of the ancients against that national superabundance which, in Greece and Rome, was not unusual: not to speak of those hostile swarms which constantly poured from the northern hive, at least from the commencement of the Roman republic to the fall of the empire. Even in the present times, Ireland and Scotland have drawn occasional relief from the emigration of their people as well into this country as into America. Neither has the practice been confined to ourselves. It has not been uncommon on throughout Germany, Switzerland, and other parts of the continent. I know that theorists and others have sought their remedy against this malady in restraints and regulations, and discouragements of marriage among the poor; schemes infinitely more pernicious than any evil of which they complain. Sir, I will never either conceal or disguise my abhorrence of such fancies, which I think founded upon anti-social principles, utterly subversive of morality.* There is no legis- * The ancients classed marriage among the fundamentals of society and civilization.   Fuit sapientia quondam Publica privatis secernere, sacra profanis, Concubitu prohibere vago, dare jura maritis, Oppida moliri, leges incidere lingo: Sic honos et nomen divinis vatibus atque Carminibus venit. HORACE. 1586 lative instrument by which we can expel nature beyond its power of recurrence. We may defile and desecrate that institution which Heaven has consecrated we may remove the influence of moral restraint over the most powerful of human passions, but we cannot subdue it. Marriage in humble life is the parent of sobriety, of industry, of social affection, and of every domestic virtue which cheers and tranquillizes the poor man's cottage, both in the morn and in the decline of his frail existence. Never, no never, will I lend my assistance, with any view or for any purpose, however plausible, to tamper with an union, founded in the laws of nature, destined to yield happiness with innocence to youth, and to supply old age with the consolations of society and reciprocal support. Any system for colonization to be effectual, must obtain the assent and concurrence of his majesty's government. For this reason I have deferred to embody my notions on that subject in the shape of a bill during the present session. It ought properly to follow as a consequence upon the adoption of those reforms which I now propose to introduce. If such a plan is ever taken up, I would found it upon two essentially governing principles. First, that it be not made the instrument of fraudulent or involuntary eviction even of the poorest and most insignificant individual from his native country. Ample precaution should be taken, that all who avail themselves of the measure, should do so solely from the impulse of voluntary choice. The other would be, that those places which are pressed by the inconvenience should raise from their local funds the necessary means for enabling the poor to emigrate. This would form the most effectual guard against injudiciously pushing the practice beyond the evils which the measure is designed to remedy. No parish or place would incur the expense, unless compelled to it by an injurious superabundance of population; and no inhabitant would be aided to remove, unless when the inconvenience of over numbers was practically felt. That this measure may, at least for the present, be dispensed with in this part of the empire. I confidently hope and expect. Whether it may not be more immediately required in Ireland, as the only means of providing permanent succour for the poor, and insuring civil tranquil-  1587 lity to that country, is a question of a very different aspect. But whenever, or under whatsoever circumstances, we may be thus compelled to separate from our fellow subjects, we shall, I trust, sustain ourselves by the consolation, that they will carry with them British hearts, British principles, and British freedom; that they go to provinces won by the valour of their countrymen, or discovered by their nautical research, to become the means, I trust the auspicious means, of extending the language, the arts, the sciences of England, to remoter regions, and of transmitting them to future ages; laying in the firm foundations of their own immediate prosperity new and extended sources of increase for her commerce, her manufactures, and all her industrious monuments of civil and peaceful preeminence. Many subject connected with the regulation and support of the poor remain untouched by the provisions which I have thus detailed to the House. I shall, with your leave, Sir, shortly refer to the grounds upon which I have kept them distinct. The mode of imposing the poor's rate has occupied much of public discussion. It is wished, and not unnaturally wished, to cast some of that burthen, which is now almost exclusively sustained by the landed proprietor, upon the commercial and funded interests. Any local appropriation of a tax upon the funds among the 14,700 local establishments which now maintain their poor separately, would be unattainable in practice. We must either abandon the long and wise usage of sustaining the poor by small districts, or give up this attempt. To consolidate the poor-rates of the country into one national, or even into separate country funds, might obviate the objection; but such general establishments would give birth to others more numerous, and not less insurmountable. The very essence of this relief is founded on the peculiar circumstances of want or calamity, which give to each individual his temporary or permanent claim for assistance. The skill to apportion succour, with reference to the real wants of pauperism, to be efficient, must be local and personal; to be accurate, it must be minute and perpetual; to be vigilant, it must be quickened and animated by some direct and visible interest. All frugal care would be lost in the indiscriminating distribution of a national or a county fund. 1588 The struggle between parishes and paupers would rather be, to appropriate more than was their fair due of a common spoil, than to husband the produce of a general contribution. As these consequences demonstrate that such a plan would be either impracticable or ruinous, it is unnecessary to consider its effects and bearings upon another most important question; namely, the national faith; as it stands pledged to the public creditor. The rateability of commercial and other personal property is now fully established; but general experience has induced the country, as it were by common consent, to abstain from the exercise of a power with which every parish is clearly and completely invested. The answer to any attempt to render personal property, if possible, more liable to assessment is, that the law has already done all that it can do, consistent with the principles of sound and rational legislation. To the abominable means of an inquisitorial scrutiny from each individual of his actual ability, the law of England will, I trust, never resort. What national experience relinquishes as unattainable after long unsuccessful experiment, it is seldom, if ever, safe to revive. I had once thought that the effect might be indirectly obtained, by making all who are engaged in trade contribute a small sum per head for each person whom they employed; the amount to be applied in relief or other assistance of the individual on whose account it was contributed as occasion required. This would be in effect to form a kind of parochial compulsory saving-banks. But I was induced to relinquish this scheme, in the feeling that it must ultimately resolve itself into a tax upon labour; that it must in the end fall on the servant, although originally advanced by his employer; and thus compel the labourer at all times, and under all circumstances, to an equal contribution from his earnings, without reference to their amount, or his immediate capability. A farther important obstacle to the execution of such a plan is, that, to be effectual, it would require more complexity than seems convenient for any general national compulsory arrangement. Another subject of usual complaint is, the existing law of settlement. So far as that system causes an undue increase of the poor-rates, it must do so either as an injudicious or as an expensive mode of  1589 administering relief. Upon the propriety of continuing to relieve the settled poor by parishes or their subordinate districts, I have already laid my sentiments before the House. With respect to the trouble and expense of parish litigation, the topic is so popular, that it becomes scarcely prudent to hazard a doubt upon it; and yet, Sir, if the maintenance of the poor by small districts is desirable, the expense of law-suits and removals seems to some extent unavoidable. Variety of discordant interests must give rise to intricate and subtle questions of both fact and law; they may sometimes perplex the justices in sessions, and occupy their time, at no small expense to parishes; yet, after every possible reflection upon its consequences, and every allowance for the enormous expense, the law will be found, in this instance, as in all others, the only sure resource against fraud, injustice, and oppression. That the costs of removals and law-suits have been magnified beyond the reality, appears, Sir, by the reports on your table. They do not exceed in amount one twenty-fifth part of the total of what is raised for the exclusive use of the poor; an expense at which, I believe, few gentlemen can collect and manage their private incomes. I am bound to add, and I appeal to the experience of all who hear me to corroborate the assertion, that a fair and economical expenditure is generally secured by the employment of professional men, who rank, in point of integrity and respectability, with those of any profession whatever. Sir, these, I trust not ill-founded, apologies, are neither intended to conceal nor to do away with any fair ground of objection to particular heads of settlement law, as they may affect either the reciprocal interests of parishes, or the comfort and condition of the poor. One, the utility of which seems peculiarly questionable, is that of settlement by hiring and service, which not only gives rise to the most numerous and complicated questions of law and fact, but to a relative inequality of burthensome effect between different parishes; as it is evaded by the course of hiring in some counties, while it is scrupulously adopted in others. The settlement and binding out of apprentices more pre-eminently require our anxious consideration. The object of the statutes of apprenticeship was, to secure to the young and unprotected a useful and virtuous course of instruction, 1590 which might qualify them for the usual avocations of domestic life. Upon the indiscriminating haste with which they are now huddled in droves and flocks from the workhouse nursery to the manufactory, I shall trust myself with no other observation than that such practices are cruel and mischievous evasions of the wise and wholesome provisions of the law. In the turning a wheel, the opening of a valve, or the feeding of a spindle, the child meets with painful occupation, and is defrauded of its fair recompense in useful information. By such early employment the body is unfitted for the efforts of ruder labour, without either mind or body being trained up and adapted to the skill which is necessary for the usual sedentary employments of mechanical callings. Fortunate, most fortunate, will these early victims be, if they can count in their catalogue of ignorance and omission, that of remaining uninitiated in early vice and immature corruption! But, Sir, the evils are not confined to the consequences of such injudicious bindings: while the apprenticeship continues, the child shares at least some portion of a master's care, secured to him by the protection of humane and salutary statutes. But as the law of settlement now is, a male or female infant is settled by a residence for forty days under its indenture, though executed at the most childish age at which it may please the parish or their parents to bind them. Although the master or mistress should die, or become bankrupt, or disappear the very next after this fortieth day, the child is to remain estranged from the fostering care and moral protection of its parents during the continuance of its natural and necessary pupilage. Yet even here, where the mischiefs are so manifest, I am not without apprehensions that it will be found not altogether easy to devise remedies free from solid objection. The existing right of removing the poor to their place of settlement has been objected to, both in and out of this House, upon more serious grounds than that of expense: it has been declaimed against as harsh, impolitic, and cruel; as an oppressive encroachment upon the poor man's liberty; and as injurious to the industry and general interests of the country. Sir, our ancestors entertained very different notions upon this subject from those of their more bold and inno-  1591 vating progeny. As far as our institutions can be traced backwards, the great body of the people were restrained to continue in their settled dwellings under certain defined regulations. To this extent a law of settlement has existed, and been rigorously observed from the most remote periods of our law, as a measure of wise and necessary police. In the existing law I must profess my inability to discover any injurious or impolitic restraint; every person enjoys under it full liberty to remove where he pleases in search of work, and to continue there at his free will and pleasure, unless he becomes chargeable to the place thus selected for a new abode. That he shall not be tempted to wander, not suffered to continue without some reasonable prospect of obtaining work, is surely a wise and constitutional limit, not less useful for the poor man's comfort, than salutary for the public peace. By manful struggles against difficulties, both rich and poor are enabled to overcome them. Our changeable natures want no such temptations to lure us rather to fly from misfortunes than to wrestle with them. But I will leave it to any reasonable mind to calculate the innumerable evils which would result, in the present general facility of intercourse and conveyance, from not only suffering, but enticing every labouring man to run from his family, his connexions, and the responsibility of his personal character, under the legal assurance that wherever he chose to ramble he would be certain of sufficient support and a comfortable asylum. In this, as in many other instances, our reason is seduced from its more correct conclusions by some humane sympathy and compassion for particular cases. It is undoubtedly a great hardship that an industrious family should be removed from their accustomed dwelling and their usual course of employment, because they become accidentally chargeable through some occasional cause. But Providence, which looks primarily to the species, causes the antidote to arise from the very evil of which it allows; it renders the labourer and the artisan more cautious, more frugal, and more saving, that they may avert such a serious calamity from themselves and their children. Left to himself and to his own exertions, the poor man will do more for himself, and without injury to others, than any law can do for him. In the few cases in 1592 which he may prove unable to extricate himself, private liberality ought to assist; and it would cheerfully do so, unless it were kept back by the feeling that an application to the poor's rate renders such interference unnecessary and almost intrusive. Sir, upon these grounds it seems to me that the object of our law should be the direct reverse of what is here and in some other instances contended for; and that sound policy requires, that if any alteration is made, it should be rather to render removals even more easy, and the acquisition of settlements more difficult. Sir, the report of your committee goes strongly to support this opinion: ""It is uniformly found, that such inhabitants of a parish as have not acquired a settlement in it, and can obtain no such relief without being removed, are distinguished by their activity and industry, and generally possess, not only the necessaries, but the comforts of life; and your committee have lately heard with satisfaction, that the operation of the act of this session has already relieved some parishes of the metropolis from the heavy burthen of maintaining numbers of persons without settlements in England, who are stated now to support themselves, instead of applying for parochial relief, under the apprehension of being sent home.* It is farther most remarkable, that this principle has been uniformly followed without being openly avowed. For every proposed alteration in this branch of the law has terminated either in abolishing some modes of acquiring settlements, or in rendering other less easy to be gained; so that, whatever may have been suggested, and however recommended, no more easy and simple mode of settling the poor has hitherto been sanctioned by the legislature. One mitigation of the law of removals I have ventured to introduce, but which it escaped my recollection to notice in its proper place. Parishes often afford relief to their settled poor while residing elsewhere, upon principles of humanity, and obviously mutual advantage. My object is to render this practice legal to a limited extent, under certain guards and cautions; the principal one is, that such relief should only be given with the vestry's consent. * Report from the Committee on the Poor Laws, 1819.  1593 I trust this House will not think it unreasonable that those who are to bear the expense should possess the right of controlling it. Experience of what has followed from the attempts of others, has rendered me apprehensive of the unforeseen consequences of all untried measures upon this subject; I will therefore frankly avow, that I introduce even such an innovation upon the law with doubt and reluctance. But as the sense and feelings of the country have anticipated the measure, and given it the sanction of usage, which has not been followed by any perceptible inconvenience, I am encouraged to hope, that in the greater extent to which it may be carried by being rendered legal, it will prove harmless in its remoter consequences, and useful in its immediate effects. The only remaining branch of this law to which it seems necessary to refer, is that which respects illegitimate children: it is intimately and most seriously connected with the subject of parish expenditure; but for reasons with which it is unnecessary to fatigue the House at this time, it has hitherto been made the object of distinct legislative provisions. The present laws require much attentive consideration, both as they affect the morals and the general economy of the poor. I have thus briefly touched upon this subject, in the hope of calling some member's attention towards it who may have time and talents for the undertaking. I cannot conceal from myself that this plan, of which the House has now heard the detail with such kind indulgence, may be liable to many objections, both as it respects the means by which it is to work, and the results it is designed to produce. Like all laws of common daily application, as every man feels it, so every man will judge of it; and applaud or condemn, rather as it removes or disregards the inconvenience by which he practically suffers, than as it is calculated to answer the great national purpose which it labours to accomplish. But as there is no end of local objections, or suggestions for improvement, so they admit not of any answer. Against the difficulties which it may be supposed to cast upon overseers, particularly by multiplying the number and increasing the complexity of their accounts, I trust a sufficient remedy is provided in the aid of an assistant overseer, whose labours, if he is rightly chosen, will amply 1594 repay whatever salary he may receive.* It may also be urged, that it imposes fresh duties and additional responsibilities upon the local magistracy of the kingdom: I trust it will produce no such inconvenience. The regular arrangement of parish affairs, and the due ordering the real poor, which the bill aims at effecting, seem better calculated to lighten than to increase their official labours. But even if it should prove otherwise, I am persuaded that this invaluable body of men will be the last to complain. If benefits may accrue not only to themselves but to their country, and not only to the present but to future generations, they will spare neither pains nor labour to bring them within the reach of the people. It will possibly be objected, that the plan is better adapted to regulate the agricultural poor, than those of large towns and considerable manufacturing districts. As far as the objection arises from an application of the pauper's labour to highways and public works, it has some foundation. But the nicer employments of the manufacturer or artizan do not admit of this appropriation to public purposes: it is only the ruder and coarser kinds of labour that allow of such general regulation. On the other hand, as the manufacturer's wages are commonly higher, the power of apportioning relief, with reference to the pauper's industry, yields more than a counterbalancing advantage to manufacturing towns and districts: and as the means of saving are usually greater in such places, recourse to the parish rates will be less necessary, more especially if a prudent use is made of the wise institutions of saving banks. There is another objection which I am not a little anxious to repel. I may be accused of bringing forward regulations, which press with additional heaviness and severity upon the poor; as they tend to curtail the extent of relief, while they render the poor man's return for it more laborious and irksome. Sir, in throwing the imputation from me, I will say, that nothing can be more remote from my intention. My object, and it is one to me above price, is, to promote their comfort, to preserve their true spirit of independence, to cherish their domestic virtues, to chase away every lure to laziness and thoughtless dissipation. In this heavy, * Forms for keeping the accounts will be subjoined in an appendix to the bill.  1595 and perhaps ungrateful, task, it is necessary to winnow the chaff from the corn; to separate the idle from the industrious; to distinguish, by a clear line of demarcation, the prudent from the spendthrift; the moral from the profligate. Sir, he is no true friend to his kind who would keep them, as far as possible, unemployed. We may look to Ireland for the practical evils resulting from such a listless mischievous economy. The bread of labour is the bread of peace. When Providence made the sweat of man's brow the condition of his inheritance, alleviated the dispensation by soothing the ways of industry with that content and happiness, which to idleness and vice must remain for ever strangers. I mistake altogether both the provisions and the object of this bill, if it imposes injurious hardships, or severe discipline, on one. It professes no specific for sudden or violent amelioration. It holds out no prospects of unattainable advantage. Its object is, to follow in the paths of our predecessors, and by so doing to respect the feelings, the habits, the manners, the comforts, and the prejudices of the people. It is brought forward in the time of general peace, and in the season of domestic abundance, when the experiment, if it is to be ever hazarded, may be attempted with safety and a reasonable prospect of success. Sir, I am fully, aware that neither this nor any other measure can effect more than to devise means, and afford facilities, by which the country may extricate itself from this growing and monstrous evil. As this is the utmost which the legislature can accomplish, it is all that it should attempt; beyond this the nation must minister unto itself. It is upon the active perseverance and vigilant superintendence of the magistrates; upon the unremitting, unwearied, paternal attention of the landed and manufacturing interests; upon the persuasion, influence, and example of those who spare from their own wants, that which is to lighten those of others; and upon the cordial, cheerful co-operation of the poor themselves, that we must rely for any sound, substantial, and lasting improvement. Let us then earnestly call upon them all, both individually and collectively, to unite in one common effort to rescue themselves and their posterity from this calamitous pressure, and thus, rid their country of an incumbrance which clogs so heavily its prosperity and vigour. 1596  The hon. and learned gentleman concluded with moving.

Mr. Sadler		"Mr. Sadler rose to submit to the House his Motion for bettering the condition of the Labouring Poor, and began by observing upon the great importance of the subject, and the necessity of treating it in detail. He therefore, though very reluctantly, felt himself obliged to divide the subject; and, deferring to another occasion, and the first that might occur, the consideration of a measure in behalf of the manufacturing poor, he should then principally address himself to the state of the agricultural poor, with a view to ameliorating their condition. He disclaimed, in taking up these subjects, any pretension to superior benevolence, and in stating the reasons which had induced him to address himself, of late, principally to such matters, he must express a hope that the House would do justice to his motives in so acting. The subject, he maintained, was of paramount importance, however, com-  499 pared and considered. Paley had asserted it to be the first duty of the Legislature to take care of the poor; and a benevolent writer of a former century had emphatically declared, that, were a whole Session so employed, it would be spent more to the honour of God and the good of society than on any other subjects in which the noblest patriots could engage. ""If this,"" continued the hon. Member, ""were true in former times, and under ordinary circumstances, how stands the case at the present period? What is now the condition of your poor; and in the first place of your agricultural poor? It is a condition, the consideration of which you cannot evade if you would, and ought not if you could. Let those fears which have been but recently allayed, if, indeed, they can yet have subsided, teach us in time an impressive lesson. It would be a gross and fallacious libel upon the character of the industrious peasantry of England, heretofore the most contented and meritorious class of society among us, if the insubordination which has been but recently, if yet fully subdued, and which exhibited them at once reckless of crime and fearless of its punishment, has not a cause answerable in its character to the calamitous consequences it has occasioned. To doubt this, would be to give way to a grosser infatuation than any to which they have unhappily yielded. Let me illustrate this by one of the most striking and appalling incidents latterly recorded in our history. At a previous and hardly more alarming period than we have just witnessed, a similar spirit broke out among another important class of our countrymen I allude to the time when the Navy of England became mutinous. How did you act at that most trying moment? You put down, indeed, and with a strong hand, the alarming insubordination. But that done, you entered upon that which was equally your duty, and one which you ought previously to have discharged, when it would have spared the country the fear and shame with which it was then overwhelmed. You inquired into the wrongs of the British tars; you found them to be numerous and insupportable, and you redressed them. The rest need not be told. You performed your duty, and they did theirs how nobly, can never be forgotten: they went forth and wreathed the brow of their country with fresh and unfading laurels; they won those triumphs which had never previously been equalled, and 500 which will never be surpassed while England shall continue to have a name or a place among the nations. Sir, the agricultural peasantry are now prostrated: this then is the time to listen to their just complaints; this is the moment to redress their grievances; and it is a duty which sound policy, as well as humanity, will not allow to be postponed. Delay will render the attempt more difficult, and at last hopeless. No subject, I will venture to affirm, however important in itself or momentous in its results, is at all comparable in its urgency or magnitude to this the serious and timely consideration of the deplorable condition, with a view to its permanent amelioration, of the millions of our labouring, but suffering and degraded poor. What, Sir, is that condition? I have spoken, I think, of the difficulties of my present attempt, and I feel them most sensibly; but, alas, the making out my case, that of the sufferings and degradation of our labouring poor, is not one of those difficulties. Many other classes of society have, it may be hoped, advanced in the general career of human happiness and prosperity: this class, however, has visibly and lamentably retrograded; till at length few of those who compose it have anything left to surrender, anything further to fear. We live, Sir, in a period of great changes; but none of them, whether completed or in progress, and which still agitate society around us, at all equal in anything but name, the revolution which has taken place in the state and condition of our agricultural poor in many parts of the country, and which has hardly 'left a wreck behind' of all their former prosperity and happiness. Long placed in an enviable situation compared with those of any other country, from them our moralists drew their proofs of the equal dispensations of human happiness our poets, their loveliest pictures of simple and unalloyed pleasures our patriots, their best hopes as to the future destinies of the country; while their humble abodes, the cottages of England, surrounded by the triumphs of their industry, were as distinguished by their beauty as were their inmates for their cheerfulness and contentment. Hope still brightened this humble, but happy condition, and the prospect of advancement in life was then ever open to the peasant's persevering industry, and the means were within his reach. I need not trace this progress step by step; the path of prosperity was open to him, or to those dearer to him than himself, his children,  501 whom his exulting heart often beheld advancing to the very summits of society, to which they added dignity, the dignity of virtue and merit. Yes, Sir, I need not remind the House how many of those who have rendered immortal honour to their country how many of your greatest merchants how many laurelled and mitred heads, have sprung from the cottage? Such, then, was the situation of this class; what is it at present? The ""bold peasantry of England, their country's pride,"" are, generally speaking, now extinct. An ignorant and selfish system of spurious political economy, dictating first to the mercantile, and then to the agricultural interest, had at length triumphed, and these are its consequences. I shall attend to some of its dicta hereafter; meantime, let me now contrast the present condition to which the agricultural poor have been reduced, with that which I have described as enjoyed by them till its heartless dogmas prevailed. The system of demolition and monopoly, which has, in the emphatic language of the inspired volume, ""laid house to house, and field to field, that they may stand alone in the earth,"" has left no place for the poor, none for the little cultivator; none for the peasant's cow; no, not enough, in one case in ten, for a garden. The best of the cottages have been demolished ""spurned indignant from the green,"" as the loveliest of the poets of poverty, Goldsmith, sings. The lonely and naked hut into which they are now thrust, for which is exacted an exorbitant rent, is destitute, both without and within, of all that formerly distinguished their humble abodes, is often unfit to stable even quadrupeds, and frequently so crowded by different families, as to set not comfort merely, but decency at defiance, and render morality itself an impossible virtue. Thither, then, the unhappy parent, when employed, carries his wages, which, with the exception of a few short weeks in the year, are utterly inadequate to supply the necessities of a craving family. Wages did I say? Parish pay! He is, perhaps, sold by auction, as is the case in certain parishes, where he is actually reduced to the condition of a slave, or driven to the workhouse, where he is often treated worse than a felon. Labour meant to degrade and insult him is often prescribed to him; or, wholly unemployed, he sits brooding over his miserable fate; winter labour, whether for himself or his wife and children, 502 having been long since taken away. Perpetually insulted by false and heartless accusations for being a pauper, when his accusers have compelled him to become such; for being idle, when his work has been taken from him; for improvidence, when he can hardly exist he feels these insults barbed by past recollections which fasten in his heart which utter hopelessness withers within him. The very sympathies of his nature become reversed: those who would once have constituted his comforts and pleasures, his ragged and half-starved offspring, who cannot stray a pace from his hovel without becoming trespassers and being severely treated as such, they, with their wretched mother, increase his misery. He escapes, perhaps, from the scene of his distress, and attempts to lose the recollection of it and of himself, in dissolute and dangerous courses. Meantime, had some peculiar calamity, some inscrutable visitation of Providence reduced him to this condition, perhaps he might have sustained it with composure of spirit. But he knows otherwise. He can trace his sufferings and degradation to their true source. He knows they have been inflicted upon him, and he feels what would be their cure, and can calculate how little it would cost others to make him and his supremely happy. Meantime, the authors of his sufferings are those that insult him with demanding that he should be quiet and grateful, that he should be contented and cheerful under them! ""They that have wasted him, require mirth!"" Not only are the falsest accusations levelled at him, but even the feelings common to nature are imputed to him as an offence; his Marriage was a crime; his children are so many living nuisances; he himself is pronounced a redundancy; and after having been despoiled of every advantage he once possessed, he is kindly recommended as his best, and indeed only course to transport himself for life, for the good of his oppressors, and to die un-pitied and unknown in some distant wilderness. And this, Sir, is the condition at the present moment of thousands of tens of thousands of the labouring poor. Sir, I am neither following my imagination nor my feelings in this description I am embodying facts. The picture I have hastily drawn is not the work of fancy, nor is it exaggerated for the occasion: its darkest features are those which have been already presented to this House and the country by reports published by Committees of  503 Parliament, appointed to examine into and report upon the very condition in question. To some of these I shall speedily refer. In those public documents, Sir, are fully pourtrayed the degradation and destitution of the labouring poor in many parts of England, and the oppression and extortion under which they labour. And, Sir, have not recent events given their unequivocal and tremendous testimony to the truth of these statements? It is quite unnecessary for me to add my humble testimony to the truth of these representations; but having recently gone through several of the districts referred to, and often personally inspected the condition in question, I can safely answer for their truth. Imagination may depict, my language cannot, the scenes of distress accompanied by mingled despondency and irritation, which I have witnessed. Nor let it be concluded that this is the situation of the idle and profligate only, which too many are quite ready to call every unfortunate being who may happen to become poor and burthensome. No, Sir. It is one of the most dreadful characteristics of the present system, wherever it prevails, that the entire class are constantly confounded, and the whole of it doomed to one undistinguishable mass of misery. Finally, Sir, I must add, and I do so with unfeigned reluctance, but it is necessary to speak the real truth in order to rouse us to a sense of our duty, and quicken us in the discharge of it this state of things is remediable remediable by Parliament, which cannot, I fear, be held altogether guiltless of having permitted, if not produced it. Individually, I acquit them, and freely confess that in their personal and local sphere, the Aristocracy and landed proprietors of England are among the most attentive and benevolent individuals of the community; and that none are more anxious to prevent or to relieve the sufferings of the poor under their immediate notice and protection. But it is to those parts of the country, and they comprehend a vast proportion of its surface, which are far removed from their notice to which I particularly advert, where a false and pernicious system of management is suffered to prevail, and where the poor are consequently under the domination of a set of English middlemen, who often act as fully up to that character, and are as deserving of the name, as those of Ireland; and where a 504 system of cruelty, oppression and extortion prevails, which has at length placed the labourers in different parts on the utmost limits of endurance, and in many instances pushed them beyond it. Meantime, the evil is rapidly spreading, and must be remedied, or we are undone. When, therefore, we contemplate the multitudes of our agricultural poor who are already plunged into the state I have been describing, and know that the rest are rapidly sinking into it when we have been made to understand so fully, by recent and fearful experience, that it is a condition that cannot and will not be much longer endured I think policy, as well as humanity, will urge us to attempt a remedy for the ills of this important part of the people; and may not I add to these motives, those of justice and gratitude? When we recollect that it is this class that affords us our daily bread, and spreads our boards with the plenty we enjoy, can we remain any longer insensible to their privations and sufferings, and consent to muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn, and see it abused and goaded in its labours to deeds of desperation and destruction? But let us now inquire what are the causes which have produced this lamentable state of things; and it is the more necessary to ascertain these, as I am fully persuaded that the false views which have unhappily prevailed regarding them, have dictated the policy which has produced the evils we have been contemplating, and will, if not rectified, withstand the application of their only remedies. In this inquiry I shall confine myself as much as possible to those authentic and official documents, which have been put forth by the authority of this House on these important topics. Sir, I hold in my hand the report of the Select Committee on labourers' wages a document to which it is necessary that I should more particularly allude, as it pronounces upon the subject on which I am treating, with the express sanction and authority of this House. It is a document indeed of a most singular character, embodying evidence of a very important description, yet drawing from it, as it appears to me, deductions wholly irreconcileable with its general tenor. Premising that the miserable and degraded condition of the poor is fully set forth in this report, I will proceed to consider, as shortly as possible, the conclusions at which it arrived,  505 and which it presented to this House and the public; and it is the more necessary to examine them, as they have long been held as incontrovertible, and are repeated as such in pamphlets, and reviews, and speeches, whenever the subjects of the English labouring poor and their distresses force themselves upon the attention of our writers and speakers upon political economy. And, first, this report attributes a great part of the evil it points out, to the mal-administration of the Poor laws. This is the inexhaustible source of declamation with those who vainly hope to cripple or destroy the national charity in this country, or to prevent its extension to the other divisions of the British empire, both of which attempts will prove equally unavailing. I am not about to contend, that the institution is perfect, or that its administration is in all cases faultless; but I will maintain, that both one and the other are more free from all just imputation than any other establishment in the country. The misapplications of the national charity are not attributable to the law; they are rather the result of a conspiracy among the wealthier classes where such evils occur to evade it; and even where its benevolent code is so wrested as to oppress and degrade while it relieves, still, even in such cases, it still stands between the proud oppressor and the prostrate poor, and shields the latter from still greater miseries than they endure from Irish starvation! But, Sir, the official record before me, which, as I before mentioned, fully recognizes the miserable condition of the poor, assigning for it as a reason the supposed malversation of the Poor-laws, goes on to state, as the consequence, 'that thereby a surplus population is encouraged men know they have only to marry.' Aware, Sir, that these notions are not only generally, but almost universally prevalent; that they are taken as so many truisms and repeated as such; that they embody the notions of the political economists on this subject, who however widely they may differ, and however warmly they may disagree, are, nevertheless, on this topic, unanimous; and being perfectly aware that any general attempt to better the condition of the agricultural poor, if these positions were true, would not only be entirely fruitless, but even pernicious in its ultimate consequences, it is necessary, before I proceed, to examine these confident assertions; and I pledge 506 myself to this House to overthrow the whole of them, and exhibit them, as they in reality are, a set of the most egregious errors that ever darkened the understanding, or deadened the heart of man. I shall do this, not by reasoning, but by arithmetic by matters of fact; not by the selection of certain instances to serve my purpose, but by taking those selected by the Committee, doubtless, with a view of advancing its own. It is asserted, then, in this report, that the counties of Northumberland, Cumberland, and Lincoln, are nearly, if not totally, exempt from the malversation of the Poor-laws, which produce, according to its authority, these numerous marriages, and this increase of surplus population. The counties, on the other hand, where that malversation is stated to be most general, and where, consequently, the plague of marriage and population most prevails are particularised. They are these Suffolk, Sussex, Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Dorsetshire, and Wiltshire. Now, Sir, there were, during the ten years preceding the date of the last census, celebrated in the counties of Northumberland, Cumberland, and Lincoln, 45,288 marriages, the arithmetical mean of the population being in that term 606,600, or rather more than one annual wedding to every 133 of the inhabitants. But in the six counties in which we are to look for this great excess of marriages, there were, during the same term, on a mean population of 1,046,350 souls, 76,949 marriages, or one annual marriage in 136 only. But this comparison, though it decides the dispute, does not give the real truth in its just proportions; the practice of so many marriages in the border counties of Northumberland and Cumberland being celebrated across the boundaries a fact which Mr. Rickman has mentioned in those censuses (which are, in every point of view, an honour to the country as well as to his great industry and talents), as greatly diminishing the registered proportion of such marriages. To arrive, therefore, at a more just comparison, let us take, for instance, the county of Lincoln, which is stated to be free from the evils in question, and that of Dorset, which is particularised as one of those in which they are the most prevalent and oppressive, each of which, on the authority of an intelligent and humane witness, who had resided in both, deserves to be thus selected. Well, Sir, the marriages in Lin-  507 colnshire, computed as before, had for the preceding ten years been rather more than one in 128, while in Dorset the proportion was not as much as one in 144; so utterly groundless then, so entirely opposed to facts, are the allegations of this report. But, Sir, I will place the matter in another and yet stronger light, by presenting facts, still authentic and official, of such a character that defy all contradiction or evasion, and which will dispose at once and for ever of the stale and senseless accusations against the poor of these counties, where they are at once grievously oppressed and cruelly misrepresented. The report in question says, that the misery it describes, is 'in great part to be attributed to the maladministration of the Poor-laws during the latter years of the late war.' Let us examine the exact facts in this case also. Taking then the whole period of its duration, namely, that from 1803 to 1813, including and dividing it into two equal parts, of five years each, giving half the intermediate year 1808 to each, we shall find that the number of the marriages in Suffolk, Sussex, Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Dorsetshire, and Wiltshire, was 39,315 in the former half, while in the latter it amounted to 37,417 only. But the number of the marriages in the three counties which the Committee pronounce to be free from these malversations, advanced during the same period, from 22,081 to 23,227. If we take a still wider range in this examination, we shall find the results are precisely similar. Taking the average of the first two years of the late war (in order to avoid the casual fluctuations which might affect single ones), viz., those of 1803 and 1804, we find that the weddings amounted to 7836. I have already stated how much the marriages fell off in the latter period, in fact, in 1812 and 1813, the average number was 6774 only. And here I cannot refrain from pausing, to put a very important question. I ask, whether the malversation in the Poor-laws, and the consequent misery of the poor labourers, so strongly depicted in this report, namely, their living chiefly upon bread, or even potatoes, scarcely ever tasting meat or beer, or being able to buy milk, is a state justly attributed to the condition of agriculture during the same period whether the profits of that pursuit, and the price of all its produce during the latter part of 508 the last war would not have enabled the great cultivators, the farmers, to have afforded direct and sufficient Wages to their poor labourers, without degrading them as paupers, and partly starving them into the bargain? Shall I mention the average price of grain during this term. I need not. Let, however, this striking fact suggest to us this important conclusion, that no returning state of prosperity as regards the agricultural interests, will ever restore comfort and independence to the poor labourer, except this House comes in to his defence, and defeats a combination arrayed against him, compared with which he is utterly powerless. But when we extend the inquiry by a reference to the forthcoming census (which I have already diligently examined for this purpose), to the years immediately preceding the date of this report, those of 1822 and 1823, the average number of marriages in these two years will be found to be 7,767; consequently still less than it had been nearly twenty years before; and that of the terminating years of 1829 and 1830 will exhibit, I think, the same average as compared with the first still almost precisely stationary, though they ought to have advanced to upwards of 10,000, without showing any relative increase; the population of these counties (exclusive of Brighton, throughout the whole calculation) during these twenty-eight years, having increased upwards of thirty per cent. So entirely opposed to truth, therefore, are the assumptions of our economists regarding the habits and condition of our labouring poor, and so utterly, therefore, do they err as to the only means of remedying their distresses. But not to dwell further upon these pernicious mistakes, I will now proceed to prove, and from the pages of the very report which has given its authority to so injurious an error, that, notwithstanding the discouragements to which labour has been subjected in this country, our rural population is not, even yet, redundant; and, in doing so, I will confine myself to the simple facts published in this report, and those will abundantly suffice to negative the conclusion at which the Committee unhappily arrived. We find it there stated that, even as early as April, all the healthy labourers are employed; that April is a very busy time; and that from thence to the termination of the harvest the demand for labour increases, need not be mentioned; so much  509 so, indeed, that on turning to the agricultural surveys, I find that in the counties where so much is said of the redundancy of labourers, even the hay harvest could not be got in by the resident population without foreign assistance. But to come to the main question, and to determine it on the authority of the witness whom the Committee very properly place at the head of their list of witnesses, as having more minute and practical knowledge regarding what is called the market of labour, especially in the rural districts, than almost any other individual that could have been selected I mean Mr. M'Adam. To the first question put to him he replies, that he has had very considerable experience in hiring labour in the country. The second query is this 'Have you found in general that it is very easy to obtain labourers?' The answer: 'Generally speaking I have, excepting during the harvest months; we then find a great scarcity of workmen.' And yet, Sir, the Committee talk about the redundancy of agricultural labourers! Nor is this all. The agricultural labourers are not only not redundant; they are too few! Were it not for a large accession of workmen at the period of the harvest, much of the product of the land would never be secured. In addition to the influx of hands from towns and manufacturing districts, an immense assistance is also demanded annually from Ireland, or the harvests of England could neither be reaped nor gathered in. I need not, I presume, bring proofs of this fact, otherwise they could be easily obtained. I have myself consulted some of the managers of our great steam-boat companies, and I find from them, that there annually leave Ireland for the harvest fields of Great Britain, a number which I cannot calculate at less than the entire male adult population employed as agricultural workmen in some five or six of our English counties, though they are dispersed, it is true, through the whole of our corn districts. And if your fields could not be reaped, I need not say they would never be sown. It is, therefore, idle, worse than idle, for political economists, whether in this House or out of it, to rant about the redundancy of labour. It is not merely abhorrent to humanity, to reason as they do, it is an insult to truth, and an outrage upon common sense. Does such an infatuated feeling prevail in any other case 510 whatever? Does the sportsman deem his horses and his dogs redundant in the summer months the General call his soldiers superfluous while in their winter quarters? In the very commonest concerns of life is any such delusion witnessed? But when we come to talk of our labourers, the political economist determines whether they are in excess or otherwise, not by the demand for them in the season of the year when they are essentially necessary, but in that in which he imagines he can dispense with them altogether a method of computation which would make out a case against them as clearly as at present, were the population of the country reduced to a tenth of its present number. Nothing then can be more absurd and unjust than the present method of computing the alleged surplus of agricultural labourers. Under the best possible system, their labour will be less pressingly demanded in the winter than in the spring and harvest months. Nor is it, when duly considered, one of the least strikingly benevolent ordinations in nature, that the hardest and most essential operations of husbandry have to be performed in the finest periods of the year when the days are the most protracted and the weather the most temperate. Hence at all times, in every country, and under whatever system of cultivation, the ancient maxim will be found applicable, hyems ignava colono. In the natural order of things other industrious occupations have been reserved for this comparatively inactive and severe season, and have occupied it; of these, however, the industrious cottagers of England have been, in great measure, bereft, by causes over which they have had no control; and this circumstance, Sir, is it, that, among many others, has occasioned much of the distress under which they labour, and has furnished the apology for these perpetual declamations as to their redundancy. Still, however, as we cannot, in conformity with the new theory, annihilate them when we do not want their labour, because we cannot revive and multiply them when we do; and as nature has not indulged us with a human genus that can hybernate, or one which, after having secured the fruits of their industry, we can safely destroy when we have obtained its honey, as we once did their prototype, the bee; if, in short, we cannot gather in the kindly fruits of the earth, nor in due time  511 enjoy them, without our full agricultural force, then, Sir, notwithstanding all a selfish and stolid theory may repeat, the labourer whom our present system has deprived of all his comforts, and degraded so deeply in his character and feelings, is, at the very season we have doomed him to idleness and want, and would bid him if we could, to be gone, as necessary to us as our daily bread. Let us, then, proceed to develope the real causes of this afflicting, and I, may indeed say, alarming state of things, with a view to their ultimate removal. On entering upon this important branch of the subject I shall again once for all, assert that it is to the deserving and industrious poor those who always did, and ever would, most eagerly avail themselves of all those advantages which such once possessed, and of which they are now totally deprived that I exclusively refer. And let those who object to this classification, and wish to found an apology for the indiscriminate neglect and injury of the entire class, by confounding the character of the whole, point out in what respect the most meritorious of them have been favoured, and in what manner it is possible to benefit them under the present system; a system which dooms the whole to a state of indiscriminate suffering and degradation, because, as it assumes, some of them have deserved it. In tracing, then, the causes which have led to the present degradation of the labourers in husbandry, I must, however it may startle the prejudices of some, commence with the large farming system. Reason, it might have been supposed, would have dictated another course that, as the population of the country increased, the number of farmers should have augmented, or, as old Hobbes said, that 'they should live closer and cultivate better.' Political economy, falsely so called, advised however directly to the contrary; and, appealing as it ever does to human selfishness, prevailed. But in this, however, as in most other cases, its principles have been falsified by experience, and its prophecies have totally failed. The land has become less productive in large divisions, as it ever does; less capital has been applied to it, for labour is capital. A less surplus produce has been obtained for the public; for this is determined by the fact that a smaller rent is received by the landlord, and that less punctually and certainly; and, after all, the expense of 512 keeping up a few additional farm-houses has been far more than counterbalanced by the great addition to the poor-rates, which the farmer has taken care should at length fall upon the landlord. On this highly important and interesting topic I had collected a considerable mass of statistical proofs; but I cannot now presume even to enumerate them. I will, however, state, that the experience of every agricultural country is clear and full upon this point. In Flanders the size of the farms has been, consequently, long limited by law, but, as one of its most intelligent writers observes, the experience of the superiority of the minuter system has had the effect of still further curtailing their size and multiplying their number. In Italy, where the state of cultivation is presented in such wide extremes, an able practical agriculturist of our own country comes to this conclusion, that 'every state in the Peninsula is productive or otherwise, in proportion to the number of farmers on a given space of land of equal quality.' In France such also is precisely the fact, as I can confidently assert, having most accurately examined the Cadastre for that purpose. This fact is beginning also to be seen in England, and will be demonstrated more clearly every day, even by pecuniary considerations alone. I am not arguing that farms here should be limited by law, or that they should all be reduced to one, and that a small extent; far otherwise. What I would contend for is the superiority of that moderate and mixed system of husbandry, which leaves the deserving peasantry of the country the opportunities and hopes of ultimate advancement; and this I believe to be far the most profitable state: that it is the happier one, as regards the great bulk of the people, not a doubt can exist. Hence Paley classes among his deeds of benevolence the splitting of farms. But, Sir, what I have to do with the question, at present, is, to show that the system of 'engrossing great farms,' to use Bacon's expression, has been among the first of a series of connected causes which have led to the present degradation of our labouring poor. I shall not advert to past times, when the same practice is described by our authentic historians as having led to such fatal consequences; the present are sufficient for my purpose. No one can take up the work of any agricultural theorist, if published some time  513 ago, but he will find the most pressing recommendations to the land-owners to increase the size of their farms, and the most tempting calculations to induce them so to do. Meantime, there was an equal unanimity as to the advantage of such a course, even to the little cultivators themselves; they were to do abundantly better as labourers than as small farmers. They valued, indeed, their independent state; they were reluctant agonized I may say, in every instance at the thought of being driven from their holdings, but they were compelled to submit. The village Ahabs seized upon the vineyards of their industry, and their destruction was complete. The numerous class of little cultivators, or as they might be called, independent or free labourers, being thus extinguished, let us trace their condition into that class whose numbers they greatly augmented the dependent or servile labourers, as I fear they may be too justly denominated. Two ranks only existing, let us see next how these labourers have been treated to whom such large and consoling promises had been held forth. Why, Sir, still the plea of public improvement was advanced, improvement of which they were again to be the sole victims; I now allude to the manner in which the inclosures of the commons and wastes of the country were carried into effect, which comprised, within a comparatively short period of time, so large a part of the entire surface of the kingdom. I am not about to contend, that inclosures should not have taken place; on the contrary, I would have had them become universally prevalent; one general inclosure Act, as was often urged, ought to have been passed for that purpose; then, it was often said, the ancient and sacred rights of the poor labourers would have been secured, and just reservations made for them in mortmain placed under the management of every parish the only way of preserving their rights and privileges as a class; but, alas, all such inclosures were made by the wealthy and interested parties, and their humbler rights, equally recognised by justice and sound policy, were totally disregarded. Sir, I contend that the poor cottagers and labourers had an equitable, if not a legal right, agreeable to the known principles of the British law. If it be argued that their claims could only be founded, in many cases, upon usurpations, as the law would denominate them, so, it should be recollected, are all the rights 514 of property among us, at least as expounded by a fiction of that law. The tenants in capite encroached upon the Crown; the lesser upon the greater Barons; the smaller proprietors, especially the copyholders, upon the Barons. Indeed, it is calculated by Barrington, in his work on our Ancient Statutes, that not many centuries ago, half the lands of England were held upon the degrading tenure of villeinage; and, though the state that term implied, or the galling conditions it imposed, were never abolished by statute, it gradually ceased by force of long usage. Thus has custom ratified those rights of possession which grew up imperceptibly among us, prescribing accordingly the appropriation of all property not yet in severally. Thus, if a royal forest has to be inclosed, the contiguous parishes, or rather proprietors, demand their share, on the ground that they have depastured upon it. They urge their claims, ""and have those claims allowed."" But shall we not blush for ourselves and our country, when we observe at what precise point it is, that this principle stops that those essential rights, interests, advantages, call them what you please, which ought on every plea, whether of justice, humanity, or policy, to have been liberally considered and fully secured, have been altogether slighted and sacrificed; that land which had not been appropriated since it was created, was, when divided, dealt to the wealthy alone, and in shares proportioned to their wealth, to the total exclusion of the claims of the poor; and that in those cases where, according to Locke's doctrine, they had obtained a sort of natural right to their little cot, with its inclosure, by having obtained it by their own labour, and in some sort created it even then, as he indignantly exclaims, the rich man, who possessed a whole county, seized when he pleased upon the cottage and garden of his poor neighbour, in contempt of what, had they been as fully traced, and as well asserted, would have been found to be rights which ought to have been as sacred as his own. I am aware that I am now taking a most serious view of this subject. God forbid, however, that I should pursue this course with any other view than that of inducing the Legislature to look into this matter, and then it will, I am sure, make some restitution (and moderate, indeed, will be all that I shall propose, and involving no sacrifice of property whatever) for the in-  515 juries sustained by the poor in this to them important matter. I shall, therefore, persist in showing, on authorities as well conversant with the common law of the country, and the rights in question as any, I think, that now exist, that the Inclosure Acts, as they have been carried into effect, have been inconsistent with the principles of law as well as with equity and mercy. I will first quote the earliest legal author who wrote specially upon inclosing, or, as he expresses it in the legal phrase which still survives, approving; and one who was also a practical agriculturist Sir Anthony Fitzherbert, the celebrated lawyer and Judge. He thus lays down the law on the occasion, in his book of Surveying. 'Every cottager sal have his portion assigned him, and then sal not the ryche man overpresse the poore man.' Sir Robert Cotton, of the same profession, and who also wrote expressly upon the subject inclosing, speaks thus: 'In the carriage of this business there must be much caution to prevent commotion;' he recommends, therefore, that plots shall 'be devised to such inhabitants, and at and under easy values.' Lord Chancellor Bacon, strenuously urging the same agricultural improvement, couples, it however, with this momentous condition 'So that the poor commoners have no injury by such inclosures.' The total neglect, however, of their rights in all such proceedings called forth the strongest reprobation of a succeeding Chancellor, who termed the system as pursued ""a crime of a crying nature."" I have adverted to Locke's energetic expressions on the subject, and shall pass over many others, only adducing one more authority of a modern date, and of an official character. It is that of a report drawn up, I believe, by the excellent and patriotic Sir John Sinclair, whose long life has been devoted to the service of his country, of a select Committee of the House of Commons, appointed for the special purpose of considering the subject, which clearly recognises these rights of the poor, and most strongly recommends that they should be secured. 'If' says the report, 'a general bill were to be passed, every possible attention to the rights of the commoners would necessarily be paid. The poor would then evidently stand a better chance of having their full share undiminished.' I will not multiply these authorities; suffice it to say, that all such have held the pri- 516 vileges the poor formerly possessed in the light of sacred rights, and have earnestly contended for the necessity of their preservation; these, however, have been now almost entirely wrested from them by a series of private inclosure bills, inflicting upon them, as a class, the most irreparable injuries. Inclosures, indeed, might have been so conducted as to have benefitted all parties; but now, coupled with other features of the system, they form a part of what Blackstone denominates a ""fatal rural policy;"" one which has completed the degradation and ruin of your agricultural poor. Formerly the industrious labourer had this means of advancement; to this remaining privilege, also, the ejected little farmer could resort, but at the same time, and under the same system that some village monopolist seized upon his fields, he drove him also from the waste. ""If to some common's fenceless limits strayed, He drives his flock to pick the scanty blade, Those fenceless fields the sons of wealth divide, And e'en the bare-worn common is denied."" Now, Sir, it was from the first so obvious, notwithstanding all the interested and selfish declarations to the contrary, that inclosures, as they were carried into effect, would be greatly injurious to the industrious poor, that it hardly seems necessary to prove how truly these fears have been verified. I will, however, just mention that the report of a Committee on inclosures, in 1808, states, that the results which were the subject of examination in a tour of 1,600 miles, made for that purpose, proved that they had been clearly injurious to the poor. An intelligent witness informs another Committee of this House, namely, that which sat to inquire into the high price of provisions, that he had himself been a Commissioner under twenty inclosure Acts, and states his opinion as to their general effect on the poor, lamenting that he had been thereby accessary to injuring 2,000 poor people, at the rate of twenty families per parish. I fear, sir, the reply of a poor fellow to Arthur Young, the great advocate of inclosures (though under regulations which would indeed have rendered them a benefit to all parties) recorded in one of his agricultural surveys, is true to a more or less degree of every industrious labourer in England, wherever these improvements have taken place. To his query as to whether the inclosure had injured him, he replied,  517 'Sir, before the inclosure I had a good garden, kept two cows, and was getting on; now I cannot keep so much as a goose, and am poor and wretched, and cannot help myself, and still you ask me if the inclosure has hurt me!' Nor, Sir, has the system in question stopped even here. Another, and if possible, a still deeper injury which it has also perpetrated, still remains to be noticed. Not only has the little farm been monopolised, the common right destroyed, the garden in many instances seized, but the cottage itself demolished; and the plough-share now drives over many a little plot where once stood the bower of contented labour. A few blooming shrubs are still seen twining round in the fence, and here and there a flower, tenacious of the soil, blossoms in its season upon the spot which was once the abode of peace and happiness; like those which grow upon the grave of some forgotten, but once loved being though the hand which planted them is also gone for ever. I am presenting, Sir, no imaginary or solitary cases no, these demolitions have been, as Lord Winchilsea observed in his communications to the Board of Agriculture, many years ago, most numerous; and, not content with the opportunities these inclosures gave them, the great agriculturists have, in not a few instances, combined and subscribed to forward this work of destruction; and it has even been gravely propounded as a question in this House, or at least in its Committees, whether direct legal means ought not to be employed to hasten it forwards. There has been no occasion the work is accomplished. Those have prevailed who have pronounced the labouring poor to be redundant, and whose nests, therefore, as human vermin, were to be cleared; hence their humble abodes have been demolished. The foxes, indeed, might have holes, and the birds of the air nests, but these Christian philosophers would not let a poor man have where to lay his head. Three results have followed, any one of which is perfectly decisive as to the condition of the poor. First, Sir, their present cottages are often of a most wretched description; ""spurned indignant from the green,"" they are placed at a distance, so as to ""screen the presence of contiguous pride;"" miserably deficient in necessary accommodation, almost always destitute of a good and sufficient garden; in a word, the wretched inmates, and the hovels into which they are thrust, are 518 worthy of each other miserable to the last degree. Secondly, and to this I call the most serious attention of this House and of the country, as an evil demanding an instant and effectual remedy, if there be any sense of decency or humanity left among us, these huts, miserable as they are, are rendered still more miserable by being deficient in number: there are not enough of them; hence more than one family are often thrust into the same dwelling, to the utter destruction of all peace, comfort, and decency. Sir, on this most important point I proceed to prove what I assert namely, that we have, by the operation of causes which I have been enumerating, most cruelly diminished the accommodation for our poor labourers; and I shall do so, not by vague authorities, or opinions in pamphlets and books on political economy, but by authentic and indisputable facts, which at once decide the subject. I shall take the first county which is presented to us in the report, and which seems, on the testimony of one of the witnesses, to be well entitled to that bad pre-eminence namely, Suffolk. Suffolk, Sir, has, in the course of 120 years, increased in population, including the great increase of some of its towns, as much as eighty per centum, and rather more. What has been the increase in the accommodation for the poorer part of the population? Why, Sir, in 1690, there were 47,537 houses in that county: in 1821, then, there ought to have been at least 90,000 houses. But, alas, Sir, there were in the latter year only 42,773 inhabited houses, the absolute number being eleven per cent fewer than 130 years before. The whole of the six counties so selected exhibit a result, in this respect, not quite so appalling, but sufficiently distressing, however regarded. Their population, had from 1701 to 1821, advanced upwards of seventy-five per cent, but the houses for its accommodation less than twenty-five. It is unnecessary to remark on what class the misery of such a state of things would be made to rest. Even in counties supposed by this Committee free from this state of things, ""th' infection works."" I hold in my hand the invaluable pamphlet of the Vicar of Alford, in Lincolnshire, who enumerates fifteen neighbouring parishes in which he found, on diligent inquiry, that the comfortable agricultural cottages demolished since 1770 amount to 176, and that nine only  519 have been built since that period. But to return to one of the former counties: I will present to this House, in the instance of a single parish, and that not one selected for the occasion, the facts and consequences of such a system. It is described in a letter from the Vicar of a place which I shall not name, but an extract from which I shall read to the House. It is situated in one of the disturbed districts. 'During the last forty years,' says the reverend Gentleman, 'four cottages only have been built by * * * *, and even these in lieu of the same number taken or fallen down. The accommodation for the poor is far more confined than it was some years past. The old parsonage, which I rebuilt when I came to the living, I found inhabited by four pauper families. There were also, a short time previously, five pauper families in two farm-houses, now occupied again by farmers. The want of room, therefore, has created the greatest difficulties to the Overseers, and has rendered their office peculiarly painful. For several weeks they have been compelled to quarter a poor family at the public house, two of the young men being under the necessity of sleeping in a barn. In some of the cottages the poor are so huddled together that the sight is most distressing, and the effect, of course, very demoralizing. The following is a specimen:  520  521 For these accommodations, wretched as they are, the most exorbitant rents, exorbitant in reference to what they are worth (that is often, literally speaking, nothing) or for the little patch of garden ground when they have any, are exacted; a fact which has been fully verified both by agricultural reports and surveys, and by witnesses before your own Committees, and is fully known and undisputed. Indeed, it has necessarily happened, that the more the cottages have been diminished in number, the more have their rents been increased (a consequence which the economists themselves will allow to have been inevitable) till they have, at length, compared with every other species of property, become exorbitant, compelling the wretched tenant to resort to the parish for the means of paying them; leaving him, therefore, the disgrace of being a pauper, but, depriving him at the same time of the relief he should receive as such. I now come to another principal branch of the subject namely, that which concerns the wages and employment of the poor. But on this point, important as it plainly is, time will compel me to be short. When the improvements, as they have been called (and might have been rendered), in the agricultural system took place, and the labouring classes were deprived of their little holdings, their commonage, and often their good gardens, they were told, that the demand for their labour would be so greatly increased, and its wages, consequently, so much advanced, that they would be infinitely better off under the new plan. But, Sir, it no longer admits of a dispute, that while they have thus been deprived of their independant labour, that which they yield to others is rendered, as far as possible less necessary and worse remunerated. In summer or harvest, as I have before shown, their work is indeed demanded; but it is to the winter, the trying season to the poor, that I am now about to advert. First, Sir, the altered practice of hiring servants by the week, instead of, as was formerly the case, by the year, has had a pernicious effect on the winter employment of the poor. The report I have so often alluded to, when referring to the northern counties as those in which the condition of the poor is still comparatively comfortable, should have stated (had the Committee known it), that this practice still prevails in the border counties of England, to the equal comfort and ad- 522 vantage of all parties. Secondly, the threshing-machine has, as far as possible, dispensed with a great part of the winter employment of the labourers, and, all the incidental expenses duly considered, without, as far as I have been able to calculate, any advantage whatever to the farmer, or to the public. I speak not thus as an apologist for the attacks that have been made upon this description of property; far otherwise; but with the hope of inducing the agriculturists to count well the costs before they sanction (where it is unnecessary) that which will inevitably distress and pauperise the poor. Lastly, and to this particular I would draw the attention of the House, as of infinite importance in any view of the causes of the distress of our rural poor the improvements of the machinery of this country, and the consequent transference of the simplest processes of manufacture to the large towns of England, have had the inevitable result of depriving the female part of the cottagers' family of that profitable employment which presented itself, indeed, at every vacant hour throughout the year, but which secured to them a constant occupation in the winter season. A late Flemish writer exults in the circumstance of the winter cottage labour in that country being still preserved in great measure; and he attributes to that fact the comfort of their rural population. That is no longer the case in England, nor perhaps can ever be again. Let us, then, be the more anxious to consider how we may compensate this great and necessary class of the community for this connected series of deprivations and misfortunes, which have occasioned the misery which now overwhelms them. Thus, then, have our rural poor been successively deprived of every advantage which they formerly possessed, and of every chance of improvement which they once were so eager to avail themselves of. But I will no longer fatigue the House by these details. I may, however, be, perhaps, permitted to present in a single instance, and that not a selected one, the state to which I would draw the attention of the House. I have personally inspected the condition of the agricultural poor in some of the districts I have alluded to. I remember the last cottage I entered, and it was by no means the deepest picture of distress that might have been selected, on the contrary, there was nothing in it of peculiar disease, calamity, or sorrow.  523 In this I witnessed a fair but instructive example of the general state of many of the agricultural poor in that neighbourhood. All the furniture consisted of a few utensils for cooking, and a few three-legged stools, evidently of home make, and a large one of the same description, which answered the purpose of a table, and from which they took their meal. That meal was cooking, and it consisted of a few potatoes boiling over a handful of sticks. I went into the remaining apartment I was about to call it a bed-room but there was no bed; a few rags were lying upon a little straw in one corner, and there the whole family, several of whom were nearly grown up, rested without taking off their clothes. The wretched parent had no work, but the threshing-machine was resounding close at hand. I remarked, however, that he had a garden, though a small one; but I was soon told, that what I saw belonged to three cottages, and that his share was marked by a row of sticks, and it was certainly not the size of this floor. But I will not recapitulate the sad, but true complaints of this wretched peasant: his want of a garden and a pig. His father had a cow. There was no winter labour for either himself or family. His wife and his daughters (two females nearly full-grown) no longer wove lace, or knitted, or spun, as his mother and sisters had done. All was wretchedness and despair. On inquiry, I found his rent was 3l. 6s. per annum one shilling was taken weekly, and the rest made up in the harvest months. He was, of course, like the rest of his poor neighbours, a pauper. The parish, however, employed him, but so as to insult him. He and others had to carry stones of a certain size backwards and forwards, a distance of about three miles, twice a-day. The land was evidently deteriorating for want of due cultivation; but, in the mean time, neither by the proprietors, nor by the farmers, could he be spared so much as a rood for a garden plot. He was perfectly stupified by his condition, and if he did not proceed to outrages which many others were committing in that neighbourhood, I speedily found that it was not because he was insensible to his sufferings, or at all afraid of the consequences of resenting their infliction. But I will not dwell upon the melancholy subject; this deplorable and desperate condition was that of the neigh- 524 bourhood I fear, of the district; nor would I have alluded to the subject at all, but that I am firmly persuaded there are easy and effectual remedies for this strange and alarming state of things. What, then, are those remedies? Sir, the measure I am about to propose, is not, if I may so express myself, a tentative one, a plan of mere experiment: it is founded upon no new discoveries in human nature or policy; no novel or untried expedients; no distant or doubtful remedies. It does not contemplate to send off the thews and sinews of the country to the antipodes, the equator, or the pole, in search of relief. Nor does it include the locating of our labouring poor upon our waste lands, though that scheme, carried into practice to a certain extent, I hold to be a much wiser and patriotic scheme than many usually recommended regarding them. As a general plan of relief, I think it is, however, liable to some objections, which I shall not now state. The plan I propose contemplates to repair the injuries which our labouring poor have sustained in the scenes where they have been inflicted, to the equal advantage of every class of the community; and by means, as I hope to show, perfectly simple and practicable, and imposing, permanently considered, no burthen whatsoever upon us in its execution. Sir, there will be no novelty in any of my propositions, except that of requiring that Legislature, which has been, in some measure, an accessory to the injuries of the poor, to afford those facilities which shall render them universal, and the miseries of your agricultural poor, and the insubordination which they occasion, are at an end. First, I propose that a certain number of cottages should be rebuilt in those parts of the country where they are most wanted; which being the only part of the measure demanding an outlay worth a thought, I had for some time meant to have postponed, but after due consideration of the subject myself, and having had numerous communications with others most impressed with the present condition of the poor, I came to the conclusion that no plan whatever, for the relief of our agricultural poor, has the least chance of affording them any adequate relief, if this proposition be omitted. A cottage, according to a calculation I have made, might be erected, and have, at least, its rood of ground around it as a garden, and let to the cottager at 50s. per annum, and still pay a  525 higher interest than any other description of real, or even funded property among us. Still less would be the cost, were Government, without sacrificing any real income, to facilitate the measure as I shall hereafter suggest. Here there is accommodation of an infinitely superior kind to that now usually enjoyed, affording a rent which would allow ample reservations for repairs or other purposes, at one half, nay, one third, of the sum usually paid to the thoughtless sub-landlord, or griping speculator, whom the present system allows to live upon the poor-rates, rather than the pauper labourer whom he makes his agent for that purpose. The erection of even a very few of these cottages, where they are most needed, would not, I am hardly required to say, merely afford so many additional and improved accommodations to the degraded poor, and even in doing that, the benefit would be incalculable but, Sir, these would inevitably have a most surprising and gratifying effect upon the rest, in improving the accommodations, and consequently, morals and comforts, of the poor; secondly, in greatly lessening their extortionate rents; and thirdly, in proportionally reducing the poor rates, a large part of which, in many places, goes to make good these infamous exactions. The difficulty of raising means, in this land of wealth and humanity, for so humble an effort, I will not for one moment regard. Four methods I have contemplated, all of which, I am confident, would be available, and any one of which would amply suffice for the purpose; but should those all fail, where would be the difficulty of Government, granting a small loan, secured by the respective parishes at the usual interest, which parishes would possess the property, to their own great and obvious advantage, as well as to that of the poor? For this plan, so important to the poor in every possible point of view, not one farthing then would be given, not one farthing risked by either the parish or the country. The second feature of my measure, Sir, is still more easy; it is this the giving, or rather restoring, by the means, and in the manner I shall speedily point out, to the labouring poor, at least to those deserving and desirous of an advantage gardens, not gratuitously, indeed, but at the full value at which the lands are let where they are situate, and no more. Sir, this simple restitution would effect of itself 526 wonders in their behalf; the revival of cottage horticulture would yield additional employment to the peasant, and especially at those seasons of the year when he is now often without it; it would increase his comforts, and go far to restore to him plenty at all seasons. By gardens, I mean not the barren and overshadowed patch that may be still sometimes left at the back or in front of some of the ruinous cottages of the country, sufficient, perhaps, to grow a shrub or two on which the wretched inmates can hang a few rags to dry: such, Sir, only mock and tantalize the industry which they can neither excite nor reward. Such will, and ought to be, neglected. I mean by a garden, a good and sufficient garden. The circumstance of any of the cottagers of England being devoid of these, especially in the present condition of the country, would not be credited, were it not so notorious a fact as no longer to excite curiosity or remark. Certainly, such a circumstance, were we unacquainted with the real cause, would be attributed at once to the disinclination nay, refusal of the poor to avail themselves of the employment and advantages which horticulture affords. And, Sir, when we consider the state of the poor, their involuntary idleness and wretchedness, and the moral and political consequences of their condition, and know that this one pursuit would relieve them and the country of many of the evils under which both now labour were the poor destitute of any wish to avail themselves of it, no national sacrifice could be too great, hardly any sum (burthened as the country is) too vast, could a decided taste for horticulture be purchased for our agricultural poor. Sir, the poor of England have this taste passion, I may even call it, in them, for gardening, beyond any other people upon earth. Sir, what will they not do to gratify it, even now, when the in closures in every part of the country have rendered it almost impossible for them to find the means of gratification? Who has not seen the thousands of little strips which the poor labourers have taken in by the road sides in this country, the labour of inclosing which, estimated at the lowest wages, is often many times the amount of the worth of the narrow plot thus obtained; though the industrious peasants know that they are at any time liable to have their plot seized, and are certain that, at some time or other, it will be so?  527 Few of the poor, however, have the opportunity, or would have the permission, to obtain even this little advantage; it is true, the great farmer may allow them occasionally the temporary possession of a distant headland, on which to plant a few potatoes. But, Sir, this, wherever situated, is not the advantage I ask for this class; it is the garden, properly so called, which the husbandman can call his own, in which he can display his taste and cultivate as he pleases; and where, surrounded by his family, he labours not only for present but prospective advantages; where the feelings of hope and the consciousness of prosperity are alive within him, rendering him as happy as his master feelings which, alas! are seldom gratified. But I will proceed upon this subject no further. The poor, every one must know, have the taste in question. They are fully aware of the pleasures and advantages attending its gratification; and they bitterly complain of having been dispossessed of the possibility of obtaining small spots of ground for cultivation. They have, in thousands of instances, besought their superiors to restore to them their garden, as in other days. They have constantly prayed for this great favour. It has been denied! ""They mourn in their prayer and are vexed."" Sir, I have here a calculation, made by one of the ablest of our agricultural writers, of the advantages, estimated in the most moderate way possible, of a good garden to the industrious labourer: but I have not time to enumerate them, interesting and important as they are. But I would not rest here. No advantages, however valuable, if indiscriminately extended, would fully answer the ends we ought to have in view regarding this class: nor, indeed, can any rank of society, no, nor any individual, whatever be his pursuit, be incited to those becoming exertions, on which human prosperity, individual and national, depends, without holding forth further adequate inducements and rewards to successful efforts. I would then propose, as a reward and distinction to the deserving poor, what would indeed be to them no empty honour, but the highest possible advantage, though still it would involve no pecuniary sacrifices whatever, I would propose to restore to such the opportunity of keeping a cow, on customary terms. These cottagers would have to be selected for their good conduct, industrious habits, 528 and honest endeavours to bring up their families without parochial relief. They would have to be admitted tenants of little intakes, or to depasture upon a general allotment, and they must have a meadow appropriated for the purpose of providing them with hay. Either of these plans might be adopted, and both of them have been so with great success; that, however, which gives the cottager his own share in severally is undoubtedly to be preferred. I have contemplated the difficulty which, in certain instances, the most deserving and industrious of our labourers would have in raising sufficient money for this purpose. This difficulty, however, is more apparent than real, and may be obviated, as I will on another occasion show, when I hope to enter more into the details, and less into the principle, of the measure, with equal advantage to all parties, A point far more material to mention is, that the measure contemplates securing the advantages proposed, whether for keeping the cow or the garden, at the current and usual terms of land of equal quality in the same district, and let by the same owners. And I am ashamed of acknowledging how necessary is this provision; otherwise that extortion to which the poor are now exposed would pursue them again. I have ascertained beyond all doubt, that in those few instances where the poor now obtain, or have been suffered to retain, the advantages in question, they too frequently pay for them, on the average, more than double what is demanded from the larger tenants in the immediate neighbourhood. If these advantages be secured to the little cultivator, I will engage for the effects. Happiness will be conferred upon the class in question, and their superiors will also be rewarded; for to the arguments which justice and generosity suggest, those which self-interest supplies may be fairly added. This plan would diminish the burthen of the poor-rates, now so heavily felt in many of the agricultural districts of this country; and this most important consequence, I proceed to shew, would take place, from instances in which a similar plan has been put into operation by means of private benevolence. The instance I shall first adduce is that which occurred in the parish of Long Newton, in the county of Gloucester, where the excellent and benevolent father of the present member for the University of Oxford, the late Mr. Estcourt, stated  529 that, out of 196 persons, thirty-two families, consisting of 140 persons, were poor, and indeed in the depth of extreme poverty, to use his own words. The poor-rates amounted to 324l. 13s. 6d. In order to extricate them from this state of misery and wretchedness, he adopted a plan in some respects similar to the one I now propose; and what have been the consequences? An immediate abatement in the misery of the poor; the most gratifying improvement in their character and morals; and a progressive diminution in the poor-rates down to 135l., in 1829 (the last year reported), amounting to 10d. in the pound only, on the valuation of the parish in 1815. In Skipton-moyne, an adjoining-parish, where the same course is pursued, I find the poor-rates have diminished between 1813 and 1829, from 367l. to little more than 209l. on the average of the last three years. In the small parish of Ashley, where the present excellent, member for Oxford University has also pursued the same course since 1812, I find that the poor-rates, which then stood at 89l. in the year 1813, have now dropped to 55l., or 101/4d. in the pound. In other parishes the same effect is taking place under the same auspicious direction. But, perhaps, it may be said, that every plan of benevolence, of whatever character or description, is found to answer under the warm and enthusiastic management of its patron. To show that this system of benevolence does not depend upon mere superintendence, I will, lastly, give another instance where the cottagers have been allowed these privileges for at least 200 years; for at that time an in closure took place, and the then owners had the good sense and humanity to reserve a small allotment for the purpose of letting it to the cottagers at moderate rates. A gentleman who communicated this fact to the Board of Agriculture, above thirty years ago, through Lord Winchilsea, says, as a natural consequence of such a system' 'We can, therefore, 'hardly say that there are any industrious 'persons here who are really poor, as there 'are in places where they have not this 'advantage.' This communication was made in 1796, and I have been anxious to see the effect of this system, imperfect as it is in some respects, on the poor-rates. I find that, on the average of the last seventeen years, namely, during the period in which we have had annual returns, the amount averaged 25l. 4s. 8d. only; or, on 530 the valuation of 1815, rather more than 41/2d. in the pound; or perhaps 1d. in the pound on the value of the whole produce of the parish. Would the most parsimonious manager of the poor require a less demand upon the national or parochial funds than this? In two other instances, one a village in Lincolnshire, and another in Worcestershire, the same management has produced equally beneficial results. I had meant to have given some equally authentic proofs of the individual happiness this system creates wherever it has been partially introduced; but time will not admit. To the poor in particular, to use the language of a most intelligent correspondent of the Board of Agriculture, 'the advantage is so great, as to baffle all 'description.' May it be the business of this House, as it is its evident duty, to make that happiness universal! One other provision I would propose in favour of the poor in districts where it would be needed. I have said much of the want of winter labour for the poor, and of the depression of wages, and consequent pauperism and degradation which exists in consequence of this state of things in several parts of the country. Gardens for the whole, and homesteads for a part, of the labouring poor, would, I am convinced, do much, very much, to remedy these evils at once; perhaps, however, not enough to protect those from the pernicious custom, which degrades, in certain parts, the labouring poor, to whom work, after all, is bread. Employment might, therefore, in certain cases be still wanted, and, in far more, adequate remuneration for the employed, and these are objects, as I take it, very easy to be accomplished. The celebrated law of Elizabeth, I need not say, prescribed that labour should be furnished for the able but unemployed poor; and to effectuate this, it contemplated the establishing parochial manufactures on the domestic system. And this was then a wise and practicable plan, as most of the manufactures of the country, at least in their initial stage, were then pursued in the cottage. And see, Sir, what a vast and expensive task our ancestors undertook in their measure of providing employment for the poor. They contemplated the general advance of capital, the purchase of stocks whereon to employ the numerous unemployed poor, and that superintendence which was necessary for realising such a scheme. Compared with all this, the plan I should pro-  531 pose, would be easy, and the burthens it would impose upon the community would be indeed light. But to return; all the writers on this great subject, for at least half a century afterwards, such as Sir Joshua Child, Sir Matthew Hale, John Locke, and many others, placed their projects on the manufacturing basis, properly so called. The workhouses first erected in considerable numbers about a century ago, proceeded upon the same idea, and have led to greater evils, and occasioned a greater additional expense, in managing the poor, than any other part of the existing practice. Fully aware that they are occasionally well and humanely managed (and an exemplary instance occurs in the town where I reside), still, on the whole, the system is a crying evil, and demands immediate revision. Manufacturing labour (properly so called) being, therefore, totally out of the question, it follows, that what Montesquieu emphatically calls ""the universal manufacture,"" the culture of the soil, is the only resource that remains for this important purpose, and happily for us it is of all others that which is most adapted to the peculiar wants and condition of the country. We have lands enough, and, as some contend, hands too many; surely, then, there can be no hesitation whether, or in what manner, we shall employ those whom we are otherwise compelled to sustain in idleness. The desiderata on this branch of the subject are these: first, to increase employment without improperly interfering with the general market of labour; secondly, to sustain at a just remunerating price the value of the labour of those who are willing and anxious to work for their subsistence; thirdly, to compel those to labour who would otherwise seek to be maintained in voluntary idleness. All these objects, each of which are so desirable, might be secured by taking a parochial allotment of land, and cultivating it by spade husbandry. To the employment thus created, the unemployed might and would repair; those also who were offered totally inadequate wages, such as would eventually send them to the parish to make them up to a living amount, would resort to the same lawful means of avoiding pauperism and oppression; and, lastly, those who wish to subsist without labour on the parochial funds, would be by this means prevented so doing. In 532 such a country as this, demanding as it does so enormous an importation of the necessaries of life, the only market of labour really interfered with by this plan would be that of foreign countries, and the only persons who would be otherwise than sensibly benefitted would be the idle and profligate paupers. I had prepared myself more particularly for this part of the measure, but the time is gone. The ease with which it could be executed, the certainty of its success, the employment it would create, and the wages it would distribute, principally at the seasons of the year when labour is not supposed to be the most scarce, the advantage to the parishes of the country and to the public at large, these formed a large part perspectively of the subject which I have this night brought before the House; but upon these topics, for the reason I have stated, I must not enter. I shall now proceed to the means by which I propose to put this measure into execution; and this also I must, for the same too obvious reason, touch upon with very inconvenient brevity. The necessary machinery, then, for executing this plan I would take, in the first place, from the parochial officers already appointed by law the Churchwardens and Overseers of the poor, who are, as a body, a most useful and meritorious class; but I would not, however, resign the duty to them without control, as it might, and sometimes would, so happen in the country parishes, that they would have been parties to the mischiefs of which I have been speaking, and therefore not the most proper, or perhaps willing persons to remedy them. To them, therefore, I would add another important parochial functionary, to be created by law for this purpose, whose duty it would be to see, that the various provisions of the Act were truly and impartially carried into effect; conjointly with the present parochial officers, if that might be; but, if the latter should withstand the execution of the measure in the manner or spirit in which it is proposed to be carried into effect, then proceeding on his own authority, subject, however, to an appeal to the Quarter Sessions as to the propriety and fairness of his decision. This office would probably fall upon the resident, or, as he is sometimes called, the working clergyman, and, if so, from all I have witnessed or read in Committees or reports of this House, the better, generally  533 speaking, would it I think be for the poor. He was the individual contemplated in the Bill of the present Lord Chancellor when he proposed his benevolent measure touching education, to this House, which demanded local superintendence and management; but perhaps the appointment should not be thus fixed by law, but left to the parishioners, the poorest, however, in this case having their votes, or to the Magistrates of the division, as the farmers might overawe the poor in their choice; but this I leave to the wisdom of this House to determine. The office, by whomsoever undertaken, would be a thankless and unprofitable one, but its best and indeed high reward would be, the consciousness of largely administering to the public prosperity, as well as serving to an almost indescribable extent the deserving and industrious poor. Its conjoint duty would be, to select sites, and cause the erection of a certain number of cottages necessary for the decent accommodation of the labouring poor of the parish; to see that these and the cottages already in being had good and sufficient gardens attached to them, adjacent if possible, or at a convenient distance; if otherwise, to determine upon those labourers, according to the qualifications already stated, who shall have the advantage of keeping their cow, and to fix upon the conveniences for their so doing; to apportion, where such a measure would be found necessary, a plot of land as a work-field for the unemployed poor; and lastly, to ascertain that all these advantages were obtained at a current and reasonable rate as to rent. This officer I would denominate Guardian, or Protector of the Poor, investing him with powers to carry these propositions into effect, but imposing upon him no duty as to receiving or disbursing any of the sums required for realizing the measure. That this plan shall stand clear from a multitude of frivolous, or even from some real objections, is more than I anticipate. I defy, however, its opponents to advance any objections against the measure in the slightest degree comparable in magnitude to that of allowing things to remain as they are, to the utter destruction of the comforts and morals of the poor, and the imminent peril of the peace of society. I will only take up the further time of the House while I anticipate one of these, and it shall be that which I think will alone 534 be put forth, and worthy of a moment's consideration; it is that founded upon a rigid view of the rights of property. I will speedily dispose of this objection, so as to convert it into an argument in my favour, if there be any longer an honest intention to deal equally in matters of law and equity with the different ranks of society amongst us. In pleading for the restitution of the humble privileges of the poor as I have done, be it recollected that I have not asked for an indemnity for past spoliations, nor for any eleemosynary grants in lieu of them. I merely wish to put it to the House as a simple question of law and policy, whether the demand I make can be with the least colour of justice rejected. Sir, the rights of private property, ever since they have been recognized, have been made to give way to public necessity, or even convenience, not indeed by way of sacrifice, but for a reasonable compensation. Thus in the country the public road is projected, and when created, widened, shortened, or changed in its direction, or even a man's field broken into to obtain the necessary materials, whether in grass or tillage; the canal is dug, or the railway driven through an entire district, principally for the benefit of distant places and persons, so far interfering with the rights of property, and often inconveniently, in hundreds of parishes. In our cities whole streets are demolished, bridges erected, new approaches formed, nay, extensive alterations often carried into effect, whose sole apparent object is ornament and display; yet all of these demand, and on such terms as the law prescribes, the surrender of private property, and the often unwilling removal from their accustomed situations and established means of subsistence, of numbers of individuals. Now, I deny that while the object in any such instances, however proper in itself, is at all comparable in importance to the one at issue, however regarded, yet I maintain, that the liberty taken with property in any of these cases is infinitely greater than that which I propose; and yet that is never urged as a valid ground of objection against extensive and important improvements. Show me then an improvement in any one point of view at all comparable to that which promises to give happiness, peace, and prosperity to millions of the people; which would beautify instead of deforming the face of the country; which would increase  535 its value and multiply its resources; in a word, which should restore to the poor, and upon just and adequate terms, the privileges which they once gratuitously possessed, and without which it is impossible that they should subsist in comfort, or continue in peace, and which would effectuate all this by the slightest possible sacrifice by none whatever, indeed, when properly computed. Sir, I would fain hope that in this House the condition of the poor will still meet anxious consideration that here their wrongs will find redress. The suggestions of private benevolence, aided indeed by the soundest views of policy and interest, have long been urged in vain; their wrongs have gone on increasing, and will never be redressed except this House interfere. Let it do so then, and without delay. Let wealth allow that poverty which incessantly labours for its benefit, a comfortable abode wherein to rest. Let those who demand their summer toil, give them the means of employment and subsistence in the winter season; let the cry of them that reaped our fields come up before the Lord of the harvest, that Deity who is no respecter of persons, or, if he be, who is the respecter of the poor and needy. If feelings of justice and gratitude no longer sufficiently prevail, let those of just apprehension and of awakened fear be added. Recollect the mighty power with whom we have to deal. Like another Sampson we may deem it blind, and doomed to grind at the mill for our pleasure and convenience, but let the economists and politicians take care how they sport much longer with its awakened feelings, lest the spirit of vengeance and of strength return upon it, and it bow itself mightily against the pillars of your unrighteous system, and destroy the social structure, though itself perish in its ruins. But, Sir, I hope and believe that this House will listen to the suggestions of kindness and benevolence; that it will support a measure which demands the permanent sacrifice of none of the property of the country, but which, on the contrary, would greatly lighten the burthens it now sustains, and, above all, would give prosperity and peace to our rural poor. Let the House, then, assume its noblest character, that of the protector of the poor, and, seeing that the suggestions of humanity, and the dictates of policy have been long disregarded, let the 536 law once more interpose its sacred shield, and protect the defenceless and the wretched from the miseries which they have too long endured. With these observations, I beg leave to move to bring in a Bill, having for its object, to better the condition of the labouring poor."	-99.0	1831.0	1830
172832	172832	S3V0092P0-01175	1847-05-17	POOR LAW ADMINISTRATION BILL.	MR. FERRAND		"MR. FERRAND rose, pursuant to notice, to move that the Bill be read a second time that day six months. The hon. Member said: I have to thank the hon. and learned Gentleman (the Attorney General) for the manly and straightforward manner in which he replied to my question; but, however high an opinion I may have of the hon. and learned Gentleman's legal attainments, I believe I shall be able to bring before the House far higher legal authorities than his to bear out the positions I intend to take. I must say I was never more astonished in my life than to hear the right hon. Gentleman the Secretary of State for the Home Department say, that Mr. Mott was not dismissed from his office of assistant poor-law commissioner. Why, Sir, when the right hon. Gentleman the late Secretary of State for the Home Department was defending himself against certain statements which I made, he asserted that Mr. Mott was dismissed from his office, and that the hon. and learned Member for Bolton (Dr. Bowring) knew the reason why. I leave the two right hon. Gentlemen to settle the question between them. All I know is, that somebody has stated that which is not true. It is not for me to decide which of them it is. I may only say that I have no doubt the right hon. Gentleman (Sir G. Grey) fully believes the statement he has made to be true; and, therefore, I find no fault with him for making it. I now proceed to the question of the Poor Law; and here let me remind the House, that at the end of last Session of Parliament the right hon. Gentleman the Secretary of State for the Home Department gave a distinct pledge to the House and the country, that when Parliament should again meet, a Committee should be appointed for the purpose of inquiring into the whole proceedings and conduct of the Poor Law Commissioners. [Sir G. GREY: NO.] Most distinctly did the right hon. Gentleman make this statement to the House at the time when the Andover Union report was laid on the Table, and in reply to a question from me. [Sir G. GREY: The hon. Gentleman is mistaken.] 966 If the right hon. Gentleman denies that this is the case, of course I must believe him. I can only say that he was reported to have said so in all the public papers, and that remarks and comments were made upon it at the time. But in the present Session the noble Lord the First Lord of the Treasury, with that boldness of spirit for which he is conspicuous, has declared that he is prepared to justify the conduct of the Poor Law Commissioners, and is, I understand, to defend the New Poor Law itself. If that is the case, he has an opportunity of doing so to-night. I do trust that he will not shrink from the duty which he has undertaken to perform, and that he will do his best both to justify the conduct of the Poor Law Commissioners, and to prove that the New Poor Law has yielded all the advantages which its promoters promised should flow from it, and bear a blessing instead of a curse to the country. I suspect the noble Lord will find it a difficult task to establish either of those points, for I think I am myself prepared to prove to-night that this law has failed to perform what its promoters promised that, in fact, it has been a total failure, and that, so far from their having been able to carry it into effect, it has crumbled to pieces. The people of this country have long boasted that they were never called upon to obey any law except those passed by the three estates of the realm. But for thirteen years the poor and undefended masses of the country have been subject to the rule of three irresponsible men, who have had the power to make laws and enforce them where and as they thought proper, without being subject to any control either by Parliament or by Government. And after they have been acting in this manner for thirteen years, a Committee of this House having sat for four months inquiring into their conduct reported that towards the assistant commissioners they had acted with cruel injustice, and that their proceedings were unjust, arbitrary, and such as to shake public confidence in the law. If that was their conduct towards men who had friends in this House to defend them with talent and ability, how have they acted towards the poor and undefended in the secret corners of the land? To-night it is my intention to inform the House on. this point, and in doing so I hope to be able to induce the House to believe that it is high time to repeal this law, as well as to dismiss the Poor Law Commissioners. I shall first bring under the notice of the  967 House what were the intentions of the original concocters of this law; next, what have been the results of its operation; thirdly, I shall notice the remedy now proposed; I shall then show that Parliament has no power to pass such a law; and, lastly, that the poor have a sacred, legal, and inalienable right to relief. When the New Poor Law was first broached, it was supported by men who were determined to annihilate all Poor Laws in this country, to reduce the wages in the manufacturing districts, and to punish poverty as a crime. The noble Lord who first volunteered his services to bring this measure before Parliament was Lord Brougham; but before he did so he got a distinct pledge from the leaders of both political parties, that whoever should be in power no opposition should induce them to repeal the New Poor Law. And who was the person then consulted, and who guided the parties who drew up the Bill? It was a man whose name was odious throughout the country I mean Mr. Malthus; and Mr. Malthus, who was Lord Brougham's guide, as well as guide to the Commissioners who drew up the dark document to which I shall presently further allude, thus expresses himself as to the right of the poor to relief:  ""A man who is born in a world already possessed, if he cannot get subsistence from his parents, on whom he has a just demand, and if the society do not want his labour, has no claim of right to the smallest portion of food, and in fact has no business to be where he is. At nature's mighty feast there is no vacant cover for him. She tells him to be gone, and will quickly execute her own orders if he do not work upon the compassion of some of her guests."" He also says  ""I have reflected much on the subject of the Poor Laws, and hope, therefore, that I shall be excused in venturing to suggest a mode of their gradual abolition, to which I confess that at present I can see no material objection. As a previous step even to any considerable alteration in the present system, which would contract or stop the increase of the relief to be given, it appears to me that we are bound, in justice and honour, formally to disclaim the right of the poor to support."" Now hear what Lord Brougham said of his friend Mr. Malthus when he in another place moved the second reading of the New Poor Law, and which speech he afterwards published I know not whether at the expense of Government, but at somebody's expense and circulated it throughout the country:  ""Before quitting the subject of population, may I step aside for one moment, and do justice to a most learned, a most able, a most virtuous indi- 968 vidual, whose name has been mixed up with more unwitting deception, and also with more wilful misrepresentation, than that of any man of science in this Protestant country, and in these enlightened and liberal times? When I mention talent, learning, humanity, the strongest sense of public duty, the most amiable feelings in private life, the tenderest and most humane disposition which ever man was adorned with when I speak of one, the ornament of the society in which he moves, the delight of his own family, and not less the admiration of those men of letters and of science amongst whem he shines the first and brightest when I speak of one of the most enlightened, learned, and pious ministers whom the Church of England ever numbered amongst her sons, I am sure every one will apprehend that I cannot but refer to Mr. Malthus."" That was the way in which Lord Brougham had in another place alluded to Mr. Malthus, after having quoted him largely in defence of his opinion on the New Poor Law. Well, a Commission was appointed to inquire into the operation of the 43rd of Elizabeth throughout the country; and assistant commissioners were sent into various parts of England for the purpose of obtaining evidence. Of course, the evidence so obtained was all of the strongest kind against the old Poor Law. The Commissioners knew the wishes and intentions of Government, and acted like good and obedient servants; and upon the information derived from those Commissioners, and from the writings of Mr. Malthus, the Commissioners appointed in London to receive the evidence and report upon it to Government, drew up what has been called ""the dark document"" a document which, although the First Lord of the Treasury may smile at what I say I hesitate not to describe as so disgraceful, so scandalous, nay, so wicked in its suggestions, that the Government of the day in this House, and the Duke of Wellington in another place, thought it of sufficient consequence to deny its existence: and it was not until an hon. Friend of mine (Mr. Walter), who now lies, I regret to say, on a bed of sickness, but whose services will he remembered after the baronetcy of Hogg has ceased to exist I say it was not until my hon. Friend produced that document in this House that the then Secretary of State for the Home Department (Sir J. Graham), who had previously denied its existence, said that he had some faint recollection of it. It is my duty to bring under the notice of the House what was suggested in that dark document. The first recommendation was  ""The Commissioners shall have power to reduce allowances, but not to enlarge them."" After  969 some further suggestions: ""After this has been accomplished, orders may be sent forth, directing that, after such a date, all out-door relief should be given partly in kind; after such another period, it should be wholly in kind; after such another period, it should be gradually diminished in quantity until that mode of relief was exhausted. From the first relief should be altered in quality, coarse brown bread being substituted for white; and, concurrently with these measures as to the out-door poor, a gradual reduction should be made in the diet of the in-door poor, and strict regulations enforced."" I am shocked to say that this document had the signatures of two bishops, viz., the Bishop of London and the Bishop of Chester, as well as other persons high in authority. At last Lord Althorp introduced into this House the New Poor Law Bill, and he gave a distinct pledge to the House that some of the most cruel provisions which have since been enforced should never be enforced; that, in fact, they did not exist. Upon that occasion no fewer than 5,519,596 people petitioned against the Bill; but in spite of these petitions the Bill was carried. When the Bill was before the other House, Lord Brougham stated that the ultimate object was to abolish all Poor Laws; and Lord Fitzwilliam said he should vote for it with the conviction that it would lead to no Poor Law at all. I have now given to this House proofs that it was the intention of the original promoters of the Bill to abolish all Poor Laws; and, having done so, it is now my duty to bring before the notice of the House as disgraceful a scheme as was ever entered into by employers to rob the employed of their wages; I allude to a correspondence which took place between certain cotton spinners in Lancashire and Mr. Chadwick, one of the parties who was employed to prepare the Bill, and which correspondence took place in 1834 and 1835. But, lest the Government should attempt to explain away the correspondence, and say that the Poor Law Commissioners regretted after it had taken place the sale and transportation of large masses of the agricultural population who were sent down to the manufacturing districts, I think it my duty, before quoting the letters of Messrs. Ashworth and Greg, to read to the House an extract from a report by the Poor Law Commissioners themselves:  ""The Commissioners think it necessary to observe, that in case of a strike of workmen for higher wages than their employers are willing to give, a question arises whether the guardians would be justified in refusing or discontinuing relief when the men might obtain employment, if they chose to accept it, at wages sufficient to fur- 970 nish the means of subsistence for themselves and their families. If, therefore, the guardians are in a situation to say that the men now applying for or receiving relief may obtain work within their reach at wages sufficient for their maintenance and that of their families, and it only depends upon themselves to accept it, they are justified in refusing relief to those persons, simply because they can no longer be considered destitute?"" That was the opinion of the Poor Law Commissioners, and Messrs. Ashworth and Greg wrote to them and suggested what I am about to read to the House:  ""The suggestion which I wish particularly to make is, that in the New (Poor Law Amendment) Bill, the greatest possible facility should be afforded to families of this description (agricultural labourers), who should be willing or desirous of removing from the agricultural counties, where work is scarce, to the manufacturing districts, where it is abundant. I am most anxious that every facility be given to the removal of labourers from one county to another according to the demand for labour; this would have a tendency to equalize wages, as well as prevent, in a degree, some of the turn-outs which have been of late so prevalent."" As soon as the New Poor Law was enacted, the Commissioners employed persons as assistant poor law commissioners, whom they sent into different agricultural districts for the purpose of inducing agricultural labourers to leave their homes under the most solemn pledges that they should have the highest wages which could be given in the manufacturing districts; and for the purpose of more easily inducing the poor ignorant men, women, and children, to believe the tales which they told them, they placarded the whole agricultural districts from which the people were removed with lists of wages which it was never intended they should receive, and which they never did receive. But one of the blackest stains on the New Poor Law is this that Dr. Kaye was employed as an assistant poor-law commissioner in Suffolk and Norfolk for the purpose of inducing the agricultural labourers to go to Manchester and the manufacturing districts that very Dr. Kayo having, within three years of that period, published a pamphlet, entitled ""The Moral and Physical Condition of the Working Classes employed in the Manufactures of Manchester,"" in which he states what I will read to the House. Recollect, within three years after this Dr. Kaye had written his description of the working population of Manchester, he was employed in sending to that very town, to be absorbed in that population, the poor agricultural labourers of the south, who had been brought up in the green fields and  971 shady lanes, about which I was taunted with ""babbling"" by the late First Lord of the Treasury sending them ticketted and labelled, like beasts for slaughter. I see that an hon. and learned Friend smiles at the idea of the poor people being ticketed like beasts for slaughter, and therefore I feel it to be my duty to tell him that they were so ticketed; the tickets were tied to them, and they were embarked in boats, and sent hundreds of miles from home without a person to guide and direct them whither to go, and they were turned adrift in the streets of Manchester at dead of night. The police reports of that town frequently afterwards gave harrowing accounts of the sufferings of these poor agricultural labourers. The House shall now hear the description which Dr. Kaye had given of the working population of Manchester three years previous to the period to which I am referring. ""Interested in the fatal secret of subsisting on what is barely necessary to life, the labouring classes (of Manchester) have ceased to entertain a laudable pride in furnishing their houses, and in multiplying the decent comforts which minister to happiness. He neglects the comforts and delicacies of life. He lives in squalid wretchedness, on meagre food, and expends his superfluous gains in debauchery. Domestic economy is neglected, domestic comforts are unknown. A meal of the coarsest food is prepared with heedless haste, and devoured with equal precipitation. His house is ill furnished, uncleanly, often ill ventilated, perhaps damp. His food, from want of forethought and domestic economy, is meagre and unnutritious. He is debilitated and hypochondriacal, and falls the victim of dissipation."" That was Dr. Kaye's account of Manchester, published three years, before he was employed as a Poor Law Commissioner, in sending thousands of ignorant labourers to that very district to be ""absorbed,"" as the master manufacturers in their correspondence with the Poor Law Commissioners termed it, in the manufacturing population there, and by that means to cause a reduction in the amount of wages which they were in the habit of paying to their workpeople. Tens of thousands of poor labourers were despatched from the agricultural districts to Manchester, and there I will leave them for the present. It will now be my duty to refer to the cruelty inflicted on the agricultural poor of the south of England, where the Poor Law Commissioners endeavoured to enforce a law which set at defiance the laws of both God and man. In the first instance the law was put in force at the point of the bayonet. Not content 972 with calling on the military for aid, you despatched the metropolitan police to various parts of the country, and armed with cutlasses they assisted in enforcing the law. You attempted uniformity of practice wherever you could. You produced an in-door labour test, and you refused outdoor relief. You sold up thousands and tens of thousands of the poor of England. When the poor went to the boards of guardians and asked for that to which they had a right as sacred as the Monarch has to her Crown, the Peer to his palace, or any Member of this House to the coat which he wears upon his back, what cruelty did you not inflict upon them? You erected immense buildings, which are justly termed ""bastilles,"" the windows of which are placed at such a height from the floors that it is impossible for the inmates to look through them. You immured them in cells, and did not allow them to leave their prisons even to go to a place of public worship on Sunday. Their diet table was worse than that of felons by far; it was drawn up by Mr. Mott, a person who had made a large fortune by farming the poor of several workhouses in London. You compelled them to wear a felon's dress; but not content with that, you branded the dress with the name of the workhouse in which the poor were confined, on the back, on the breast, on the knees, and on the caps. Whenever they left the workhouses they went in those dresses in order that the finger of scorn might be pointed at them; but, instead of that, the spectacle only roused feelings of indignation in the breasts of the English people. You broke up households and you scattered families; you separated husband from wife, and you took children you stole them from their parents, and sent them thirty or forty miles in another direction; and when they happened to die, the parents were not informed of the loss which they had sustained. Harrowing details have occasionally been given to the public by the press of the agony which the poor have suffered on unexpectedly learning that some dear relative had expired in a union workhouse, perhaps years before. Ay, and after treating the unhappy poor in this manner, you have cleared the union workhouses of them and sold them to taskmasters. I have brought several cases of the kind before the House; and I now hold in my hand a application made by a manufacturer to an union workhouse for men, women, and children. It is most revolting to the feel-  973 ings of human nature that our poor and unprotected fellow-subjects in this country should he sold like beasts, used up and worked to death in factories. The letter to which I refer is from Messrs. W. J. Walmsley and Brothers, of Marples, near Stockport for I will give authority for all I state and is dated the 3rd of March, 1846. The letter which is addressed to the master of the union workhouse at Llanfyllin, Montgomeryshire, is couched in the following terms:  ""It is probable there may be in your union, as we hare found there are in others, parties chargeable and not chargeable, who might better themselves by removal to the manufacturing districts. We can find employment in our cotton mill here for ten or twenty females from thirteen to eighteen, and a few boys turned thirteen years of age. The average weekly wages of females is from 7s. to 13s., and boys from 5s. to 9s. 6d.; but when the boys become spinners they may earn from 32s. to 38s. per week, or even more, the work being paid for by the piece. If you can recommend any such parties, we should be glad if you would favour us with a line, stating their names and ages by return, when one of our firm will come over. We shall take charge of any children coming without parents."" The House will observe, that it was arranged that ""one of the firm"" should go over to the workhouse in order to examine the unfortunate inmates, and ascertain whether they were sound in wind and limb; and if they proved so they were then to be handed over to their taskmasters. These things are done under the sanction of the Poor Law Commissioners; year after year such transactions have taken place, and you, the Government, know it and have suffered it. Who, I ask, are the persons whom you have appointed as masters of union workhouses to tyrannize over and persecute the poor? Whenever you can obtain a man who has been in the Army a discharged soldier if you can only get an ex-sergeant of dragoons, artillery, or engineers, he is sure to be preferred by the Poor Law Commissioners. Those are the men who have been appointed to oppress, to persecute, ay, and to murder, the poor. I use that word advisedly; for since the law has been in force, many juries have unanimously declared, that persons confined in the union workhouses have died from ill treatment and want of food. Now, in the next place, I ask you, how have you proceeded to carry your law into force out of the union workhouses? The unions are themselves so large, that the poor find it almost impossible to travel to the boards of guardians. Ten, twenty, and thirty 974 miles have the poor to travel for a pittance of sixpence or a shilling, and in some instances they spend three days in going and returning. I hold in my hand a letter written by a clergyman in Yorkshire, giving a description of the hardship and inconvenience to which the poor are subjected in consequence of the large size of the unions in that county, and mentioning the case of a poor man who was obliged to travel twenty-four miles to seek relief from the board of guardians of the Skipton Union. I once saw a man who had travelled twenty-four miles to plead his cause before a board of guardians; he was between seventy and eighty years of age, and the guardians dismissed him with 6d. What has been your medical treatment of the poor? You remember the evidence given before the Committee appointed to inquire into the medical treatment of the poor, of which Lord Ashley was chairman. Some of the most eminent medical men in London were examined before that Committee, and they proved that the Poor Law Commissioners would sanction no higher scale of payment to medical officers than 3d. or 4d. per case. The consequence has been, that the poor have died for want of proper medical treatment. I have now given a sketch of the way in which it has been attempted to enforce the blood-stained law; for recollect that, at Bradford, the military cut down the people when an attempt was made to put the law in operation. I say, therefore, that blood has been shed in the attempt to enforce a law which you yourselves now declare to be an utter failure. Before I proceed to show what has been the effect of the New Poor Law upon the people, I think it my duty to read to the House the solemn pledges which were given by Lord Brougham at the time when he pleaded for the second reading of the Bill. His Lordship addressed the following language to the House of Peers:  ""I say, my Lords, you not only may but you must listen to these recommendations, when you have the best judges in matters of opinion, and the best witnesses to the matter of fact, all in one voice representing to you a state of things which has made industry and idleness, honesty and knavery, change places; and which exposes the property of the community and with its property, every law, every institution, every valuable possession, every precious right to the ravages of that remorseless pestilence before whose strides you, the guardians of the social happiness of those who live under your protection, have beheld the peasantry of England abased to a depth which I am at once afflicted and ashamed to contemplate, which I shudder to describe, and which I could not bear to think of, did I not know that the  975 same hand which lays it bare to your eyes, and makes its naked deformity horrible in your sight, will be enabled, by your assistance, to apply to the foul disease a safe and effectual remedy restoring to industry its due reward, and visiting idleness with its appropriate punishment reinstating property in security, and lifting up once more, God be praised! the character of that noble English peasantry to the proud eminence where, but for the Poor Laws, it would still have shone untarnished the admiration of mankind and the glory of the country which boasts it as its brightest ornament!"" I will presently show how the New Poor Law has elevated the character of the working men, how it has restored prosperity to them, and how it has destroyed idleness and vice. If the pledges given by Lord Brougham upon that occasion have not been fulfilled, then I say that for thirteen years you have in vain oppressed, persecuted, and plundered the poor, and that the new law has been a greater failure than it can be pretended the 43rd of Elizabeth ever was. If you, the Government, are prepared to take on yourselves the responsibility which attaches to the Poor Law Commissioners if you are prepared to do that, you are braver men than I gave you credit for being; and I think that before I have done, I shall be able to satisfy the House that, as the Poor Law Commissioners have failed, so will the four Cabinet Ministers fail to administer the law in a manner to satisfy the country. Before I proceed further, however, let me refer to the sufferings of the poor ""emigrants,"" as they are called, who were taken from the agricultural districts and carried to Manchester and Yorkshire in 1835, 1836, and 1837. They were promised in the most sacred manner that they should have good wages, plenty of food, and comfortable homes; but what was their condition in 1840 and 1841? Why, I heard from the lips of the then and present Member for Manchester, that the poor workpeople of that town were then in such a frightful state of distress that they were living on 1d. a day, and that some even had no food whatever; that they were digging up the carcases of horses which had been buried, and devouring the flesh. The hon. Member for Bolton also told tales of the distress in that town, which so shocked the feelings of the House that the Poor Law Commissioners attempted to deny them on the authority of a report drawn up Mr. Mott. That report, however, turned out to be so false that the Poor Law Commissioners, acting under the authority of the then Secretary 976 of State for the Home Department, were obliged to dismiss Mr. Mott for having drawn it up. I thought it my duty to move for a return of the poor agricultural labourers who had been sent into the north of England under the solemn pledges that they should be sent back to their homes whenever they expressed a wish to return. What was the return made to my Motion? The poor-law authorities were unable to account for a single soul of those whom they had kidnapped and sold into the manufacturing districts. Let us now see what has been the effect on the comforts, morals, and habits of the people of this law, which Lord Brougham pledged himself should raise them in the social condition and restore them to comfort and respectability. On this point I shall quote from a Cabinet Minister, a Member of the present Government and a staunch supporter of the new Poor Law. I allude to Earl Grey, then Lord Howick, who, in March, 1846, spoke in these terms of the condition of the working people of Sunderland:  ""The borough of Sunderland consisted of three parishes, Sunderland, Bishopwearmouth, and Monkwearmouth. The first of these parishes was chiefly inhabited by the working classes, and the rates on the last six months had been 18s. in the pound...It was frightful to contemplate this state of things. In 1837, the amount expended in relief was only 7,035l.; in 1842 it amounted to 14,232l. In addition, a sum of 2,192l., and also from 800 to 1,000 tons of coals, were subscribed and appropriated to the relief of the poor. In illustration of the actual state of the country he would refer to a return of casual poor relieved at Alnwick in different years, from which it appeared that, not to go further back than the year 1841, itself a year of great pressure, there were relieved 1,826 casual poor; in the year just closed there were relieved 3,653 casual poor. Having then taken one great town and one agricultural district, he thought, from what he had stated of them, that he was justified in concluding, that the distress which the expression used in Her Majesty's Speech would lead one to conclude was confined to the manufacturing districts, was, in reality, a wide-spread distress.... When such a falling-off in the revenue took place, caused, as it could only be, by the forced economy that was the offspring of distress, they might judge what the amount of that distress must be. In every class of life forced economy was painful... What must it be to the working man when he was compelled to surrender his few luxuries one after another to give up his tobacco, his sugar, and his tea or coffee when he was no longer able even to afford his family bread, for at length bread became a luxury which he could no longer afford, and a coarser kind must be substituted? But, above all, what must it be to him to watch his wife and children gradually falling into rags, and pining in wretchedness and despair? But worst of all were the corroding anxieties that beset him as he saw week  977 after week and day after day passing on, and things getting worse and worse, whilst starvation appeared to be staring him in the face! It was such a state as this that many among the working classes had to endure, who, a little time ago, were well paid, well fed, and well clad. It was the case of many of those, who, but a little time ago, earned more than enough to support themselves and their families."" I must also read to the House a statement made by Lord Brougham in 1843:  ""He entirely concurred in the respect and admiration expressed by his noble Friend the President of the Board of Trade, as well as his noble Friend opposite (Earl Stanhope), of the peaceful and patient conduct of the working classes under the grievous infliction they had lately endured; but he could see no way, unhappily if he did, his misery would be less if he or any one else could see a way out of those difficulties which would restore the working classes to their former state of comfort."" Why, we were told that this new Poor Law would work the regeneration of the people of this country; yet, here is the author of that measure, after it had been nine years in operation, admitting that he can see no way of relieving the poor from their distress. Sir, to show the regular operation of the law, I will now read an extract from The Times of the 18th of February, 1843:  ""The distress at Stourbridge is stated to have become so alarming that numbers are subsisting on turnips alone. From a field belonging to Mr. Thomas Parginter, as many as from five to six tons a week have been taken for several weeks past; nor does he think it expedient to attempt to put a stop to the peculation."" Worcester Journal. Here was a case where the poor were in such a starving state that they stole at the rate of five or six tons of turnips per week, and the owner was so struck with their sufferings that he never thought fit to stop them. That is one instance of the state of the poor under this law in the year 1843. I will also refer to the proceedings at the Brentford petty sessions in the same year, where several magistrates were present, and where two men were brought before them in their prison dress, and branded in the manner I have already described. All the magistrates present spoke in indignation of the manner in which the poor were treated by the Poor Law Commissioners; and one of them, Mr. Armstrong, observed that, ""it seemed as if the country were returning to a state of feudal tyranny. He was glad to see that the Bench were unanimous in deprecating such proceedings."" I hold also in my hand extracts from the different county newspapers in 1842 and 1843, giving ac- 978 counts of the manner in which numbers of poor men had been sent to gaols in different parts of the country, for only disobeying the orders of the Poor Law Commissioners. I will not weary the House by reading them all; they are from the county papers of Sussex, Hampshire, Essex, Kent, and Surrey. Yet at the very time these things were occurring, the late Government always maintained that the law worked well. They were always ready to screen the Poor Law Commissioners against public inquiry and indignation; and the present Government, when in opposition, were always ready to support them. Whenever the Commissioners appeared to be hard pressed, the noble Lord now at the head of the Government always with great chivalry rose and defended them; and when the right hon. Baronet the late Secretary for the Home Department (Sir J. Graham), was beginning to be rather squeezable on the subject when he seemed disposed to make some alterations in the working of the law for the purpose of conciliating public opinion, the noble Lord (Lord J. Russell) was always ready to get up and protest against any relaxation, and to call for uniformity of practice. And the noble Lord was always sure to be cheered by his Whig friends when he did so. Why, I myself, Sir, have seen the bodies of persons who were starved to death under this law. I have attended inquests where juries have wished to return verdicts of wilful murder against the relieving officer, and the coroner approved of their doing so; but the relieving officer has drawn out of his pocket instructions of the Poor Law Commissioners, and snapped his fingers at the coroner, who, on perusing those instructions, told the jury he had been justified in acting as he had done. Well, Sir, I come to the year 1844, when the Poor Law Commissioners came and asked for further powers, more tyrannical and illegal than those which they had enjoyed before. You passed a law appointing auditors. What was their conduct? Every post brings me letters detailing the arbitrary conduct of these auditors; and I cannot do better than mention to the House one case, where a correspondence has passed between the Commissioners and the guardians of the Dudley Union, the auditors having commenced an action against the guardians for having treated the poor to beef and pudding at Christmas. I have moved for returns relating to the proceedings of these auditors, and I think the House will agree with me  979 that such proceedings as this I have referred to are disgraceful. Yet the law which allows them is upheld. I now come to the year 1845. In that year the hon. Member for Finsbury came down to the House and made the appalling statement, that the poor in the Andover Union were so starved that they were living on carrion, and were fighting for the putrid hones they were employed to grind. And now, in 1847, where are the Poor Law Commissioners? where are the men who have been guilty of these acts? You say that they are to be dismissed from their offices, but you are still prepared to defend them and to justify their conduct. Why are you so prepared to defend them? Do you think them innocent? Can you deny one statement I have made against them? Can you suppose that the public indignation would have been roused against them from one end of the country to the other, unless they were guilty of the offences laid to their charge? But it seems that not only are you going to get rid of your Commissioners, but also of your uniformity of practice. The right hon. Baronet the Secretary for the Home Department has told us the operation of the Bill must vary with the different circumstances of different parts of the country. But do you expect the feelings of the masses in the country to vary with the varying circumstances of the law, the operation of which you thus propose to alter? Do you expect that in one part of the country there shall be no natural affection between parent and offspring, or between husband and wife? Are you to have one law in the south, where you expect the people will submit, and another in the north, where perhaps you are afraid that the people will rise and resist your tyranny your attempts to separate husband and wife, and to tear parents and their children from each other? Why not define the law at once, and let the people know what you mean? Let us know exactly what is to be the difference between the old law and the new one? Let the poor know at once what cruelties are to be practised on them by authority of this House, in place of those heretofore adopted by an irresponsible body of men. Sir, I have read the ""defence"" of these Commissioners, filled with extracts from the evidence before the Andover Union Committee. It is not a defence it is an ex-parte statement; but what, after all, is their boast? Why, that they have saved 1,000,000l. a year. But how many of 980 the poor have been robbed in order to save that 1,000,000l. a year? How many have been robbed of their just legal rights in order to enable the Commissioners to make that boast? They may have saved the rates in the south, where incendiarism still blazes in the rickyards; or in the agricultural districts, where they sold the people to the manufacturers to bring down wages; or where they have driven them into gaols to escape from their persecution. But they have not saved them in the north of England, as this petition will show:  ""Wakefield Union. The following is the copy of the Petition sent to the Poor Law Commissioners from the Guardians of this Union:  ""To the Poor Law Commissioners, Somerset House, London. ""In pursuance of a resolution passed unanimously (one member excepted) at the Wakefield board of guardians, on Wednesday, the 22nd inst., 'That the working of the New Poor Law, in the Wakefield Union, is fraught with great evil, and that it is desirable the said union should be dissolved.' ""We, therefore, whose names are hereunder subscribed, being guardians of the Wakefield Union, beg leave most respectfully to call the attention of the Poor Law Commissioners to the alarming increase in the amount of poor rates collected in the several townships within the said union, for the three years ending last March, as compared with the three years previous to the commencement of the union, to wit, a total increase of rate of 10,306l. ""Fully convinced, from the above circumstances, not only that the New Poor Law in this neighbourhood is a perfect failure, but also that the ratepayers are fast verging to pauperism, without adding one extra comfort to the poor, we cannot do otherwise than listen to the imperative dictates of our own consciences, and pray most earnestly that the Poor Law Commissioners will be pleased to dissolve this union, and allow each township to have the management of its own poor."" Wakefield Journal, Aug. 25, 1843. I have also accounts of the expenditure in different districts of my part of the country, all which show that it is still increasing. Now what is the price you have had to pay for the enforcement of this unconstitutional law for fourteen years? You have had a rebellion in Wales; an outbreak in the north of England; incendiarism still rife in the south; a frightful and increasing system of child murder; coroners' juries charging the Poor Law Commissioners with destroying the poor; increase of rural police; 10,000 armed pensioners called out; gaols enlarged and new ones erected; sessions every six weeks instead of every twelve weeks; winter assizes; the statement of Judge Coleridge, that crime is rapidly increasing all over the country; central barracks erected at  981 Birmingham; a discontented people; peace only maintained by the military; and poverty and distress greater than ever before known in England. These are a few items of the price you have paid for the enforcement of your law. And how long do you suppose the country will submit to this state of things? You may suppose that you are going, to use a common phrase, to let the Poor Law and the Commissioners down easily; but do you suppose that the people of this country are not awake enough to make this a great question at the next general election? It is true that the Whigs have stood firm to their declarations at the last election. But what was the conduct of the late Government and their supporters? How was the election for Cambridge carried? The New Poor Law was the rallying cry. It is disgraceful and degrading that persons should have wrought up to the highest pitch of indignation the feelings of electors and non-electors, only that they might come here and betray them. I could name a borough where the two candidates took it by turns to do the pathetic on the New-Poor Law. One of them was returned to this House, and he certainly has given a little opposition to the Poor Law; but the other has since got a seat for another place, and he has actually voted for the very measure which I myself had heard him denounce as blasphemous. Having now stated these faults of the system, I leave them, with a challenge to you to deny them if you can. If you cannot deny them, then you admit the system to be a complete failure. It has not only been that, but also a bitter curse to the country. And now what is your remedy? Why, you propose to re-establish the same cruel and unconstitutional system under another form. You give all the powers of the Commission to four Cabinet Ministers empowered to maintain the law against all opposition. Is the right hon. Baronet going to sanction the same system of tyranny that was carried on under the Commissioners? Is he going to tear parent from child husband from wife? Is he going still to transport the natives of the agricultural districts to the manufacturing districts? What right would he have to do so? The poor man's right to relief is as sacred as the right hon. Baronet's to any property he possesses. Is he prepared to have the provisions of this law tried on those who are near and dear to himself? If not, what right has he to inflict on the 982 poor man that which he would not bear himself? I can tell him that the poor man loves his wife as well as he loves his; and degraded must that Cabinet Minister be who would enforce the law against the poor man, for no other reason than that he is poor and is unable to procure protection. By Clause 20, it appears, Her Majesty may, if she pleases, by the advice of Her Privy Council, disavow the acts of the Board; but as those who would have to advise her would constitute the Board, it is not likely they would give her such advice. I have now given a brief sketch of the powers which the Government propose to take under this Bill; and from this tyranny to what tribunal are the poor to appeal? To the Government? Why, they will be their oppressors. To this House? Why, the Government of the day must have a majority behind its back in this House. To whom, then, are the poor to appeal against the tyranny and oppression of four Cabinet Ministers? You will say they may petition the Sovereign. But their petition must pass through the hands of the Home Secretary, whose conduct they are complaining of. I do not say the right hon. Gentleman opposite me would do it, but we know that the last Home Secretary kept back a memorial addressed to Her Majesty. I will tell you what the poor man may appeal to he may appeal to the common law of England and to the British constitution. And although the hon. and learned Gentleman the Attorney General has given ready answers to the questions I have put, and which elicited frequent cries of ""Hear, hear,"" from the noble Lord at the head of the Government, it will be my duty to prove to the House that this House of Commons, and that the Parliament of this country, have no power to pass this Bill, and that if it does pass, it is null and void. I ask the attention of the hon. and learned Gentleman (the Attorney General) while I give him my authorities, and I think he will admit that they are equal to his own. I will prove from the most eminent authorities that Parliament has no power to delegate the power of making laws. Locke says  ""The Legislature is empowered only to make laws, and not to make legislators."" Justice Blackstone says  ""Whenever the legislative and executive powers are found together, there is an end of public liberty."" You have both legislative and executive powers in the hands of the Poor Law Com-  983 missioners, and, according to Blackstone, there is therefore an end of public liberty. Lord Coke from the judgment seat declared  ""It appears in our books, that in many cases the common law will control Acts of Parliament, and sometimes adjudge them to be utterly void; for when an Act of Parliament is against common right and reason, or repugnant and impossible to be performed, the common law will control it, and adjudge it void."" It is clear that the New Poor Law is ""against common right and reason."" Magna Charta, the charter of our rights, asserts  ""We will not, by ourselves or others, procure anything whereby any of these concessions or liberties be revoked or lessened, and if any such thing be obtained, let it be null and void."" Lord Eldon declared, a short time before he died, to a friend of mine  ""It is an unconstitutional Bill, but it is sure to pass; for now-a-days they will pass anything. There is no authority to empower the Legislature to pass such a Bill, nor, when passed, any constitutional power to enforce it. If matters have indeed come to this, a national convention should be called."" Lord Eldon also said, when addressing a noble Friend  ""It is the most infamous law that ever was enacted in a Christian country. If the Parliament will not do its duty, the people must do theirs. Nothing can be done till the country is ready for it, which it soon will be."" I hold in my hand a statement made by Lord Wynford, late Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, upon the second reading of the New Poor Law Bill in another place. Lord Wynford said  ""Never was there an instance in either ancient or modern times when such a power as this was given to any set of men. Blackstone himself contemplated with horror the power that was given to the King under the Mutiny Act. He thought it was unconstitutional that His Majesty should have the power of making laws, deciding upon laws, and rescinding laws; and yet the power which Blackstone thought unfit to be placed in the hands even of the King, was to be given to these Commissioners. They were even to have the power of delegating that power; and the only restraint by which they, or those delegated by them, would be subject, would be in making general regulations. Their general regulations would have to be submitted to the Secretary of State; but no control whatever was intended to be exercised over their other proceedings. He did not think that even the noble and learned Lord himself could defend delegating such enormous powers as these; but even if he should, then he must say that he was certainly too jealous about granting arbitrary power ever to permit it, except in a case of absolute necessity; but no such necessity has yet been made out. He had shown that it would not only affect property generally, but that it would enable the Commissioners to determine 984 whether the unfortunate pauper should eat his miserable pittance in a state of liberty or of thraldom. Whilst in the workhouse, they could treat the pauper just as they pleased, and in them was to be vested the power to say, 'You shall have relief or you shall not.' He could not help saying that it was utterly impossible for him to contemplate those powers without alarm. They had abolished negro slavery: but if this Bill passed, he very much feared that a short time only would elapse until they saw the condition of the poor of this country infinitely worse than that of the serfs of the Continent, or the villains of former ages; worse even than that of the West Indies, to whom they had given their freedom."" That was the opinion of Lord Chief Justice Wynford. Lord Abinger, another Judge, and a high authority in this country, gave a similar opinion in the other House. Are these authorities not sufficient? The poor have been reduced to an abject state of misery and want; they can only obtain food on condition of being branded with a felon's dress. Why, Sir, the working population of this country to a man believe that no Parliament has the right to pass such a law as this; and they are backed by the high authorities I have read, and which will have great weight with the people of this country. I will venture to say that if a poor man, who had been imprisoned under the unconstitutional powers of this Bill, were to carry his case before the twelve Judges, they would declare, notwithstanding your Act of Parliament, that the man had been illegally imprisoned. Having given these high authorities, let the House listen to the opinions of a working man on this question, and then they will see that the working people of this country are thinking deeply upon the treatment they are receiving from the Government and from the Parliament of this country. I have received this letter within the last few days from a working man:  ""To leave Her Majesty's poor subjects in the hands of an irresponsible power, is but cruel mockery. It has been the boast of Great Britain that the home of the poor man was his castle that it is held as sacred as the palace; such were the views of Lord Chatham in his day. He said, By the British constitution every man's house is his castle; it may be a straw-built shed; every wind of heaven may whistle round it all the elements may enter it but the King cannot, the King dare not.' And since his time it was the boast of His Royal Highness the Duke of Kent (our present Sovereign's father) that 'it is the glory of the British constitution that it protects the poor as well as the rich the peasant as well as the prince; whoever has the temerity to injure either the person, property, or character of the meanest of His Majesty's subjects, must be prepared to grapple with the strength of the empire.""  985 I tell Her Majesty's Government, that if they mean to bolster up the present Poor Law under another name, they too ""must be prepared to grapple with the strength of the empire."" The Poor Law deprived hon. Gentlemen opposite of office at the last election, and it will deprive them of office at the next general election. For, although they may try to blink this question, I tell them every man in the country is denouncing the conduct of the Poor Law Commissioners, and declaring that your New Poor Law is an utter and disgraceful failure. I have now shown to this House that you have no power to pass this Bill, and that if you pass it, it will be null and void. I will now show the House that the poor have a right to relief; and if they have a right to relief, I ask the Government, who will have to enforce this law, by what right they will refuse relief except upon the condition of these parties degrading themselves? Why, Sir, until you passed this New Poor Law, the poor were ready to shed their blood to defend their country. They are now compelled to sacrifice their liberty to save their lives. To prove that the poor have a right to relief, I will quote John Locke, who says  ""A man can no more make use of another's necessity to force him to become his vassal, by withholding that relief which God requires him to afford to the wants of his brother, than he that has more strength can seize upon a weaker, and with a dagger at his throat, offer him death or slavery. As justice gives every man a title to the product of his honest industry and the fair acquisition of his ancestors descended to him; so charity gives every man a title to so much of another's plenty as will keep him from extreme want, when he has no means to subsist otherwise."" You do ""force"" the poor man to ""become ""your vassal"" when you refuse to admit him into a poor-law union except upon degrading conditions. Archdeacon Paley says   ""When the partition of property is rigidly maintained against the claims of indigence and distress, it is maintained in opposition to the intention of those who made it, and to His who is the supreme proprietor of every thing, and who has filled the world with plenteousness for the sustenance and comfort of all whom he sends into it."" I might quote Puffendorf, Grotius, and Coke, who all agree on this point; but hear what Blackstone asserts:  ""The law not only regards life and member and protects every man in the enjoyment of them, but also furnishes him with everything necessary for their support. For there is no man so indigent or wretched but he may demand a supply sufficient for all the necessaries of life from the 986 more opulent of the community, by means of the several statutes enacted for the relief of the poor a humane provision, dictated by the principles of society."" Judge Hale said, from the bench  ""The laws of this kingdom made sufficient provision for the supply of persons in necessity, by collections for the poor, and by the powers of the civil magistrates; and the Act of Elizabeth has reduced charity to a system, and interwoven it with our very constitution."" These are high authorities, both in the House and out of it, and they prove that the poor have a right to relief. I will finish my authorities by an extract from Lord Brougham, who himself admitted, in the other House, that the poor have a right to relief. On the second reading of the New Poor Law, Lord Brougham said  ""I grant that this was the original distribution of the tithe (one-third going to the fabric of the church, one-third to the parson, and one-third to the poor); and I also admit, that in much later times, as far down as the 15th of Richard II., this right of the poor was recognised by Parliament; for in that year an Act passed which in terms admitted the right of the poor to sustentation out of this fund. I admit, too, that still later, in the reign of Elizabeth, the judges of the land recognised the same right and that other cases are to be found decidedly in favour of the principle one of the judges of that day quaintly observing, that it is the business of the parson pascere gregem verbo, exemplo, cibo. Indeed your Lordships will find both the Courts and Parliaments, as late as the reign of George III., recognising the claims of the poor against the parson, grounded upon the same principle."" Now you have it here distinctly maintained, even by Lord Brougham, that the poor have a right to relief; and if so, you have no right to claim any act of vassalage from them, or deprive them of their liberty as the price of giving them relief when they have a right to demand it. I will now assert, that if you refuse the poor relief, they have a right to take it. Will the Government dispute that point? The right hon. Gentleman the Home Secretary is silent. Am I to understand that he does not deny my position? [Sir G. GREY: One at a time.] But there are four of you going to have seats in the new Commission. You may depend upon it that you will be severely questioned, and that the debate tonight is only a slight sketch of what you will have to experience. To show you that the poor are justified in stealing, if not relieved, I will remind you of what Lord Bacon, one of the authors of the 43rd Elizabeth, says:  ""The law chargeth no man with default where the Act is compulsory. Where man's nature cannot overcome, such necessity carrieth with it a privilege in itself. Necessity is of three sorts:  987 necessity of conservation of life; necessity of obedience; and necessity of the act of God, or a stronger. First of conservation of life; if a man steal viands to satisfy his present hunger, his is not felony, nor larceny."" Judge Blackstone give this passage his high authority, and adds  ""This cannot now happen in England, where the Poor Law of Elizabeth suffers no one to be in a state of destitution."" I will now give you an authority which must be a high one with you, the Poor Law Commissioners themselves, who in one of their reports affirm that  ""To punish even depredation, apparently committed as the only resource against want, is repugnant to the common sentiments of mankind."" I have no doubt that also was the feeling of the gentleman in Worcestershire, who had six or seven tons of turnips taken every week by the poor. I have now proved my positions, and I have a right on the part of the suffering starving poor to require some explanation from the Government, whether they intend to carry out the Bill. There is one question on which I have a right to demand a distinct pledge. Are you intending to enforce the New Poor Law upon the same system as it has been administered for the last fourteen years with the intention of proceeding with it until you have abolished the Poor Law altogether? Or are you prepared to revert to the powers of the 43rd of Elizabeth? What has Ireland become from the want of a Poor Law? Why you have been obliged, as a last resort, to pass a Poor Law to save the people from destitution; and the hon. and learned Member for Bath, who has been the able supporter of that measure, has told you, that, to save Ireland, you must pass the 43rd of Elizabeth. Before many years are passed, you will have to rest upon the principles of that Act in England; I mean the principles of local self-government. You must have boards of guardians to assist in carrying out the law; but if they refuse to act under the Commissioners and they often do so refuse the poor are left to the tender mercies of the relieving officers to whom the poor are no more than the dirt they tread upon. No doubt during this discussion on the New Poor Law, many hon. Members will take part in the debate who can narrate what has been the working of the New Poor Law in the different parts of the country in which they reside. I can't refrain as I see the late Secretary of State for the Home Depart- 988 ment (Sir J. Graham) in his place I can't refrain from referring to a letter I have received within the last few days; for of all the accounts of the disgraceful conduct of poor-law unions, nothing surpasses the accounts of the Longtown Union, of which the right hon. Sir J. Graham, of Netherby Hall, is the president. The letter is written by the Rev. John Maughan, who dates from ""Bewcastle Rectory."" The writer gives a long account of the proceedings of the Poor Law Commissioners in screening parties who had robbed the ratepayers, and in preventing inquiry. Mr. Maughan concludes his letter by saying  ""The above facts are sufficient to show that there has been gross mismanagement of the Long-town Union, and gross negligence on the part of the Poor Law Commissioners themselves. Other facts might be mentioned of a similar nature, and too many others of a character too much resembling the atrocities of Andover."" That is the description of the Longtown Union by the rector of a parish in that union. No wonder that Mr. Parker was screened at least not screened, but that an attempt was made at the Home Office to induce him to destroy his report, lest The Times should be in the ribs of the late Home Secretary for the next six months. No wonder such things should be, when the late Home Secretary had in his own union atrocities as bad as at Andover. I have said, that the private defence of the Commissioners contains an audacious untruth, and I will prove it. I recommend this to the attention of the late Home Secretary, and the Government. [The hon. Member read the extract from the pamphlet, which he said was untrue.] In 1842, two reports were used against me (the hon. Member continued) in this House; but I will not, for particular reasons, allude to the subject further than to state, that in a report which was drawn up by Sir J. Walsham, the most harrowing and frightful details were given of the state of the poorhouse in the parish in which I reside. That report stated that forty-nine inmates of that workhouse slept in, I think, some twelve or fourteen beds. It was handed by the late Secretary of State for the Home Department (Sir J. Graham) to the right hon. Baronet the late First Lord of the Treasury (Sir R. Peel), who read the harrowing account to the House. The right hon. Gentleman (Sir R. Peel) turned up his eyes to heaven and smote his breast, and was horror-stricken at the poor being thus treated under my authority, as he was pleased to intimate for he pointed to  989 me at that time. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said, ""Yes, and within a mile and a quarter, too, of his (Mr. Ferrand's) own house."" They were delighted at the exposure; I was crushed for a season, but I believe I have now recovered. Now what was the state of that poorhouse on the last day on which the old law was in operation? It contained twelve inmates; but in the course of four years, under the management of the Poor Law Commissioners, the number of inmates increased to forty-nine; and from 1838 until 1842, when Sir J. Walsham visited the workhouse, I believe no Poor Law Commissioner had ever entered it. The late Prime Minister, after reading the report I have mentioned, said, ""It is high time for the Poor Law Commissioners to interfere."" The House shall hear how they did interfere. That report was got up against me in 1842; and when did the Poor Law Commissioners interfere to put a stop to the state of things which it represented as existing? Not until May, 1846, after the lapse of four years. Could anything be more disgraceful than this? The return of the assistant commissioner gives a flat contradiction to the bold assertions, the audacious untruths, which I have read from the defence of the Poor Law Commissioners. But what does the House suppose was the cause of this visit to the poorhouse? In May, 1846, I came down to this House and asked the right hon. Baronet (Sir R. Peel), who was then at the head of the Government, to insist upon an assistant poor-law commissioner being sent to Brugley to examine the state of the poorhouse. Let me state to the House the visits which had been paid to that union by the Commissioners during the few years preceding. On the 20th of July, 1842, Mr. Mott attended the meeting of the board of guardians; on the 17th of May, 1843, after an interval of ten months, Mr. Clements attended; twelve months afterwards, on the 8th of May, 1844, Mr. Clements paid the board another visit; and on the 2nd of October, 1844, the same person again visited them. And yet we were paying these men some 1,200l. or 1,400l. a year for performing their duties! The union was not again visited by an assistant Poor Law Commissioner until the 21st of May, 1846, after the lapse of a year and a half from the previous visit; and then that Commissioner was sent down at my request at the request of the man who had been traduced in this House in the 990 most scandalous manner by persons who ought to have been ashamed of their conduct. Upon my interference and at my request an assistant commissioner was sent down to rescue the poor from their sufferings; and what do hon. Gentlemen suppose was the state of the poorhouse? On the 9th of June, 1842, there were fifty-five inmates; on the 1st of January, 1843, forty-three; on the 1st of January, 1844, fifty-seven; on the 1st of January, 1845, forty-two; on the 1st of January, 1846, fifty-three; and on the 1st of January, 1847, forty-four; so that during two years out of the five, there was a larger number of inmates in the union poorhouse, than on the day when it was visited by Sir J. Walsham, at the suggestion of the late Secretary of State for the Home Department. Thus, then, I give a flat contradiction to the audacious statements of the Poor Law Commissioners in their private defence; and I could point out many other statements in that defence which are as unfounded and as untrue as that which I have just read. This, however, is sufficient to stamp the whole of that defence with falsehood, and to show that it is not worth the paper upon which it was written. Before I conclude I will merely ask the Government this simple question do you not believe, if you were to attempt to enforce the powers of this new Poor Law against the aristocracy or the middle classes of this country, that you would produce a rebellion within a week? There cannot be a doubt of it. Those classes of the English people would rise as one man to defend themselves against such tyranny and oppression. But it is the poor alone who are thus oppressed and persecuted; it is against them only that you enforce this harsh and cruel law. Let me ask you to choose a happier course to become the protectors of the poor instead of being their oppressors; for there is not on the face of God's earth a more loyal, a more peaceful, a more obedient, a more grateful, a more industrious body of working people than those within Old England; and what they have done to merit such treatment as this, neither I nor any other man in this country can understand or find out. They have borne this tyranny for thirteen years. How much longer do you intend them to submit to it? Depend upon it the day of reckoning must come. Amidst all their sufferings they are discontented from the knowledge that you have shown no pity for them that you  991 have deprived them of what God and the laws of their country have given them as a sacred and a legal right; and you cannot now appeal to them with the generous confidence you would have felt before the accursed principles of Malthus inoculated your laws. No; you have no right to appeal to them for allegiance if you refuse to protect them. Protect them with equal laws, equal rights, and equal liberty, and I have no fear for the peace of this country. Refuse them that protection, and the day must come when you will have reason to regret your oppression. I beg leave to move, Sir, that this Bill he read a second time this day six months."	-100.0	1847.0	1840
212442	212442	S3V0131P0-01370	1854-03-24	SETTLEMENT AND REMOVAL BILL.	MR. KNIGHT		"MR. KNIGHT said, he had long since been of opinion that the Law of Settlement was injurious to the poor; but subsequent reflection had led him to arrive at a contrary conclusion; he therefore could not give his assent to the Bill, seeing that it took away that law which had been as it were the title-deed of the poor to relief for the last 200 years. He did not blame the right hon. Gentleman at present at the head of the Poor Law Board for this Bill, for he was bound to say that his administration of the Poor Law had given entire satisfaction throughout the country; but he also felt persuaded that this measure was the first step towards the establishment of that dominant bureaucracy which Mr. Chadwick recommended to the Committee of 1847. It was the product of that harsh and starving party who, in 1834 and 1835, asserted that all charity was wrong, and that harshness and severity were the proper treatment for the labouring classes. Mr. Senior, one of the most active of the old Poor Law Commissioners who held these principles, advocated most strongly, before the Committee of 1847, the abolition of settlement. That gentleman had actually given it as his belief that ""what were called severity and harshness in the administration of relief were by far the best things for the labouring classes."" Then, again, Mr. Chadwick, another distinguished advocate of the same doctrine, had stated that  ""By the abolition of settlement, and by doing away with local administration, he would reduce the gross expense of the poor-law system by 1,000,000l., out of the 5,000,000l. to which it 1320 amounted, while he would increase the allowances to the officers."" The establishment charges of the system were at present about 750,000l.; and as it might fairly be supposed that Mr. Chadwick would raise those charges to 1,000,000l., it followed that he would reduce the 4,250,000l. at present devoted to the relief of distress by not less than 1,250,000l. Mr. Pashley stated that 3,000,000 persons were annually relieved, of whom 1,000,000 were children, and 300,000 able-bodied adults receiving temporary relief, leaving 1,700,000 crippled, disabled, or infirm persons. Now, who could wish to take away from these at least one-third of the relief they now received, or who could suppose that the poor would be benefited by such a measure? This Bill was in fact the result of a struggle on the part of property to get rid of the burden and of the duty of maintaining the poor, which had been imposed on them for 200 years by the Settlement Act; for the fact was, that for the ninety years before that Act was passed, the poor could get no relief their right to it was only a joke. Now when, in 1832, property struggled to get rid of the poor, it was perfectly justified in doing so, because, under the system previously in force, the able-bodied poor could insist on relief, whether they worked or not; but that injustice no longer continued. The workhouse test had enabled property to throw off the burden of maintaining these people; a great migration had taken place from the agricultural counties of Somersetshire, Devonshire, and Dorsetshire, to time manufacturing districts; and at this moment the poor rate was little more than one shilling in the pound upon the rental of England. Indeed, during the last seventeen years it had only once risen to ls. 3d. in the pound the sum which it reached within thirty years after the Act of Settlement was passed. Under these circumstances, he contended that property was not justified in throwing off the burden of maintaining the aged, disabled, and infirm. This measure was not the emanation of the present, but the old Poor Law Commissioners, who long contended for the total abolition of out-door relief, on the gound that harshness and severity in the administration of out-door relief was by far the best method of consulting the interests of the poor. To show the spirit with which those whom he regarded as the real authors of this measure were actu-  1321 ated, he would refer to their evidence before the Committee of 1847. Mr. Coode stated, in answer to the question whether the abolition of the Law of Settlement might not lead to a great migration of poor into certain parishes, answered that this might be met by additional care in the administration of the relief. Mr. Gulson stated that its effect might be that some work might be taken from those who now received it because they had a settlement; but then he said that the work would be done by better workmen, and that the poor who were thrown out of work would get a fair amount of relief. But the Poor Law was not intended for the benefit of able-bodied workmen, but for that of the poor, for whom it was to find food and employment. It was evident to such of them as now received employment on account of their settlement this measure would be an unmitigated hardship. Sir George Nichols was another strenuous advocate of this measure. What were his feelings towards the poor? He told the same Committee that there was a strong feeling at the time the new Poor Law was passed that relief should be confined to the workhouse; and that the then Poor Law Commissioners worked strenuously for three or four years to reduce out-door relief. If he (Mr. Knight) recollected aright, they continued their exertions without, in fact, effecting much reduction, until they were pulled up by the Andover Committee. He believed that if the theories of Sir George Nichols had then been carried out, the people of England would have been driven into rebellion, for he did not think that it was possible that the poor should have been forced into the workhouse or left to starve. The next thing to consider was, what had been the effect of the Law of Settlement? The best way to decide that question was to compare the condition of the poor 200 years ago, when that law was passed, with what it was now. It must be recollected that before that law was passed they had as full a right to relief as they would have if the present Bill passed; and yet such was then their condition, that it was said that some remedy was wanted to prevent them from perishing, old and young, for want of such supplies as were necessary. On the other hand, in 1835, Mr. Senior, in his preface to the foreign communications appended to the Report of the Poor Law Commissioners, stated that their result was to show that the labour- 1322 ing classes of England were in a more favourable condition than those of the continental countries as to the money rate of wages, as to the quantity of produce which they received for their labour, and (with the exception of Norway) as to the rate of mortality. He believed that the enactment of the Settlement Law had been a great element in this enormous improvement. Such had been the result of the present law; what would be the effect of the Bill now before the House? If it were passed, and trade became dull in the manufacturing districts, and the people seemed likely to be out of work for some time, the guardians of those Unions might, by severity, drive them by fifties and hundreds into the agricultural Unions, which, not being able to receive them, must, in their turn, repel them by corresponding harshness. Again, suppose such a strike as that at Preston occurred; the leaders of the work people might ascertain what workhouses were empty, might send there the whole of the surplus population-of the district where the strike occurred, and thus commence the fight against the masters, after having quartered their army on the country. The Law of Settlement had defended the poor against property, and had prevented those clearances which had taken place to so large an extent in Ireland and Scotland, for want of such a protection to the labouring population. In one parish of Sutherlandshire, in consequence of these clearances, the number of houses had been reduced between 1801 and 1841 from 286 to forty-three, and the population had diminished within the same period by more than 1,200 persons. The decrease of houses and of population was in this instance attributable to the fact that the parish had been turned into six sheep farms. A settlement combined with the right to relief had prevented clearances in England. Before settlement was established, clearances went on and evictions took place to an immense amount in England. The fact was that the great object of settlement was to stop clearances, and it did stop them in England. God forbid that property should ever be allowed to shake off that liability to which it had been subject for 200 years the support of its settled poor, and that it should ever again acquire that tremendous power which it exercised so ruthlessly before settlement was established. There was another paint of great consequence, namely, district chargeability, of the trial of which they had abun-  1323 dance of examples. He contended that no instance of Poor Law had yet been known in any part of the world in which district chargeability had been successful, unless it had been in certain neighbourhoods in which the rich knew all the poor whom they employed. Although every argument in favour of Union rating must be theoretical, there were many instances of the trial and complete failure of district rating. By the 14th of Elizabeth the chargeability was on petty sessional divisions. The consequence was that the poor could get no relief, and they starved. It was found that a Poor Law established upon the principle of district rating was wholly useless. Sir Francis Bacon brought in a Bill to prevent clearances, on which occasion he stated, that clearances had been more rife and more cruel within the last few years than ever they had been before, and that that was in consequence of the system of district chargeability. Then it was that the 39th of Elizabeth was passed, which changed that system. He would mention another instance of the failure of district chargeability. By the 39th of Elizabeth the system of district rating remained in force in the large parishes in the north of England, and that system was continued for some sixty years, but it totally and entirely failed. The poor were driven in every direction, and were left to starve. The remedy adopted was the Law of Settlement, and the abolition of district chargeability, with the division of the large parishes into small townships. One consequence of this arrangement had been, that for the last half century these townships had been more lightly rated than any other part of England. A third trial of district chargeability had been made in the present reign. In 1838, when a Poor Law was first introduced into Ireland, district chargeability was established, but it was soon discovered that the areas of rating were too large, and within ten years it was found necessary to reduce the extent of the districts. That reduction was attended with the same beneficial results which had been experienced in England, and the Poor Law of Ireland had since been a real working institution. It was the forced employment of the poor in England that prevented such an unhappy state of things arising in this country as had so long prevailed in Ireland. Had there been a Law of Settlement in Ireland when that law came into operation in England and had every township in Ireland been obliged to feed or employ its own po- 1324 pulation, nearly all the crime and misery which had prevailed in that unhappy country would have been prevented. Much had been said respecting the restriction of the area of labour. In Ireland the area of labour was open enough, and when property in that country became divided into small portions, and either the employment or the feeding of the poor was rendered compulsory, employment would at once begin. If there had been a law in Ireland which recognised the full right to relief of the poor, at the same time that settlement was established in England, he believed that those fearful stories of Irish clearances, which for 150 years had disgraced humanity, would not and could not have taken place. He believed, also, that absenteeism would have been absolutely stopped by such a law; for if the poor had had a legal and recognised claim to a large portion of the income of every landowner, he could not have deserted the country, and gone to Paris or Rome, and left the poor to starve. In England, when a poor old and infirm man was in want, he could get from his parish something to support himself and his family; but when a poor man was in that condition in Ireland there was nothing for him but to lie down in his cabin and die. The law came upon him for everything that he had for his rent and his tithe; but it gave no compensating provision to him in his hour of need. The poor man in Ireland had not got hold enough on the soil to enable him to become as quiet and contented a man as the English pauper. We might talk of the unruly Irish poor, but history told us that the English poor were far more unruly and rebellious than the Irish were before settlement was established. Let them take away settlement, and drive an Englishman from place to place, and they would find him a more savage and turbulent animal than ever an Irishman was. The consequence of the law in Ireland had been, that they had had to keep 40,000 policemen and soldiers to garrison the property of Ireland against her poorer classes. The effect in England of settlement was, that it settled the people on the soil, and gave them a right to share in the property of the soil to an extent limited only to their wants, and prior to the property of the landlord, and of which the landlord could not deprive them. In Scotland there was also a right of settlement, but as the able-bodied were not entitled to relief, the settlement was to a great extent useless. In a village in Scotland some time ago the  1325 owner of some cottages, desiring to get rid of the tenants, engaged a ship to take between 200 and 300 of them to America, but when the ship arrived sixty refused to go. Their houses were then pulled down, and many of the homeless and friendless cottiers, becoming frantic with grief, were driven to seek for shelter in the neighbouring quarries and among the rocks with which the district abounded. Now, had those poor persons lived in England, instead of the Highlands, they would all have been on the poor-roll and been entitled to relief. In the west of Ireland there were whole streets unroofed. Why? To prevent the people who were being cleared taking refuge in them. He might go on, but he thought he had proved that settlement was an advantage to the poor. With respect to close parishes being relieved, as it was said they were, at the expense of open parishes, the evidence was very strong to show that the parish in which a man lived was that which was benefited by his labour. Taking the property assigned to the income tax as a criterion, it was proved by unquestionable statistics that the rates of increase in populous and open parishes had been very much larger than in those which were called close. With respect to the equalisation of the poor rate, the question was whether it was required. He found, on looking into the matter, that an immense equalisation had been going on since the French war that, in fact, everything which they proposed to do by this Bill had been doing itself by degrees, and the country had been making great progress in this matter in a quiet way without any disturbance. Since the recent alterations of the law the number of removals had diminished from 33,000 to 11,000, and in the same way the equalisation of the poor rate had been going on. In the year 1815 the difference between the highest rated county and the lowest rated county was 3s. 111/4d. in the pound. Sussex, which was then the highest, was rated at 5s. 01/2d. in the pound, and Northumberland, which was the lowest, at 1s. 11/4d.; in 1851 the highest was ls. 11d. and the lowest was 1s. 1d.; so that they would see that the process of civilisation had been gradually going on. Much had been said about the evils of a national rate, and the right hon. Gentleman the President of the Poor Law Board had admitted them, at the time of introducing the Bill. If they were to have a national rate, let them have a real national rate, let the maintenance of 1326 the poor be thrown on the Consolidated Fund, and the Poor Law abolished. This, however, was not the object of this measure; it did not propose to throw the bur-then of providing for the poor upon all property equally; but if it should be passed, and should continue for ten years, they would have the same local taxes levied all over England, and administered by paid officials. With greater county Unions, such as Mr. Chadwick had described, and such as they would ultimately come to if this Bill should pass, it would be impossible for the unpaid guardians to devote their time to the relief of the poor and the administration of the law. Property would lose its influence, the energies of the population would be crippled, and nothing could stave off that state to which France, by a system of centralisation, had already been reduced. The inequalities of the present system were far more tolerable than those which would be introduced if that system should be broken up. At present, if a man bought an estate, the average amount of the local burdens was matter of calculation between himself and the seller, and the price was fixed with reference to these burdens. The inequalities of the parochial system, therefore, were not hard to bear; but if they broke up that system, they would introduce inequalities which would be most unfair, and would, therefore, be hard to be endured. People could hardly realise the immense amount of property which would change hands by this compulsory process of equalisation. An addition of 2s. in the pound to the rate of a parish would take every tenth house and every tenth acre from the present proprietors, for the benefit of the poor, and he contended that no case had been made out which could justify such a proceeding, and that all the arguments and all the statistics which had been brought forward in support of it had broken down."	-55.0	1854.0	1850

KNIGHT said, it seemed to him, that although the battle upon that question had been hitherto fought upon strong grounds, the strongest ground for opposing a union rating had not as yet been taken up. The only experience of a Poor Law in the world, with the small exception of Denmark, was in England; and if they wished to ascertain the probable results of any great change in regard to this subject they must look to the past history of the English Poor Law. He thought that history thoroughly established this fact, that no forced charity, by means of a Poor Law, could be worked successfully over any areas of chargeability except the areas of natural charity areas in which the rich and the poor were known to each other., and in which the money was paid by those persons to whom, without a Poor Law, the poor would naturally turn for help in the hour of need. They would find that there had been repeated instances, extending from the first commencement of our Poor Law to the present generation, of large areas of chargeability having been tried the result having been, in every instance, a reduction of these areas of rating from the proved impossibility of working them; and he felt quite certain, if this Bill passed, and large areas were again established in England, that the moment a real pressure came upon the rates those areas would be found perfectly unworkable, whilst the greatest confusion and misery would arise, and they would have to be reduced again to the areas of natural charity. When employment was pressing upon labour when men could  159 find work in all parts of England we might almost get on without any Poor Law, but the moment the population pressed upon employment, and the moment a Poor Law became really necessary, not only in a single district, but all over the country, that which had repeatedly happened before would occur again, and the large areas would become one mass of inextricable confusion. Not only in England, but in Ireland and Scotland, these large areas had failed. The first instance is coeval with the existence of a forced Poor Law, which was first established in England by the 14th of Elizabeth. The burden of maintaining the poor was then thrown, not on each parish, but on the whole inhabitants of petty sessional divisions. That, however, was found not to answer. Twenty-six years afterwards the same Ministers who had introduced the system felt compelled to reduce the rating area, and by the 39th Elizabeth the parochial divisions were made the areas of Poor Law charge-ability. The next instance of the failure of large areas of chargeability occurred in the time of Charles II. when all the large parishes in England and Wales were divided into townships for the support of the poor. It was found at that time that in all the smaller parishes the law was better administered, and the wants of the poor better cared for than in the larger parishes, where, notwithstanding the existence of the law, many persons, old and young, had died from the want of the necessaries of life. The preamble of this Act of Charles II. recites that  ""The inhabitants of certain northern counties and of many other counties in England and Wales, by reason of the largeness of the parishes within the same, have not, nor cannot reap the benefits of the Poor Law of Elizabeth;"" and the Act reduces the areas of charge-ability in these large parishes to townships and villages. The effect of this Act was to increase the number of places maintaining their own poor in England and Wales from about 10,000 to about 15,000; and in these reduced areas the Poor Law has worked without difficulty ever since. The next great instance of the forced reduction of large areas of chargeability occurred in the present generation. In 1838, when the Poor Law was first established in Ireland, the Poor Law Commissioners had recently been beaten in their attempt to establish large areas in England. They, however, succeeded in establishing large 160 areas in Ireland, and what was the result? Ten years later, when hard times came upon the people of the sister country, the Government had to appoint a Commission called the Boundary Commission to subdivide those large areas, and to reduce them to the areas of natural charity. The Boundary Commissioners state in their first Report that they found the unions in the north and east of Ireland in a far better condition than those in the south and west, and assign, as a chief reason, the fact that the electoral divisions were smaller and more nearly coterminous with property. Indeed they say throughout, that in their re-adjustment of the electoral districts they ""Endeavoured to compose them of single properties, or groups of properties, in order that the stimulus and individual interest might be exerted for the improvement of the country and the condition of the people."" In their eighth Report, dated February, 1850, they say  ""We found, as a general rule, that the largest town divisions were usually those in which the greatest pressure existed....And we had little doubt that injustice was done to the more distant rural portions of those electoral divisions, by the support being thrown upon them of the persons who swelled the population of the towns. From this we endeavoured to liberate them, by confining the electoral division to the space benefited by its proximity to the town, and we departed from the parish boundaries, when by doing so we could make the town more central....The areas, accordingly, attached to towns, will generally be found to be limited to lands within a circuit of one or two miles, and, so far as has been practicable, coterminous with the boundaries of properties....In support of our general view of reducing the town areas, we may state, that we find the principal towns in the north of Ireland, as Londonderry, Belfast, and others, with very small areas; in the case of Londonderry, only 767 acres; while the rates on those towns have been moderate. In fact the very magnitude of the rateable district has been represented to us, and with great apparent reason, as one of the causes which has led to the present pressure on the rates, from the laxity which has been introduced by it, and not only as having caused it, but as likely to be ruinous in the end to the towns themselves."" Thus within our own time, and with all the advantages that could be derived from a central administration and from the union system, the principle of extended areas sought to be established by this Bill has been fully tried, and its signal and rapid failure has caused this third great national example of the forced reduction of widely extended areas of rating to the areas of natural charity areas which  161 allow of mutual knowledge and a common interest between the payers and the recipients of a forced legal charity. The stress the Commissioners place throughout as the advantages of the boundaries of properties being coterminous with those of areas of chargeability, affords a great practical contradiction to those who talk of the evils of such areas in England, and stigmatise them as close parishes. Now, as regards the Scotch Poor Law, it should be observed that in the Lowlands, where the parishes were small, the law worked well. On the contrary, in the Highlands, where the areas for rating were immensely large, much misery and starvation have existed since the establishment of a New Poor Law in Scotland. He (Mr. Knight) believed that the proper remedy was pointed out in a passage which he recollected in the Report of the Scotch Commission of Poor Law Inquiry. It was there stated that, previously to the passing of the New Poor Law, some of these large Highland districts had in seasons of distress adopted a system which was called the ""quartering system."" The large parish was divided into five or six small quartering districts or neighbourhoods, and each house in these reduced districts took its turn in giving quarters to a certain portion of the poor and infirm. A division of the large highland parishes into such neighbourhoods for Poor Law chargeability, would, he doubted not, make the Poor Law in the Highlands a practical reality, and would be quite a parallel to the division of the large parishes in the North of England into townships. He hoped he might, live to see such a division take place. There were many other instances of the failure of large areas of chargeability to work well for instance, about the time of Queen Anne, some ten or twelve unions had been found for rating purposes by private Acts of Parliament. Most of these were of very small area, merely uniting the parish of a town. But the largest of these unions, Norwich, consisted of forty three parishes, and in extent from 4,000 to 5,000 acres. Here the union system had worked as ill as possible, and Norwich had been ever since its union one of the most highly rated, and yet the most miserable district in all England. More complaints came from Norwich than almost any other union, and while it, cried for a larger area, he thought it had too large an area at present. The late Mr. Buller, when at the head of the Poor Law 162 Board, sent gentlemen round the country to inquire into the state of different districts; all seemed to have started with a determination to make out a case for union rating. The Commissioner (Mr. Beckett) sent to inquire into the condition of the poor of Norwich, and into the causes of its extreme wretchedness, says  ""The subject of rating is beset with difficulty as far as Norwich is concerned, for its parishes are already united for the support of the poor, and whatever advantages are to be derived from the union system, it is now in the possession of. This system is found to be wholly inadequate as a remedy for the evils of which Norwich complains, and it is, therefore, no matter of surprise that the ratepayers should look to a national rate as their only hope of deliverance from the very heavy burden under which they are suffering."" The ratepayers of Norwich looked to a national rate as their only relief from the heavy burden of union rating. Now, he (Mr. Knight) contended that if they were to repeal the Act of Queen Anne, and allow the forty three parishes of Norwich to form separate boards for the relief of the poor of each parish, the misery of that place would soon cease, and the rates would be reduced. Another instance of the failure of the Poor Law to work satisfactorily in large areas was that of the large London parishes. Here the administration of the Poor Law had broken down. The rates in some of them were very high, and the poor died in the streets of starvation. A few years ago the whole country was in a fire of indignation at the disclosures about the Andover Union; but a single weekly paper at any time during the winter would recount in the metropolis twenty times the honors which were brought, before the public on that occasion. He believed that a division of the large London parishes, such as was now being made for ecclesiastical purposes by the Bishop of London, and not an extension of the area, was the only mode in which relief could be obtained. In Paris, in 1848, we saw the experiment tried of putting a great city in one great area for the relief of its starving population. The attempt plunged the city in hopeless confusion. The expenditure became unmanageable, and the whole attempt was a miserable failure. It was another instance of the failure of a large area, and very possibly it was that which prevented the right hon. Gentleman at the head of the Poor Law Board from proposing to deal with London distress, which cried loudly for  163 change, while he tried his experiments in the country when the Poor Laws were working tolerably well and without much complaint. Against all these instances of the breakdown of the Poor Law in large areas, the President of the Poor Law Board brought forward only one instance of its assumed success. He had brought forward the case of Docking Union with a paean of triumph as the one which settled beyond all doubt the superiority of union rating over the existing system; and if that case failed it might be considered as certain that no example was known to the Poor Law officials of a case of success. The President had relied wholly on the Docking case to exemplify the success that was to attend his plan. He (Mr. Knight) had therefore gone carefully into the case of Docking, and would show the House that no favourable precedent could be founded upon it. The President of the Poor Law Board (Mr. Villiers) had garbled the case in a manner common to Poor Law officials by means of short statistics he had made out a case of success. But the facts were these: during the first eight years in which union rating had been established in Docking Union the poor rates had steadily increased to the amount of 19 per cent; then followed a decrease, not of Docking Union alone, but of most of the adjoining unions. Thus taking the average poor rate of Docking Union for the three years, 1846-7-8, before union rating had been established there, and comparing them with the average rate of the last three years, of which an account is published namely, 1861-2-3, a decrease has taken place in the poor rates of Docking Union of 18 per cent. But during the same period the poor rates of the adjoining union of Swaffham has decreased 24 per cent; of the adjoining union of Aylsham 21 per cent; and of the adjoining union of Erpingham 191/2 per cent. Now, it is not open to the right hon. Gentleman to say Look at Docking, it has decreased 18 per cent, because it has adopted union rating, and to quote it as an overwhelming proof of the success of his plan, without its being pointed out that Swaffham had decreased 24 per cent, because it had adhered to the contrary system. The population of Docking Union had steadily increased in every census from 1801 to 1851, and it was not until union rating was established that a decrease commenced. Between 1851 and 1861 there 164 had been a decrease of between 700 and 800 persons in nineteen parishes of Docking Union. Now the only clue to be found to this decrease was in the speech of the right hon. Gentleman in bringing in the Bill. He said (quoting the Chairman of Docking Union) that second rate or partially able-bodied labourers, if unable to find work in their own parishes, went further a field in search of work. It was clear that they went out of the union; in fact that they had been driven out of the union by the harshness and severity of the union system. Whenever the population in an agricultural district decreased, it was held by the Poor Law Board that this was occasioned by some sort of cruelty, and on the right hon. Gentleman's own principle it appeared that the poor had been driven from the Docking Union. The President of the Poor Law Board in bringing in this Bill made great capital of a Report by a medical man, Dr. Hunter. He had grounded on it that part of his case which referred to overcrowding in agricultural parishes. Very few Members had seen that Report, which had not been delivered to the House. Dr. Hunter had been sent all over the country, a careful examination was made in every county, and in many parishes, and a Report was made as to the number of cottages, what they were built of, and other details. But according to that Report there was next to no hardship on the score of overcrowding in the parishes he visited in only one of these, Netherly, the seat of a late Baronet long a Member of that House, were persons described as being huddled together seven or eight in a house. Finding little in the parishes he visited out of which to make a case, Dr. Hunter appears to have examined the census, and extracted the names of 821 parishes in which houses had decreased, while the inhabitants had increased between 1851 and 1861. Not a word was said by Dr. Hunter of their being agricultural or close parishes. In fact, it turned out that a great many of them were town parishes, yet the president of the Poor Law Board, in bringing in the Bill, had most unfairly called them agricultural parishes. Dr. Hunter gave the statement without mentioning the name of a single parish out of the 821, the names of which he had had great difficulty in extracting from the right hon. Gentleman at the head of the Poor Law Board. But, for the sake of argument, supposing the Report to be true, it was clear on the face of it that no overcrowding existed in those 821  165 parishes. The Report showed that the average number of persons to a house in those parishes in 1851 was 4*41, while in 1861 it was 4*87. But the average number of persons per house in England and Wales was in 1851 5*469, and in 1861 5.366. So that the chief thing this list of 821 parishes shows is, that in 1851 they had in them a large surplus of houses over population; and in 1861, although the ratio of surplus had been to some extent diminished, in some parishes by a decrease of houses, and in others by an increase of people, yet even then, as compared with the whole of England and Wales, these 821 parishes were still much overhoused as regarded their existing population. Since the commencement of the New Poor Law there had been a most extraordinary shifting of the population of England. It arose from two causes the refusal of out-door relief to able-bodied persons, and cheap railway transport. This had been the case, more or less, in almost every part of the country, and particularly in the West of England. But it ought to be observed that all this had arisen since, and was referable to, the operation of the New Poor Law, and was not the result of the old parochial system. When he (Mr. Knight) named such places as Devizes, Trowbridge, Great Bradford, Westbury, Warminster, Heytesbury, Ames-bury, Salisbury, Cricklade, Corsham, Chippenham, Calne, Beaminster, Bridport, Whitchurch, Shaftesbury, Sturminster, Shepton Mallet, Wiveliscombe, Milverton, Nailsea, Yatton, Ilminster, Chard, Crewkerne, South Petherton, Ilchester, Castle Gary, Wincauton, Glastonbury, Anbridge, Cheddar, Tiverton, Bath, Bathford, Ashburton, Dartmouth, Totnes, Axminster, Honiton, Topsham, Chudleigh, Okehampton, and Crediton, as among the many towns in the West of England in which houses, or population, or both, had decreased between the Census of 1841 and that of 1851, he (Mr. Knight) could not allow that a corresponding decrease in any small agricultural parishes in the district could fairly be attributed to any other cause than a general resettling of the population under a new order of things, occasioned in great part by the action of the prohibitory order of the New Poor Law. It would be monstrous to assert that the diminution in houses or people in the towns he had named had been caused by a conspiracy on the part of the landlords to ease the poor rates, and that argument 166 was equally false when applied to small parishes affected in like manner. The right hon. Gentleman, in introducing the Bill, had named the several Committees which had applied themselves to the subject of areas of rating. All the arguments brought forward in favour of an extension of the area of rating had turned on two points first, the great injustice of inequality of rating; and, secondly, the close parish system a term invented since the New Poor Law. But the injustice of inequality was not done away with by this Bill; because, whether it was a parish or a union that paid 6d., while another parish or union paid 5s., the great injustice of inequality remained the same. For his own part, when complaint was made of the inequality of rating, he confessed he did not see, when a property was purchased or inherited, why the purchaser or descendant should take what he had not purchased, or his predecessor did not possess before him. He (Mr. Knight) should next consider the close parish case, which was a new term invented since the New Poor Law by the Poor Law officials. He (Mr. Knight) had gone most carefully into the matter, and would show the House that no evidence was before the country of the existence of a system of demolishing cottages in small parishes for the sake of diminishing the poor rates. Nothing could be so easy for the Poor Law Board as to name the parishes in which this bad taken place, if it really had done so; but in all the parishes they had so named at different times the contrary was proved, as the census showed that in almost every instance cottages bad increased in the parishes accused of having destroyed them. He (Mr. Knight) would examine seriatim the various attempts of the Poor Law Board to impress this House and the country with the idea that such a system existed. The first attempt was made before Mr. Charles Buller's Committee in 1847. Many Poor Law officials came forward to detail the horrors of the system, but as they did not give the names of the parishes they afforded no clue by which their assertions could be verified. Mr. Hall, one of the Poor Law Inspectors, took a different course. He said he did not believe that cottages had been pulled down, and produced in support of his opinion the following facts: Mr. Hall's district comprised 44 unions, 24 of which contained no close parish. In the other 20  167 unions, 76 close parishes existed. Between 1831 and 1841, houses in these 76 close parishes had increased 11 per cent, population had increased 9 per cent. In only 6 parishes out of the 76 had houses decreased. Mr. Hall gave the names of each parish and the figures for the census. This was the only real evidence given on the close parish case before the Committee of 1847. All the rest was mere outcry. Neither Mr. Charles Buller nor the Committee were satisfied. They passed a resolution for union rating, but determined it should not be reported to the House. After the sitting of that Committee, Mr. Buller sent eight Poor Law Inspectors into the country to see whether the close parish system existed or not They were sent into 14 different counties, and the result was printed. He (Mr. Knight) had spent several months in working out the results, which he had placed before the House in a private pamphlet in 1854. The extracts from the census therein contained showing the number of houses and persons in the parishes selected by the Commissioners as close parishes, showed that houses had largely increased in most of them. As a consequence Mr. Baines, in bringing forward his Motion for union rating, gave up the close parish case, and the charge of pulling down cottages. The number of close parishes reported on was 247, and the increase of the houses in those parishes was 44 per cent. The increase of the population in the same period was very much less. The most curious thing in this inquiry was, that the amount of real property rated to the property tax between 1815 and 1843, in the parishes which were said to have been injured by having population driven into them by the close parishes, had increased immensely, while in the close parishes it had increased very little indeed. In 40 open parishes the increase had been 56 per cent, while in the corresponding close parishes the increase had been only 5 per cent, and throughout in similar proportion. The cause for this was obvious, for, assuming the old division of agricultural produce to be correct, and that one-third went to the labourers, that proportion must have been spent by them in those open parishes in which they lived. The theory put forward on the management of property was, that one-third of the gross produce of a farm went to the rent, one-third to labour, and one-third to the farmer. Now, if there could be imagined a district of 30,000 acres, in which 168 the cottages were pulled down, and the labourers driven into an adjoining parish, one-third of the whole produce of the district must be spent in that parish; and it would become thriving at the expense of the other parishes. There was no instance of a town which complained of the poor being driven in on them that was not benefited. For instance, the town of Spalding complained that it was injured by being made the place of residence of the labouring population of a large neighbouring extra-parochial district called Deeping Fen; but, on inquiry, it was found that more than PS10,000 a year was carried in to Spalding by people who earned their wages in Deeping Fen. Within a short period the valuation of that town had trebled, and it was quite clear that the increase was in no small degree owing to the PS10,000 which had been so brought into Spalding from Deeping Fen for a great many years. The close parish case appeared to be dead as regarded the charge of pulling down cottages, and remained so for some years. It was, however, resuscitated in 1860 by the right hon. Gentleman (Mr. Villiers), on his becoming Chairman of the Irremovable Poor Committee. He (Mr. Villiers) brought forward witnesses who re-asserted the old cry of pulling down houses, &c. The Committee, however, refused to listen to such statements unless the names of the parishes were given, and evidence of the number of houses in each of such parishes, at every census since 1801, was afterwards given before the Committee. Five close parishes were spoken of near Lowth; but it appeared that in 1801 the number of houses in them was 82; in 1841, 151; and in 1851, 171; one was mentioned near Wakefield, in which the houses at those periods were 10, 9, and 9; two near Royston, in which the houses were 18, 44, and 64; four near Lincoln, in which the houses were 109, 173, and 206; one near Sunderland, in which the houses were 55, 78, and 86; five near Leeds, in which the houses were 523, 899,and 1,018; five near Birkenhead, in which the houses were 82, 94, and 100; five near Chesterfield, in which the houses were 653,867, and 1,086; in only two out of the whole of the close parishes brought forward before this Committee had houses decreased. The increase of houses in those parishes from 1801 to 1841 was 51 per cent; and from 1841 to 1851 22 per cent. No failure could have been more calamitous than that of the right hon. Gentleman (Mr. C. P. Villiers') wit-  169 nesses in their attempt to show to the Irremovable Committee the existence of close parishes in which houses had been destroyed. He (Mr. Knight) maintained that the charge of pulling down houses in close parishes had been disproved in every case, and the right hon. Gentleman had no right to bring the charge forward again without fresh proofs, of which, however, it appeared he had none to give. The whole charge appeared to be a false and an invented one. There was one more Committee of which Mr. Villiers had spoken namely, his own Committee, which reported in 1864, having taken evidence for three years, but they took no evidence on the subject of the extension of the area of rating throughout the country. The Chairman, in his draft Report, referred to it as a subject out of their sphere, as not having been specifically referred to them; yet, at the last moment, he (Mr. Villiers) placed three new Members on the Committee, who were known to be much in favour of union rating, but who had taken no part whatever in the proceedings of the Committee. One of these new Members proposed a clause in favour of union rating, and carried it without its having reference to any part of the evidence taken by the Committee, or to its former proceedings. The right hon. Gentleman opposite (Mr. C. P. Villiers), in his opening speech, had attributed to the parochial system a great many abuses which did not belong to it. No doubt it would be in the recollection of many hon. Members that the chief evils sought to be remedied by the Act of 1834 were not occasioned by the parochial system. In 1794, there was great distress for food, and the country was in great danger; alterations were made in the Poor Law, with the unanimous consent of Parliament. It was then that much that was complained of in 1834 arose. What was granted to the poor as a favour in 1794, was revoked by Parliament in 1834. But the parochial system had gone on for 200 years without any of the grievances which were attributed to it in 1834. As they were now talking about having another Committee, he thought it was but right that the House should know that all attempts which had been made to prove the close parish system of pulling down houses had been perfectly futile. It was clear that two-thirds of the ratepayers of England would be injured by this Bill. I was quite clear that the ratepayers, as 170 a body, would not be benefited by it, and he thought it was equally clear that the Bill would be of no advantage to the poor. The only persons who would benefit by it were the officials of Gwyder House. Those officials had as yet held their position by a precarious tenure, That sister establishment, the Board of Health, which had intended to lord it over the towns in the same way as the Poor Law Board sought to lord it over the parishes, had been swept away, and Gwyder House felt that the question might also come to be asked What was the use of that establishment? It was not improbable that some future financial reformer would bring before the House the useless expenditure which took place at Gwyder House. It might be easy to prove that thousands of letters were written on such weighty matters as whether or not a pauper boy was to have a pair of new breeches. But that was not sufficient to justify its continued existence. There was little or nothing for that large and expensive establishment to do. The officials knew that as long as the parochial areas and parochial officers existed there would be no difficulty in returning to a cheaper and less centralized system of poor relief. And if, instead of millions of surplus some future year should show a deficit, the Poor Law Board might be thought a proper item to be struck out of the Estimates; but if they could succeed in smashing up the parishes, they thought that they would be sure of their salaries for the space of their natural lives. This, then, was the real cause of all the false statements that had been made about close parishes and pulling down cottages, and this was the foundation of the present Bill."	-67.0	1865.0	1860
433436	433436	S3V0241P0-01300		RESOLUTION.	MR. M'CARTHY DOWNING,		"MR. M'CARTHY DOWNING, in rising to call attention to the anomalous state of the Laws under which the destitute poor receiving relief from the poor's rate are subject to removal in England and Scotland, and by virtue of which destitute poor persons born in Ireland and so relieved are subject to deportation from England and Scotland to Ireland; and to move  ""That said Laws in their operation inflict many wrongs and cause great sufferings; that they are unjust and impolitic therefore. That, in the opinion of this House, the said Laws ought to be so amended as that every poor person who shall have maintained himself or herself for twelve months by some industrial occupation in any parish, combination of parishes, or union in England, Wales, or Scotland, previously to receiving such relief, shall not be subject to removal therefrom,"" said, he felt that it was unnecessary to enter into the origin of the laws of settlement and the liability of districts to support their own poor, because of their having been so modified by subsequent legislation. He would therefore 654 apply himself to the laws as he now found them and to the evils which still remained. Up to the year 1819 persons subject to removal should have committed an act of vagrancy; they should be proved to be rogues, vagabonds, or vagrants; but by the Act of 59 Geo. III., commonly called ""Sturges Bourne's Act,"" powers were for the first time given to remove persons who had become chargeable as destitute poor, from which time vagabondism and poverty had been classed in the same category, and under which, and subsequent Acts amending the same, wrongs and sufferings had been imposed of a character beyond the possible conception or belief of the House. Accounts of them would be found in the evidence given before the Select Committee of 1854, appointed on the Motion of Mr. Baines, the then President of the English Poor Law Board, and in Returns which he (Mr. M'Carthy Downing) obtained by orders of the House in 1871 and 1875. From the year 1846 Parliament had shown a growing tendency to restrict the right of removal. In that year it was provided that no person in England or Wales could be removed from a parish in which he had been resident for five years next before the application for removal. In 1861 the period of three years was substituted for that of five, and ""residence in the Union"" was substituted for ""residence in the parish."" In 1865 the period of residence was reduced to one year mitigations, no doubt, of the evils of the system existing previously, but by no means a solution for the restriction of removal did not confer a right of settlement or permanent chargeability, and unless residence was kept up, the restriction on removal ceased that was to say, that although a man might have lived a year in a Union, yet if he went to another, and received relief in it before he had spent 12 months there, he was liable to be sent to some place determined by what remained of the old law of settlement and by the modern laws of removal. But what was the state of the law of chargeability and removal in Scotland? To obtain a settlement there, a person must have resided five years in a parish before seeking relief, and that settlement was lost if, in any subsequent five years, the person did not reside for one year in it; while, in Ire-  655 land, there was no law of settlement nor power of removal. They had, therefore, a complete conflict of laws in the United Kingdom, differing to such an extent that it would be thought impossible under a common Imperial Legislature. He (Mr. M'Carthy Downing) would first take the case as it stood between England and Scotland. An English labourer was protected from removal by a year's residence, but let him cross the Border and happen to fall destitute in Scotland, he was deprived of the benefit of the humane improvements in the English law; while the Scotchman who had not obtained even in Scotland a settlement by a five years' residence in a parish, and subsequently resided for 12 months in an English Union, had all the benefits of the English law. There was no law of settlement nor of removal in Ireland, and no law of inter-union chargeability; chargeability was regulated by residence, varied since 1838 by five distinct Acts of Parliament; in some cases, it was four years' residence in an electoral division out of five in the Union; in another, 30 months out of three years. The chargeability arising from birth or marriage was also different. Therefore, he felt that he had established his first proposition as to the anomalous state of the laws. He (Mr. M'Carthy Downing) had from time to time called the attention of Parliament to the many evils resulting from the state of the laws; he did so during the Administration of the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Greenwich (Mr. Gladstone), which led to a conference between the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Halifax (Mr. Stansfeld), then President of the Local Government Board; the President of the Board of Supervision in Scotland, and Sir Alfred Power, Chief Commissioner in Ireland, with the view of considering what remedy might be applied, but from which nothing resulted, in consequence of the break-up of the right hon. Gentleman's Administration. He did so, subsequently, in the discussion on the Union Rating Bill, and upon that occasion the present Secretary of State for the Colonies, then Chief Secretary for Ireland, said  ""The hon. Member for Cork had referred to another matter well deserving of consideration the differences which existed between English and Irish law with respect to the removal of paupers. As far as that was concerned, he 656 thought Ireland had fair cause of complaint, and he had been surprised that Irish Members had not brought it under the notice of the House at an earlier period of the Session."" In 1875, he (Mr. M'Carthy Downing) introduced a Bill, with the view of rendering it unlawful for justices in England or Scotland to remove to Ireland any poor person, where such poor person had for 12 months previously to relief being given, maintained himself, or herself, by some industrial occupation, in any parish, combination of parishes, or Union in England, Wales, or Scotland. On the discussion on that Bill, no one ventured to defend the law of removal, and he was glad to be able to say that there was an unanimous expression of opinion from the English Press that he (Mr. M'Carthy Downing) had made an unanswerable case. The right hon. Gentleman the President of the Local Government Board, upon that occasion, after dealing with the measure in the fairest manner, gave a promise  ""That the whole subject of settlement and removal would receive his attention during the Recess, and that he hoped in the next Session of Parliament to be able to submit proposals which would deal in a comprehensive spirit with the Poor Law of the three Kingdoms."" With that promise he (Mr. M'Carthy Downing) would have been satisfied, and not have taken a division, had he not yielded to the advice of his more ardent Colleagues. The Bill was rejected by a considerable majority; hon. Members who had spoken in favour of the principle in the Bill notably the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Halifax, and his hon. Friend the Member for Hackney (Mr. Fawcett) who made important speeches on the occasion declined to vote. The division, however, under the circumstances should make but little difference; it in no way affected the substantial success which the debate achieved, the system of Irish pauper deportation having been concurrently condemned. He was, however, apprehensive that the right hon. Gentleman the President of the Local Government Board had been influenced by that division, inasmuch as that the right hon. Gentleman had not since introduced the comprehensive measure affecting the three Kingdoms, which he hoped to have done in the Session of 1876. The right hon. Gentleman, however, introduced a Bill ""to provide for  657 the better arrangement of divided parishes"" in England, in which a clause was introduced 34 by which a person residing for three years in any parish obtained a settlement therein until he should acquire a settlement in some other parish a most imperfect solution of the question, as the labouring population were constantly forced to migrate from one parish to another, and seldom lived three years continuously in the same parish. A railway or new street ran through a poor quarter of a city filled with labourers' houses; labourers were thrown out of employment by derangement of trade, or other causes, and if they became destitute in the year subsequent, they lost their protection against removal. Had the right hon. Gentleman made a three years' residence in the Union instead of the parish, it would have been of large advantage, but as it was it was almost valueless. He (Mr. M'Carthy Downing), as he anticipated, found that the clause had not in any manner reduced the number of removals. The St. Pancras Union, Middlesex, made more orders of removal than any of the counties of England, and he found in the annual report of the assistant clerk, Mr. Higgins, for the year ending the 31st of December last, 12 months after the passing of the Act, the following statement:  ""The number of removable persons chargeable to this parish during the preceding 12 months who have gained a settlement, formed of a three years' residence, either wholly, or partly before and partly after the statute of last Session, is but very small, and the returns for future years will, doubtless, prove that the large number of cases originally supposed as being likely to come under such a class to have gained residential settlements in large towns will fall far short of the calculations of the most sanguine of those who have agitated for so long past, and on so many grounds, the great necessity of a change in the settlement laws."" And in the Return No. 5 in the said Report he found that the number of persons removed for the year ending 31st December, 1876, was 391; while, for the year ending 31st December, 1877, it was 524, showing an increase of nearly 34 per cent since the Act came into operation. He believed that the right hon. Gentleman intended the alteration which he effected as an experiment; that his opinion was in favour of the total abolition of the law of settle- 658 ment and removal; for he (Mr. M'Carthy Downing) found that at a conference of the Poor Law Guardians of the Southern counties, held at Basingstoke, under the presidency of the hon. Member for Northamptonshire, in October, 1875, the right hon. Gentleman the President of the Local Government Board said  ""Of all the arguments which have been brought before me for the abolition of the law of removal, none commends itself more to my mind than that if it were abolished, you would get rid of a most objectionable anomaly the administration of non-resident relief and you would have throughout the country a more uniform system of sound principles in the administration of out-door relief."" And with reference to the total abolition of the law of settlement, he said  ""I took the opportunity in the early part of last year to direct the attention of all the Local Government Inspectors to the question, and have received excellent reports from them, setting forth their own opinions, and, in many instances, the collected opinions of the guardians and their clerks, and I will not conceal from you the fact that there is a vast amount of opinion tending towards the abolition of the law of settlement."" The House would observe that all recent legislation had been directed to get rid of the law of settlement. The present Government could effect that object, and he hoped the House might hear from the right hon. Gentleman that it was their intention to do so in the next Session of Parliament. If so, the right hon. Gentleman could not object to his (Mr. M'Carthy Downing's) Motion being adopted. In fact, its adoption would strengthen his hands, and render his task an easy one. The Return from which he (Mr. M'Carthy Downing) quoted in the debate of 1875 was up to and for the 31st December, 1869. From it he read to the House several cases, which made a deep impression on hon. Members then present. He would not feel justified in again quoting those cases; but there were two which, if hon. Members made themselves acquainted with, might enlist their feelings in support of his Motion those of Catherine Stewart, page 110, and Mary Horigan and four children, page 88. As there were, in the present Session, so many Members who were not in the House in the Session of 1875, he would give the Particulars of the last-mentioned case, he was the wife of Michael Horigan, who was a Marine in the Queen's Ser-  659 vice, and at the time on active service in China. He was only seven months absent. He and his wife resided in Henry Street, Woolwich, for 10 years; had four children, the eldest nine years, the youngest one. She had been 27 years in England, and was only one year when she left Ireland. Her children were at the Military School, Woolwich. Her husband allowed her 15s. a-month; but, some delay having arisen in the payment, she received from the parish 2s. 6d. and two loaves of bread per week. Her husband had five good conduct stripes, and in six months he would have been entitled to a retiring pension. She was taken before a magistrate, and got to sign a statement upon oath that she had no settlement in England, and that she and her children would not suffer any bodily or mental injury by removal to Ireland. The nature of that document she did not know she could neither read nor write. She and her children were forcibly sent on to Bristol, where she besought the officer to take her back, and that she would pay all expenses, which he refused to do, and she and her four little children were delivered at the workhouse, Skibbereen, in the county of Cork. The case was brought before the Poor Law Commissioners by a strong and unanimous protest of the Guardians of that Union, and condemnation of the law which sanctioned the breaking-up of family ties and associations with the most heartless disregard of consequences and feelings of humanity. Here was a young woman and her four children forcibly and illegally taken from, her home, and transported to a place of which she had never heard. The consequence was that public indignation and sympathy were so aroused that a subscription list was opened and responded to. The Cork Steamship Company gave a free passage and 30s. for sea store, and Mary Horigan and her four children were in a few days again located at her own house at Woolwich; but by her return, should she again apply for relief, would be liable by the present laws to imprisonment for three months as a vagabond. He obtained a further Return under an order of the 15th August, 1875, and he found by that Return the like cases of gross illegality and cruelty as in the former. In page 6 would be found the case of Patrick Collins, removed from St. Giles-in-the- 660 Fields to the Kanturk Union, in the county Cork. He was born in London, where he resided until he was seven years of age. Afterwards he went to Ireland for some time. The man then returned to London and worked there for years, yet the magistrate certified that he was satisfied that he was born in, or last resided for the space of three years in, Ireland, and he was, accordingly, sent to the Kanturk Union. The form of warrant was one which had been long before abolished; and in reference to the case the Poor Law Commissioners, in addressing the Lord Lieutenant, said  ""There can exist little doubt that the printed forms had been deliberately framed, in contravention of the statute, for the purpose of carrying on the illegal removal of persons who were not born in Ireland."" Then there was the case of Ellen Connell and four children, the eldest eight years, the youngest one, sent from the Holborn Union to Cahirciveen, county Kerry. She being a married woman, her removal and that of her children was illegal, and under the warrant of a police magistrate, notwithstanding the unanimous decision of the Court of Queen's Bench that such removals were unauthorized by law. The Poor Law Commissioners refer to the case thus  ""As a further instance of improper practice in such cases in the London police courts."" And they conclude  ""There is now reason to believe that in a number of illegal removals which had taken place in the course of the previous year, that the forms had at all times been taken advantage of by parochial and Union authorities to obtain orders of removal without proper inquiry by the removing justices."" Upon this case the Poor Law Board of Whitehall addressed the Under Secretary of State for the Home Department, stating  ""That they had no control over the magistrates at the police courts. That they admit there is ground for the complaint of the Commissioners in Ireland, and they fear that it is not only as regards Irish paupers that justices make orders of removal upon loose or insufficient evidence, for complaints had been made to their Board that the justices do so in case of English paupers."" If the Poor Law Board had no authority over magistrates, the Home Secretary had, and a paid official was permitted by an illegal act to separate the wife and children from the husband and parent,  661 and cast the burden of their support upon the poor ratepayers of the Cahirciveen Union, and without any compensation to it or the ill-treated family. Mary Keating was removed from the parish of Liverpool to the South Dublin Union on the 7th of November; arrived in Dublin on the 8th, actually in labour, and gave birth to a child in six hours after her admission. The master of the workhouse reported  ""She appeared to be in labour when presented at the gate, and was confined in six hours after her admission."" And yet a medical man declared on soul and conscience that the health of the said Mary Keating was such as to admit of her removal, either by land or sea. The medical man defended himself by stating that the woman told him that she did not expect to be delivered for another month; but the woman gave evidence that she told him that she was then ill, and begged not to be removed. And the Poor Law Commissioners stated in the Correspondence  ""That the woman's statement was corroborated by the subsequent fact that she was actually in labour when presented at the gate of the workhouse."" He would ask, could anything be more cruel and more revolting to every feeling of humanity and manhood than the case just quoted; and yet it was only one of hundreds of others, varying only in degree? Another case referred to, and on which his hon. Friend the Member for Mayo (Mr. G. E. Browne), put a Question to the President of the Local Government Board, was that of John Tuoohy, who resided in England for 35 years, having left Ireland at the age of five. His wife was an English woman, and all his children seven were born in England. Tuoohy, for want of employment, was, with his wife and children, admitted to the workhouse at Kingston-on-Thames, and in 48 hours after a warrant from two county justices was obtained, without even the depositions required by law, under which this family of nine, the youngest being only 11 months, were shipped off to the Newport Union, in the county of Mayo, in which Union the man was not born, and never had been resident. In reference to this case, the Under Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, in addressing the then Home Secretary, said  662 ""I am directed by his Excellency to add that the above case is an illustration of the hardship of the present law with respect to the removal of poor persons from England to this country."" The Guardians of the Kingston Union were called upon to take back this family and to pay the expenses which had been incurred, which they refused to do; but, with great generosity, they offered to pay the expenses if the Guardians of the Newport Union would send the family to the Castlereagh Union, which he (Mr. M'Carthy Downing) might inform the House they, the Newport Guardians, had no power to do; and upon this point the Commissioners in Dublin in their Correspondence stated  ""The Guardians of Newport Union have no legal authority to send the paupers away at all, and they are thus, by virtue of the existing removal law in England, and the act of the English Poor Law authorities, burthened with the support of a destitute family, most of whom were born in England, and none of whom were born in the Union, or had previously been in any way connected with it."" He could supply hundreds of similar cases, but did not wish to weary the House. He must, however, refer to one or two cases from Scotland, for the information of his Scotch Friends. Mary Johnston, or Miller, removed from the parish of Larges, in Ayrshire, to Enniskillen, in Ireland. She left Ireland at the age of eight years, resided in Scotland for 26 years, was married there, had four children, the eldest seven and a-half years, the youngest two. They obtained some relief, and they were sent to Enniskillen, with which Union Mary Johnston had never any connection, having been born in the Union of Irvingstown. Every act in this case was illegal; the wife and children could not be removed without the head of the family; while in the order it was merely stated that she was born in the county of Fermanagh, and the only redress the ratepayers of Enniskillen had was an expression of regret on the part of Alexander Campbell, Inspector of Poor, for the mistake he had made. He asked the attention of the House to the facility with which families were thus illegally separated and forcibly deported  ""Minute of Inspector's Committee. Case of Mary Johnston, deserted by her husband three months; has no settlement in Scotland. Inspector instructed to take out warrant for the removal of paupers to Ireland.""  663 The House would observe that there was no inquiry before the Parochial Board, or opportunity offered for explanation or information by the parties concerned. They were taken before two magistrates or the sheriff, made to sign the usual printed form that they had no settlement, which in many cases would require the most experienced lawyer to decide. The Return gave but the Correspondence in cases where the Guardians request the attention of the Poor Law Commissioners; and, therefore, there were probably 40 times as many cases of which the public had not heard. One more case from the Return of August, 1875 that of Mary Lochrey, an orphan girl, from Greenock, to Innishowen Union, in Ireland. Her father got fever and died; the mother and her two brothers died from the same disease; she also caught the fever and alone survived. In the subsequent May she was attacked with small-pox, and removed to the Greenock Infirmary. After her recovery she was sent to the convalescent ward, and from that this afflicted girl was sent to Innishowen Workhouse, accompanied by some man named M'Kenzie, without any warrant. The Guardians of Innishowen called the attention of the Commissioners to the case in these words  ""Mary Lochrey, an orphan of seven years old, removed from Greenock. The child is only recovering from fever and small-pox, and the medical officer of the workhouse does not consider her sufficiently so to be placed in the ward with other inmates. She knows nothing about her previous residence in Ireland, and comes without the usual warrant, having only a medical certificate."" The medical officer, as in other cases, certified on soul and conscience that this wretched orphan was fit to be removed without danger of infecting others. He (Mr. M'Carthy Downing) would leave the estimate of this doctor's conscience to the judgment of the House; and as to whether he had a soul or not, he would not venture an opinion. Again, what redress had the ratepayers of Innishowen? None, save the expression of regret from John Deas, Inspector of Poor, who wrote to say  ""If her removal at the time, and in the circumstances set forth, had been the means, or was likely to be the means of spreading disease or causing alarm in the district to which she had been removed, he regretted it."" 664 And he (Mr. M'Carthy Downing) would particularly call the attention of the right hon. Gentleman the President of the Local Government Board to the explanation given by this Inspector why there was no order of removal. He said  ""I have further to state the journey to Ireland on the 16th July was undertaken in the following circumstances, and for the purpose of procuring reliable information, to enable the Board here subsequently to obtain a removal order, in the event of the parochial authorities at Innishowen, not being satisfied of their liability, or not being willing to undertake the future support of the said Mary Lochrey."" Against a system under which so inhuman and illegal an act could be perpetrated the voice of every humane or just man should be raised. Father, mother, brothers, all swept away within the short period of one month. This orphan of tender years alone recovered, but was shortly afterwards afflicted with the most fearful of all diseases smallpox. The merciful providence of the Great Judge again saved her life, and while she was but convalescent, the Parochial Board of Supervision, without warrant or other authority, handed her over to some unfeeling subordinate, who conveyed her to Innishowen, of which she had never heard, and with which she was in no way connected. He (Mr. M'Carthy Downing) did not wish to use strong language; but he found it impossible to refrain from characterizing the conduct of this Board of Supervision not only as unfeeling, but inhuman. He (Mr. M'Carthy Downing) hoped that hon. Members had read the Correspondence between the Board of Supervision in Scotland and the Poor Law Commissioners in Ireland, respecting the shocking cases of removal of lunatics from Scotland, manacled. One passage he would read from a communication from the Commissioners to the Inspector of Poor at Edinburgh. Thus, page 48  ""Recent cases of a shocking nature, in which, under the removal law of Scotland, dangerous lunatics have been taken out of lunatic asylums in Scotland, and removed in irons to workhouses in Ireland, have caused an aggravation of the sense of injustice referred to."" The account given in page 50 of the removal of John Cassidy and Peter O'Donnell revealed cruelty amounting to barbarity. He would not quote further from this Return, nor would he mention the many cases which had occurred since it was made, save one the  665 case of Thomas Hunt, sent from Bolton Union to Parsonstown, in Ireland, to which The Standard newspaper thus referred:  ""Thirty years ago he came over to this country from Ireland, and had full work as a stonemason up to six months ago, when he got a paralytic stroke, and was admitted to the Bolton Workhouse. He was instantly shipped over to his native place, and away from his wife and children. Hunt's case, as was shown in the debate last year, is by no means an unusual one; and, consequently, we must admit that the Union Chargeability Act, great an improvement as it effected in the old law, does not protect the poor from grievous hardship."" The manner in which those removals, cruel at the best, were effected, added to the hardship inflicted, and The North British Daily Mail, in referring to the same case, alluded to the fact that  ""The old man was the first to set a stone in the very workhouse from which he was so removed,"" And concluded by saying that  ""the Parsonstown Board unanimously granted the admission, and denounced the law that imposed such hardships on old paupers who had spent the best of their days in England."" Having, he hoped, satisfied the House on the second portion of his Motion, that great wrongs had been inflicted and sufferings endured under the operation of those laws, he would proceed to the remedy suggested by his Motion. His hon. Friend the Member for the Wigton Burghs (Mr. Mark Stewart) who moved the rejection of the Bill in 1875, admitted that a grievance existed, and expressed a hope that the Government would submit to Parliament some comprehensive scheme by which the law of settlement and removal would be placed on some satisfactory footing. He admitted that the relief system in Ireland was better than in Scotland, and the principal objection urged by him and the hon. Member for Liverpool (Mr. Torr) was, that if the Bill became law, the Scotch and English Unions would be overwhelmed with an immigration of Irish paupers. He (Mr. M'Carthy Downing) felt that he might put aside that argument, drawn from circumstances resulting from the famine of 1846, when the population of Ireland was 8,500,000; and when it was now under 5,500,000, less than it was 57 years ago. Ireland had not now a superabundant population, and with 666 regard to her pauper population, her position could compare favourably with that of England, and still more favourably with that of Scotland. His hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh (Mr. M'Laren) also admitted that he had established a grievance, but objected to the Bill on the ground of its particular scope and one-sidedness; and he (Mr. M'Carthy Downing) would admit that to have been the weak part of his case, because the law inflicted hardships and suffering on the destitute poor of England and Scotland as on the destitute Irish pauper living in England or Scotland, although not to the same extent nor accompanied by the same cruelty. He had on the present occasion taken from his Scotch Friends that argument, for his Motion applied generally the remedy which it suggested being that a residence of 12 months in any part or parts of England and Scotland by a person who maintained himself or herself by some industrial occupation previously to obtaining relief should be irremovable for life. The result of such a change in the law would be that after an industrial residence of 12 months in any part or parts of Great Britain, a poor person would be entitled to relief in the Union in which he became destitute, which would be an assimilation of the law to that of Ireland. It would be said that this might cause an undue accumulation of paupers in any particular Union; but that was met by a Statute that rendered a person liable to a month's imprisonment for going from one Union in which he had been resident to another for the purpose of obtaining relief, and by the fact that the Irish system had been found to work admirably, as proved by Sir Alfred Power and others. Then, as to the law of settlement, it must be recollected that it had been almost universally condemned. Every writer and statesman from Adam Smith to the present time had done so. A Select Committee of this House in 1847 passed the following Resolutions:  ""1. Resolved That the law of settlement and removal is generally productive of hardship to the poor and injurious to the working classes, by impeding the free circulation of labour. ""2. Resolved That it is injurious to the employers of labour and impedes the improvement of agriculture. ""3. Resolved That it is injurious to the ratepayers, by occasioning expense in litigation and removal of paupers.  667 ""4. Resolved That the power of removing destitute poor persons from one parish to another in England and Wales be abolished."" The evidence given before the Select Committee of 1859 was strongly in favour of its abolition. Every official Report and the evidence of the most experienced Inspectors were in favour of its repeal. Mr. Pashley, Q.C., a high authority upon the question, strongly recommended to do away with the laws of settlement, and to relieve the poor in the place they chose for their own residence; and Dr. Allison, Professor of Medicine in the University of Edinburgh, in a paper read by him at the Statistical Society in Belfast, said  ""The simpler, cheaper, and more satisfactory solution is to do away with legal rights of settlement altogether, and let relief be administered to destitution wherever it shows itself under the best checks that can be devised for ascertaining the distress and apportioning the aid given."" That was exactly the law as it now stood in Ireland, and he remembered that his hon. Friend the Member for Hackney (Mr. Fawcett), in a former debate, stated that the Irish system had been more successful than either that of England or Scotland. He believed that the public opinion of England was in favour of the abolition of the law of settlement, and that the feeling of the people of Scotland was in favour of a radical change in the law of removal. In the year 1871, Mr. Craufurd, then Member for Ayr, obtained a Select Committee, which received evidence for two years, and made a Report in reference to a residential settlement under the Scotch law, to the following effect:  ""The practical result is to throw many paupers back on the parish of their birth, frequently at the close of a long life spent in a totally different part of the country. This evil is aggravated by the fact that most of the towns which constitute the chief centres of labour are divided into more than one parish, and a change of residence from one part of the same town to another may either prevent the acquirement of a residential settlement or defeat it after it has been acquired."" Mr. Craufurd introduced a Bill founded upon that Report, but was unable to prosecute it before the late Parliament was dissolved. In the last Session, the noble Marquess the Member for Argyllshire (the Marquess of Lorne) presented a Petition from a Parochial Board in that county praying that towns receiving the benefit of the Indus- 668 residences of parties who had spent long periods in those towns should be charged with their support on their becoming paupers. He (Mr. M'Carthy Downing) now appealed to the good sense, judgment, and humane feelings of the Representatives of the people to support his Motion, which, if carried, must result in the repeal of the laws to which he had referred, and under which so much wrong and suffering had been endured. His appeal was not on behalf of the destitute Irish alone it was as well on behalf of the destitute English and Scotch. He felt that he had occupied a very considerable portion of the time of the House, and expressed his grateful acknowledgments for the patience and attention with which it had heard him. The hon. Gentleman concluded by moving the Resolution of which he had given Notice."	-37.0	1878.0	1870
630265	630265	S3V0333P0-03963		ADJOURNED DEBATE.	MR. C. A. V. CONYBEARE	Cornwall, Camborne	"MR. C. A. V. CONYBEARE (Cornwall, Camborne): I can only say, in supporting the Amendment of my hon. Friend, that whatever may be the result of the Division which will probably  1071 conclude this debate, the few hours which have been spent in discussing this important subject will not have been thrown away; because, even if the Government do not see their way to expressing much sympathy with us, and fail even to suggest a remedy for the distress to which we are giving expression, yet by the ventilation of the subject in the face of public opinion we may hope to have done some little good for the cause which we have at heart, for we may thereby hope to have aroused the public conscience. I may remark that this subject has for the last few years been constantly debated at Congresses and at meetings of scientific societies; but this is, I believe, the first time we have had a set debate upon it in this House. Now on this question the eminent statistician, Mr. Robert Giffen, speaks in the strongest terms, and his language should be taken seriously to heart. He says that no one can contemplate the present condition of the masses without desiring something like a revolution for the better. We are anxious to see a revolution for the better, and we are anxious to see it take the form of a peaceable and Constitutional revolution We only ask those who scoff at us for insisting on the importance of this question to turn to the pages of history, and consider how the negligence of Rulers in past times has prevented such peaceable revolutions for the better, and has caused revolutions of a graver kind to be substituted for them. We fortunately, in this country, have never seen revolutions of the worst type, nor do we wish to; but human nature is human nature all the world over. We shall soon be celebrating the centenary of the French Revolution of 1789; is it not, then, a season when our minds may be usefully turned to the consideration of the causes of the distress of the people? Now, Mr. Speaker, the proposition which I desire to emphasize and to give some facts in proof of is, 1072 not that the people of this country are worse off than they have been in the past, for we may congratulate ourselves that partly owing to the Repeal of the Corn Laws and the enormous expansion of our national commerce since the year 1846, and especially in consequence of the passing of the Factory Acts and other measures, the condition of the people, so far as their wage-earning capacity is concerned, is probably better than in past times. But the fact which I wish to emphasize is, that while the wealth and luxuries of the higher classes in the country have increased, the wealth and comfort and the general physical and moral condition of those classes who are beneath them in the social scale, and upon whose labour the wealth of the upper classes depends, have not increased in anything like a proper ratio. We want to see established throughout the country the principle of a fair day's wage for a fair day's work. We want those by whose labour all classes of the community are enormously benefited to be themselves benefited in a fair ratio; and I contend that at the present time the workers of the country do not enjoy a fair share of the wealth which they are mainly instrumental in creating. In my own constituency the miners of Cornwall labour eight hours a day for what I call the paltry wage of less than PS1 a week. The average pay in the Cornish tin mines is but 18s. a week, and you can positively find many instances in South Africa where even uneducated black men can earn with the greatest ease 10s., 15s., and even 20s. per week. There must be something wrong in our social condition in this country to keep our people slaving at these rates, when naked natives in South Africa can earn so much more relatively. We often hear references to the increase of imports and exports, but these figures should not be taken as a conclusive test of the improvement in the condition of the people. The increase is due mainly to the development of labour-saving machinery, by means of which the profits of the employer and the capitalist are enormously increased; and while large numbers of people are thrown out of employment by the change the wages of the workmen are lessened. As Professor Thorold Rogers says   1073 ""In the great majority of cases the whole advantage of a new discovery, a new process, and a new machine rests with the capitalist employer."" Until we succeed in discovering some way by which the profits of labour can be more equally divided between labourers and capitalists, we shall continue to press the urgency of this question. Again, the discovery of new fuel-saving appliances has brought about a great decrease in the cost of production, and a consequent increase in the profits. We contend that in almost all cases the enormous increase in the profits arising from this condition of things goes into the pockets of the capitalist, a very small proportion only going to improve the condition of the labourer. We must also recollect that there has been an enormous increase in the exports of various kinds of machinery, which tends to enable foreign countries to make goods which we hitherto manufactured. I do not complain of foreign competition, but I complain that these facts should be adduced as reasons why we should not lay such stress upon the necessity of improving the social condition of the people generally. I lay stress upon them for the purpose of showing that there is not a fair and equitable distribution of profits between employers and labourers, the latter of whom are the mainsprings of the wealth produced. I admit that the condition of the people in some respects at the present time may be said, when compared with that in olden times, to be considerably better; but if you will consider the facts you will see how far we are behind the ideal state of things we ought to set before ourselves as the only goal which, in a great and so-called civilized country, we ought to endeavour to reach. First of all, let me show the miserable character of the wages of our people. Mr. Mulhall, in his ""Dictionary of Statistics,"" gives the yearly income of the different classes of the people in the country. In the year 1883 he estimates that there were belonging to the gentry 1074 class 222,000 families, with an income of PS333,000,000, or an average of PS1,500 per family; of the middle class there were 604,000 families, with an income of PS241,000,000, or an average of nearly PS400 per family; of the tradesmen class there were 1,220,000 families, with earnings amounting to PS244,000,000, or an average of about PS200 per family; and of the working class there were 4,629,000 families, with earnings amounting to PS447,000,000, or an average of PS96 per family. Now PS96 is not a very large sum, even if it represented what every workman might hope to get in the year. It is, however, far from representing anything like what the vast number of our people get. What were the facts arrived at by a careful examination by the Mansion House Committee, which was appointed in March, 1885, to inquire into the causes of permanent distress in London? The Committee, referring to the North-side Docks not to the wharves on either side say in their Report  ""The number of casual labourers applying for work at these docks alone usually averages 2,500 to 3,000 daily. The total number of daily applicants for casual labour at all the docks may be roughly put at 20,000. According to the proportion of the above figures, there would be, therefore, from 7,000 to 8,000 men who, having no regular employment other than dock labour, daily apply, and apply in vain, for such work. A slight reduction (say 10 per cent) would have to be made on these figures, to allow for the possibility of some of the men applying at more than one dock on the same day. Regarding the smallness of wages, it is in evidence that the wages of the casual dock labourer do not exceed twelve shillings per week on the average of the year, and that the earnings of the unemployed, picked up by doing odd jobs, average four shillings and ten-pence per week per man, this sum being eked out by wife and children's earnings, charitable relief, &c. Female labour is wretchedly paid. In shirt making (for export) and similar employment, a woman gets about ninepence to a shilling for a day's work of sixteen hours. There are hundreds of women who work for three farthings an hour, and find their own needles and cotton. The prices include shirts, three-farthings each; flannel drawers for Chelsea Pensioners, one shilling and three-pence a dozen; soldiers' leggings, two shillings a dozen; and lawn tennis aprons, elaborately frilled, fivepence halfpenny a dozen to the ""sweater,"" the actual worker getting much less. In such kind of women's work, however, the whole profit does not, as is supposed, go to the ""sweater,"" but finds its way in great measure into the pockets of the middlemen and retail dealers. The public, too, have often, in some degree, the benefit of these starvation wages.""  1075 Now, it will be said that these are unskilled labourers, and that we must take skilled labourers if we wish to make out our case. As a member of the School Board, I have to inquire into the oases in which fees are remitted. I have here a list of cases in which the fees have been remitted because the parents are out of work or have a very small amount of work to do. Now, these parents are not all unskilled labourers. There are bricklayers; printers, polishers, carriage-painters, silver-platers, harness-makers, and others. In making out our case, therefore, we have not to rely solely upon the position of unskilled labourers. But I suppose it is in the Black Country that we find the hardest work and the lowest wages. I have here a collection of chains, which show exactly what is to be made by the poor chainmaker. Here is an ordinary dog-chain [chain produced]. The man who made this chain was paid for his work 1d. I ask hon. Members, who, perhaps, are not familiar with the facts, and who, perhaps, have not had an opportunity of visiting the chainmaking district, how they would like to make this chain for the money? Some of these chains I have seen made by women. I ask hon. Gentlemen whether they think the wage I have mentioned is one upon which men can live in decency, not to say comfort? Here is a chain familiar to many hon. Gentlemen, being connected as it is with harness; it is called a back chain, and for making it a man receives 11/2d. If engaged for a week of 60 hours in making these chains, a man can earn the munificent sum of 9s. This is a very weighty chain, and appears to be a complex piece of workmanship. I assert that the man who can make such a chain is no unskilled labourer. Another chain I have here is one for the making of which the workmen get 1d. It is called a halter chain. If a man works 60 hours upon the manufacture of these chains he can earn 6s. Here, 1076 again, you see, this is no mere ordinary chain, but one in which the links are twisted, and therefore not one easy to make. I am sure all reasonable men will agree that something ought to be done to improve the terrible condition of the chainmakers. The next feature of the work of the industrial masses which I desire to bring before the House is the precarious nature of their employment, and I think the facts I will now mention throw some light upon the statistics which are constantly placed before us when Government reporters and others go round and find that men are earning so much per week, and put it down as if it is the wage they receive every week in the year. I quote the following from a very competent authority, Mr. H. S. Foxwell, Professor of Economics at Cambridge, who, writing upon irregularity of employment and fluctuation of prices, says  ""The Rector of Gateshead, in a sermon recently preached before the University of Cambridge, speaks of steady, industrious men, nominally earning 20s. to 22s. per week, actually receiving, on the average, only 8s. or 9s. The London dock labourers, when in work, often earn PS2 a week; but they are sometimes six weeks, or more, without work. They are described as living filthily, and as stating that they 'would gladly exchange for PS1 a week regular.' Again, in an analysis of 273 cases made by my brother, Dr. Arthur Foxwell, in Manchester, he found that where the nominal wages varied from 14s. to 35s. a week in different occupations, the highest average earnings were those of the regularly employed Corporation labourers, whose nominal wages were 20s. Twelve joiners, nominally receiving 26s. 9d. a week, only averaged 13s. actual earnings; and four masons, nominally receiving 35s., only averaged 10s."" And here is what the Rector of Gateshead said, preaching at Cambridge in May, 1885  ""The wages of artizans, as paraded in Statistical Reports and the columns of the Press, sound fairly adequate. We hear with complacency of 18s. or 20s. per week as the remuneration of unskilled labour in towns; but few, except those in constant contact with the poor, know how very precarious such wages often are how for weeks and weeks a man, steady, industrious, willing to work, will often not average more than 8s. or 9s., and sometimes for long periods even nothing at all. Life is a sad and hopeless business when a man sits staring into an empty grate, weak and faint, after a weary, dispiriting search for work. No food for himself and, worse, none for his hungry children; no means of buying any, for the home comforts gathered round him in time of regular employment  1077 have been pawned one by one. Is it any wonder that, flying from his wretched home, he should hover round the one bright, cheerful spot in the neighbourhood, the public-house at the corner, and gladly accept the invitation of the first companion who offers to treat him, and so allow himself to be dragged down deeper still?"" I would also commend to hon. Members a few of the concluding remarks of Mr. Foxwell such as: ""The precarious nature of employment is a social evil of the first magnitude, which we can and must in some degree remove."" The statements I have made now presented to the House on the above authority are fully corroborated by the following, which will be found in the Report of the Industrial Conference which sat in 1885 under the presidency of Sir C. Dilke. Mr. Lloyd Jones then said  ""We have no stated allowance for lost time. This is so important a matter in connection with wages, that the sum deducted ought to be distinctly stated. Mr. Hey, one of the Secretaries of the Moulders' Union, has prepared an elaborate account from the books of his Society, and finds the time lost by their members to be 20 per cent, or one-fifth of the whole. This calculation, if carried out over the non-union workers, would be much increased, and this has to be added to depressions of trade, like that existing at present; and though generous efforts have usually been made to relieve the sufferings of those out of work, it is not going too far to say that not only savings, but wages yet unearned, have to be largely used to get rid of the indebtedness incurred at such times. Professor Leone Levi, in a recent article in the Times, brings the wages of the workers up to 523 millions sterling; but the calculation of Mr. Hey rubs out over 100 millions of this amount."" And the following statement by Mr. John Wilson (late a Member of this House) is remarkable, as well, for the evidence it gives of the spoliation of the miners by the royalty and rent-exacting landowners  ""It was said that in 1883, in the Cleveland District, PS400,000 were paid in royalty rents to landlords. Workmen and capitalists were contending with each other one for greater profits, the other for higher wages but they might join to bring about a reduction or the abolition of royalty rents. If the PS400,000 drawn last year were divided between capitalists and workmen, it would have gone far to prevent the distress now prevailing in Durham. He was Treasurer of the Durham Miners' Union, which week after week had been giving 8s. or 9s. to 600 or 700 men out of employment, who were thus, by the benevolence of men fellow-workmen kept off the rates. If this 1078 PS400,000 had been divided between employers and workmen, in place of destitution there might be prosperity. What right had the landlord to the mineral?"" I am not now upon the question as to what we shall do to remove this condition of things, but it is the duty of us, as legislators, to take these facts into consideration. I, for one, will not believe that it is beyond the power of Parliament to devise some means to correct these great evils. In the next place, I would ask the House to consider what is the effect of the present state of things upon the poorer classes, physically and socially? And in this connection it is important to notice that, out of their pitiably small and precarious earnings, the poor have to pay an altogether disproportionate amount in rent of homes, which, both from a sanitary and also a moral point of view, are too often wholly unfit for human beings to dwell in; and, further, that For all the necessaries of life they have to pay higher prices for inferior goods than people more fortunately circumstanced. Thus, as to their dwellings, in the Report of the Royal Commission on the Housing of the Working Classes we find it stated that  ""A large class whose earnings are the lowes are the costermongers and hawkers, whose average appears to be not more than 10s. or 12s. a week. This represents continuous toil, and although the income is a most precarious one, yet it is not rendered so by days and seasons of idleness, as is the case in occupations about to be mentioned, but depends on the state of the market. Dock labourers follow such an uncertain employment that their average wage is said to be not more than 8s. or 9s. a week, and at the highest from 12s. to 18s. a week. Fivepence an hour is about the rate, but the supply of this unskilled labour is so much in excess of the demand, that they are not employed, upon the average, more than two days a week. The average of labourers' wages in Clerkenwell is about 16s. a week, and this means that there are many who earn less. Mr. Marchant Williams says 'From investigation of parts of Clerkenwell, St. Luke's, St. Giles's, Marylebone, and other quarters, I find that 88 per cent of the poor pay more than one-fifth of their income in rent: 46 per cent. from one-fourth to one-half; 42 per cent from one-fourth to one-fifth; and only 12 per cent less than one-fifth of their wages in rent. These figures are gathered from nearly 1,000 dwellings. Among them 3s. 103/4d. is the average rent of one room let as a separate tenement, 6s. of two-roomed tenements, and 7s. 51/4d. of three-roomed tenements. Rents in the congested districts of London are  1079 getting higher, and wages are not rising, and there is a prospect, therefore, of the disproportion between rent and wages growing still greater. Evidence shows that the witness just quoted has erred, if at all, on the side of moderation. In South St. Pancras, 4s. a week was paid for one room 10 feet by 7, at 10 Prospect Terrace; the same at 3, Derry Street; at 22, Wood Street, 5s. was paid for a single room, and if cheaper quarters were needed, an underground kitchen must he sought at a rent of 2s. 6d. a week. At 8, Stephen Street, Tottenham Court Road, 5s. a week was paid for a single room in great decay. In Chapel Row, and Wilmington Place, Clerkenwell, 3s. 9d., 4s. 6d., and 5s. were rents for single roooms. In Spitalfields, the average rental for one room was from 4s. 6d. to 6s. a week. Most of these quotations are for unfurnished rooms. In Notting Hill, 4s. or 5s. a week per room was the rent of furnished rooms, and in the Mint 4s. 6d. for the same accommodation; the character of the furniture as a rule, in its wretchedness is beyond description. Instances might he multiplied from the Metropolitan evidence. Many of the tenements just cited are dwellings referred to as instances of extreme over-crowding.'"" These are not singular figures, nor figures relating solely to the Metropolis. I have here a report of a lecture upon ""Life in One Room,"" by Dr. Russell, the Medical Officer of Health for the City of Glasgow. Some of Dr. Russell's remarks are deserving of the serious attention of hon. Members, because the conclusion they point to is that the congestion of our working population in great cities is tending greatly to the moral as well as physical deterioration of our race. In Glasgow much has been done to improve the dwellings of the poor and the general condition of the people; but Dr. Russell says  ""Of the inhabitants of Glasgow 25 (24*7) per cent live in houses of one apartment; 45 (44*7) per cent in houses of two apartments; 16 per cent (6*1) in houses of four apartments; and only 8 per cent in houses of 5 apartments and upwards."" And then he goes on to say  ""I am anxious to emphasize this difference by the accumulation of facts which can be expressed in cold figures. Figures are beyond the reach of sentiment, and if they are sensational it is only because of their terribly undisguised truthfulness. You must not think of the inmates of those small houses as families in the ordinary sense of the term. No less than 14 per cent of the one-roomed houses and 27 per cent of the two-roomed contain lodgers strange men and women mixed up with husbands and wives and children within the four walls of small rooms. Nor must I permit you, in noting down the tame average of fully three inmates in each of these one-apartment houses, to remain ignorant 1080 of the fact that there are thousands of these houses which contain five, six, and seven inmates, and hundreds which are inhabited by from 8 up even to 13 per centage, though an accurate, are but a feeble mode of expression for such facts regarding men and women like ourselves. I have told you that in 1881 the population of Glasgow was 511,520 persons, and that of those 25 per cent lived in one room, and 45 per cent in two-roomed houses; but what does that mean? It means that 126,000 persons live in those one-roomed and 228,000 in those two-roomed houses."" Then Dr. Russell goes on to say  ""There you will find, year after year, a death rate of 38 per 1,000, while in the districts with larger houses it is only 16 or 17."" These are figures and facts which it is impossible for us to contradict, and which it is dangerous and almost criminal of us to neglect. Now, the questions of the earnings and the inadequacy of the homes of the poor are not by any means the only questions we have to take into consideration in dealing with the social condition of the people. The cost of living is another element in the problem which it would be idle for us to underrate. Mr. George B. Sims, one of the noblest of the many philanthropic men who have devoted their lives to doing something to improve the condition of the people, points out that the poor are obliged to purchase in small quantities, and therefore get the lowest value for the highest price. For coal, for instance, the poor pay 1d. for 7lbs., or 13/4d. for 14lbs. that is, at the rate of PS1 7s. 6d for a ton, which is only worth 16s. or 17s.; and butterine is sold to the poor at 1s. 6d. per lb., while it is not worth more than 9d. or 10d. Tea is bought by the humbler classes at 13/4d. or 2d. per oz., which means 2s. 8d. for a pound, which is only worth 1s. 4d. Now, I do not propose to trouble the House with figures relating to the pauperism in our midst; but I desire to point out how every pound of the income of this country is spent what proportion goes to the Army and to the Navy, and what proportion is spent in the actual government of the country. Of every PS of income we find that the Customs  1081 and Excise Duties contribute 12s. 73/4d. and that proportion of the taxation of the country is the one which falls most heavily upon the lower classes. Of every PS of Expenditure of the country we find that 16s. 11/2d. goes for war, leaving only 3s. 101/2d. in the PS for all other purposes. If we take the year 1881, we find that 35*08 per cent went in Interest on Debt resulting from past wars, 31*95 per cent in expenditure for war, and 32*97 per cent towards other purposes connected with the Government of the country. Or put it in another form. We can show that during the present century the total income of the country was 5,613 millions, of which 3,550 millions, or more than three-fifths, came from Customs and Excise Duties, including Post Office, Crown Lands, &c., and that four-fifths of the whole Expenditure, or 4,660 millions, went in expenses of war, war debts, and preparations for war. When we find facts such as these, and seeing that so great a proportion of the burden falls on the working classes, we have a right to contend that they should reap far greater benefit from the expenditure than they possibly can do now, and that it would be infinitely better to diminish and not to increase, as you are now proposing to do, the enormous sums expended on war and warlike preparations. If you must vote larger sums, let it be for the amelioration of the condition of our people. There is, in particular, one class of expenditure too little thought of in this country, and to which, if it were less grudgingly granted, we might look as providing one of the best remedies for many of the evils of which we complain. I refer to education. In England we spend only PS6,685,000 on education, as compared with PS28,900,000 on the Army and Navy, while in the United States they spend PS18,600,000 on education, and only PS9,400,000 on warlike preparations. Our conten-1082 tion is, that we should reverse our proportion of expenditure; that we should spend a great deal more on what tends really to the benefit of the people, the prosperity of the country, and cut down very much more than I am afraid many of us are at present inclined to do the terrible amount continually lavished, thrown away, and wasted in all manner of warlike expenditure. Before I resume my seat I should like to touch on another subject and in only a few words. I do not wish at all to elaborate the question of remedies to be devised. That is the duty of the Government. I am not here to maintain that there is any one special cause of the evil, and much less that there is any special panacea to be advocated for the present state of things. I know it is an exceedingly complicated social problem, and all I now ask is that the Government of the country should devote some attention to, should show some sympathy if only by a casual reference in the Queen's Speech with the sufferings of our people. Still, in one direction we may look for a remedy for one principal cause of the difficulties that surround us, the congestion of population in our great towns. Here we may for a remedy look to migration not to emigration of the unemployed labourers for the purpose of taking up and occupying land at present unoccupied or not tilled in different parts of the country. I know it will be said that it is useless to settle on our farm lands the unemployed, who are, for the most part, ignorant and unskilled labourers. But the persons who advance that objection are the very advocates of the deportation of these same ignorant and unskilled labourers to our Colonies, which, however, refused to be burdened with them. In the United Kingdom, including the Channel Islands, there are 80 millions of acres of land, and in 1880 there were only 48,335,000 and odd acres under cultivation, notwithstanding that at the same time the population was 34,862,000, or less than half the total number of acres. Now, in a rich country like this, where, without exaggeration, the population is  1083 in the proportion of one to every two acres, surely it is idle for anyone to get up and say the country is over-crowded, and that we must drive out and expatriate men from our midst and send them to other countries to assist with their skilled labour in developing the industries of those countries in competition with ourselves. We find, at the same time, that one-half of our food supplies comes from abroad. I do not dwell on the danger this presents if we should be engaged in a war with any great Continental nation it is sufficiently obvious. But, if 40 millions of acres can produce food for half our people, we may fairly reason that if the whole of the 80 million acres, or the greater part, were under cultivation, you would not only be able to keep all your people in the country, without continually drafting numbers of them out of the country, but you would be able to be very much more independent, and produce, at any rate, a much larger supply of food to maintain them. But some people say, ""This is impossible; the land remaining untilled is barren land, and will not repay cultivation."" That is simply not true, and will never be true so long as there are millions of acres withdrawn from cultivation, merely to satisfy the sporting and predatory instincts of our land monopolist aristocracy. But taking only those lands which are, or are supposed to be, at present under cultivation, I may point out that at the present moment the produce of the land is not nearly what it might be. I can show that if a system of small holdings were introduced, which would mean placing on the land that is cultivable some hundreds of thousands of starving people who now go to make up the congestion of population in our large cities, you at once supply homes for the people and necessarily increase the output from the soil. For instance, if, as is estimated, the annual value of the agricultural produce of the three kingdoms is from PS250,000,000 to PS300,000,000, as it was when this pamphlet, from which I now quote, was published a year or two ago, and the number of acres under cultivation 47,000,000, then we find the annual yield to the acre is scarcely PS6 10s. That being so, let us see what evidence there is that this can be in- 1084 creased. I take a few words from a speech delivered in 1885 by Lord Carrington, well known as a sound agricultural authority. He said  ""Around High Wycombe he had 800 allotment tenants, who occupied a tenth of an acre each, and who paid him the agricultural value of the land, plus the rates. The net produce of each allotment was PS4 that is, PS40 an acre. The most a farmer could make out of the same land under plough cultivation would be PS7 an acre. So in these 80 acres under allotments PS2,640 worth of extra food is produced, and altogether PS3,200 worth of wholesome garden stuff is grown, the result of the spare time and labour of artizans which would otherwise probably have been wasted."" Commenting upon this the writer of this pamphlet says  ""Then surely it may be asked, if land can be made to produce food stuffs to the value of PS40 an acre, under spade labour, and during the leisure hours of the mechanic, why cannot the farmer at least produce half of that amount that is, PS20 an acre in lieu of the niggardly PS7 per acre under plough cultivation?"" Why indeed? And with these facts before us it is almost a crime not, at any rate, to try the experiment of relieving the congestion and misery of our cities by migration, by establishing village communities in those rural districts which are now almost bare of a rustic population. If such an experiment were only partially successful, it would, we are satisfied, do much to relieve the miseries and social evils we have laid so much stress upon; and, at the same time, it would tend to the social elevation of the people, and remove a great danger which exists in the possibility of our food supplies being cut off, if we were at war with a Continental nation. It would be a more sensible way of meeting danger than by increasing our armaments. It is an utterly futile and absurd idea to suppose we can always keep pace with foreign armaments by lavishing more and more on warlike preparations and home defences. Let me say, too, on behalf of the cause we champion, that we do not ask your charity; we do not want your money; we do not want a grant for the starving poor to salve the consciences of the rich, and to tide over a period of great dis-  1085 tress and misery; we ask for more justice and less charity. We ask that the absurd laws which now restrict the industries of the country and prevent the transfer of land should be done away with. These things can be done by legislative means. We ask you to lighten the burden of labour, and one and the most important means of doing this is to break down that monopoly in land which is at present the curse of the country. I do not wish to say a harsh or an offensive word, but I would remind hon. Members that we who have arrived at a position of social comfort and independence, some by our exertions, while others have never known a day's toil, may be regarded by men and women who toil for long hours day after day, month after month, for a paltry pittance insufficient for the necessaries, much less the comforts of life, not unnaturally with bitter feelings as an idle class whom their labour supports; and I would urge the House on the score of humanity, if on no other grounds, to devote some serious attention to these matters, and to make one united effort to deal in a practical and not merely a speculative spirit with this great social problem, and endeavour to solve it in a way that shall conduce to the future greatness and prosperity of our common country."	-37.0	1889.0	1880
746771	746771	S4V0034P0-00828	1895-05-24	THE OPIUM COMMISSION.	*SIR JOSEPH PEASE		"*SIR JOSEPH PEASE replied that Sir J. Lyall was in receipt of a pension from the Indian Government. Continuing, he said, that the grossly partisan reports occupied 240 pages, while the actual and independent portion covered only 126 pages. 130 medical men were examined. Of these, 82 were official, 14 missionary, and 34 independent. Of the officials, 44 were favourable, 18 indifferent, and 20 unfavourable. All the missionaries were unfavourable to the use of opium, half the independent medical men 17 out of 282 34 and 20 officials. There were thus 51 medical men on the one side, against 51 on the other. A sample of the one sidedness was shown in the report dealing with Burma (p. 92). The Commission said  ""We have no suggestions to make as to the administration of the measures sanctioned by the Government of India in November 1893, and we recommend that they be maintained unaltered till they be fairly tested by experience."" Sir Charles Aitchison reported in 1880. The Indian Government held out till 1893. Sir Charles said  ""Here the question is not one of better or worse morality, but the salvation of a whole people from a vice which we have introduced among them, and from ruin, which it is to a great extent in our power to retard, if not prevent. There was no time here for experiments if the people were to be saved."" The Indian Government still retarded Sir Charles Aitchison's recommendations, and this Commission called it, in fact, a mere experiment. Another example was as to the drugging of infants (p. 16). The arguments put forward in support of the practice was that it was used to prevent diarrhoea, to correct the mother's milk, and to keep the child quiet. ""It was impossible to believe that this custom should have been handed down for many centuries amongst a people whose general fondness for their children was well known, if it were as injurious as some witnesses seemed to think."" The evidence as to the drugging of infants was as follows:  ""Surgeon Lieut-Col. Hendley puts in summaries of replies from 55 persons at Jeypore, on the use of opium. The answers referring to children concludes: Baneful custom, as it causes atrophy, constipation, fever, etc. The principal cause of infantile mortality here.' Witness adds, 'The opinions of all are much the same.' In the municipal report of Lucknow for 1891, Dr. Cleghorn wrote, 'Another cause of mortality among children is the almost universal practice of giving infants opium.' Dr. Huntley states, 'I know that I have come across many deaths in children owing to an overdose of opium, and still more die from the continuance of the habit. Within a radius of half-a-mile of Jodhpore hospital I certainly can produce 20 cases.' Miss Rose Greenfield of the Charlotte Hospital, Ludhiana, said, 'Many children's lives are lost just by an overdose of opium.' She had no doubt a certain number of girls are still killed by opium intentionally. Miss Carlton, M.D., definitely confirmed this. A native witness  283 stated 'girls are more generally drugged than boys.' Surgeon Lieut-Col. Mayne said, 'I continually saw children given opium, and I have seen some deaths among them from its injudicious use.'"" Throughout its inquiries the Commission seemed to have forgotten the real character of the drug. In 1843, Lore Shaftesbury took the opinion of 27 of the most eminent medical men in London, who described the pernicious consequences of the opium habit as destroying the healthy habit of the digestive organs. There was also the testimony of upwards of 5,000 medical men of the present day, many of then eminent in their profession, including 14 professors of materia medica, 23 doctors who had practised in India and 12 in China, stating distinctly the deleterious effects of the drug. A book entitled ""Rudiments of Sanitation for Indian Schools,"" edited by Surgeon Captain Patrick Hebair, M.D., laid down the pernicious consequences of the opium habit and the necessity of at ones counteracting it, even at the expense of great physical suffering for the time, and it ended with the moral to the Indian children not to touch opium. He would go as fast as he could through the great Indian points. They were told that the drug was used as a prophylactic and as a febrifuge; that it was essential to the cultivator; that it was difficult to arrange matters with the native states; and that our native soldiers required it. What was the character of opium? Gloss it over as they liked, it was a poisonous drug. The great difference between alcohol and opium was this: Thousands took beer, wine, and spirits took alcohol one day, but did not, perhaps, touch it the next; took it in fact in moderation; whereas an opium smoker or eater must have it, or he failed in his daily task; and the evidence was conclusive that in almost every case he must have more and more of the drug. No one objected to the use of opium purely as a drug. As to the allegations that opium was a prophylactic and a febrifuge, Rai Lal Bahadur, L.M.S., graduate in medicine and surgery, president of Calcutta Medical School, lecturer on ophthalmic medicine, and for 30 284 years in Government employ, examined as to its being a prophylactic, stated:  ""It is to my mind a new theory. It is not a theory I ever heard as a student or as a practitioner,"" and added  ""I do not think it a remedy in fever."" Moreover, a memorandum of the Government of Madras was as follows:  ""The Government are aware that the opium traffic is carefully watched by the agents and their assistants, and that, so far from 'teaching the people to rely on opium as a febrifuge,' we are doing all we can to gradually wean them from their heriditary habit of using it on all occasions."" Dr. J. R. Wallace, M.D., who had had 14 years' experience in Calcutta, both in Government service and private practice, said:  ""I have never seen or heard of any physician in Calcutta or elsewhere who prescribes the use of opium for the prevention or cure of malarial fever. I have recently read of the good effect of opium in preventing and even curing malarial fever. I have given the theory a fair and honest trial during the past 10 or 12 months, and I am thoroughly convinced that beyond relieving the bodily pains and aches of malarial fever, it in no way prevents or shortens its paroxysms. I firmly believe that the action of opium in malarial disorders, in which there is a strong tendency to congestion of the liver, spleen, and kidneys, is not only distinctly contra-indicated, but its administration in many such cases would be undoubtedly harmful."" ""I have frequently found serious complications follow the use of opium when given as a sedative in cases where the liver had undergone inflammatory or degenerative change from any cause. I base this opinion further upon the teaching and practice of many able and experienced Indian physicians, such men as Norman Chevers, David B. Smith, Coates, Harvey, and M'Connell, men whose lectures and practice I have attended and seen, and from whom I never heard a word of commendation for the use of opium in malarial fever; men who, as far as my recollection serves me, have always condemned the use of opium in congested conditions of the liver a condition which, sooner or later, complicates every case of malarial fever."" Then as to the cultivation and character of the opium crop and its necessity to the cultivator. It was universally admitted throughout the Blue Books, and in the Report on the ""Moral and Material Progress of India,"" which was laid on the Table of the House of Commons in May 1892, that the cultivation of the poppy was being reduced on account of other crops turning the poppy out of the  285 market. It was giving place to better paying crops. From the Report on the ""Moral and Material Progress of India,"" page 89, he quoted:  ""It is reported that cultivators of opium have lost heart, after experiencing three bad seasons in succession; that new cultivators are gradually withdrawing from the industry, while there is a tendency on the part of older cultivators to lessen the poppy area cultivated by them in favour of the more robust and less precarious cereals."" The Behar opium agent adds:  ""The opium department have difficulty in maintaining their position; they cannot drop cultivation at will without losing it permanently."" The problem was how to keep the land in poppy cultivation, and that was the difficulty of the Government in 1891. In 1894, in a copy of the Resolution of the Indian Revenue Department, it was stated that  ""the decrease in the area of poppy cultivation was accounted for by the following reasons: (1) The policy of the Government was not to take any measures for increasing the area of cultivation; (2) a series of bad seasons, which had disheartened the opium cultivators; and (3) the cultivation of other crops."" The end of these difficulties was that the Indian Government, since the Commission left India, in order to produce a crop at all, had to make an additional advance of 20 per cent. i.e., from 5 to 6 rupees per seer, or at the rate of 10s. 6d. per acre, to the cultivator. While it was confessed that in many places the production of the poppy was an advantage to the cultivator, yet there was perfectly clear evidence to show that in other places the crop was being rapidly superseded by crops of other articles far more beneficial to humanity; and he could not help thinking that if the Government of India would turn their attention less to the production of opium and more to that of other crops, it would be to the benefit of the cultivator and mankind at large. The next point was the argument that the cultivation of the poppy was required by the native states. Now the number of chests from those states had gradually fallen away since 1886. In 1886-7 the number of chests on which duty was paid was 39,745, and in 1894-5 they fell to 27,750. Thus, in spite of all the encouragement that 286 had been given to the native States, the quantity of opium that passed out of them for duty fell by 33 per cent. Baroda, which used to send 2,000 chests, now sends no opium at all. But granting for a moment that the native States went on with the cultivation of the poppy, he admitted that the Government was not responsible for the deeds of those States to the same extent as for those of India proper. The Government were able to leave the states to take their own course, but if, by the Government giving up the cultivation, the demand and price of the opium of the native states were increased they could restrain the increase as at present by raising the transit duties. The Indian Government reduced them from 750 rupees to 600 rupees, and had now again raised them to 650, where they could keep them with all justice to the native States if they desired to wash their own hands of the trade. Another argument on this question (what was termed the soldier argument) was that opium was essential to the native soldier but it altogether failed before the Commission. The evidence showed that there were no fewer than 23 native regiments 16 regiments of the Bengal Infantry, 5 of the Punjab Infantry, and 2 of the Sikh Infantry which never touched opium at all, and in those in which it was taken the practice was condemned and its effects were shown to be prejudicial both morally and physically. ""'In the 15th Bengal Infantry each man took opium with him according to his requirements; in the 23rd Bengal Infantry three pounds taken up by the Commissariat Department sufficed for two years; in the 32nd Bengal Infantry one pound was taken regimentally, to be issued when ordered, but was brought back unused; and in the 3rd Sikh Infantry a small quantity was taken up by the regimental chowdhri for use if required, but was brought back untouched.' Major-General Sir Robert Low, who held the important military command of the Oudh district, said that the native troops under him were both Hindus and Mahomedans living in the North-West Provinces. The opening questions and replies 14,108 to 14,112 ran as follows: 'As a rule are these men opiumeaters?' 'No.' 'I presume there are exceptions in almost every regiment?' 'Yes.' 'What is the highest number of opium-eaters reported in any one regiment under your command?' 'Twenty.' 'And the lowest?' 'Two, that is in the Ghoorka regiment.' 'Is there any regiment in which none are reported?' 'There is one.' General Low said when he was in the 13th Bengal Lancers twelve years ago all the  287 Sikhs took opium habitually in small quantities. The exact amounts he could not remember. Referring to a servant of his who had taken opium for a long time, the General said: 'I did not know that he used it to excess until up in the hills we found ourselves without it. Then he became perfectly useless, and we had to send many miles to get some.' Resaldar-Major Nur-ul-Hasan said that in the 6th Bengal Cavalry, in which he had 'served for thirty-six years, about three per cent. used opium.'"" It was further proved (Q. 16,952) that, of 240 Sikhs in the 10th Bengal Lancers, ""only eight or nine took it all the year round."" Of the 2nd Punjab Infantry, Colonel Turner said that ""only two or three per cent. take opium regularly,"" and the Surgeon in charge said:  ""He had no doubt that it had a prejudicial effect in cases of pneumonia."" Colonel Briscoe, 19th Bengal Lancers, said, he gave no numbers, because the numbers varied so greatly. It is also fallacious,"" he said, ""to take a percentage of Sikhs, because it is very rare for a young Sikh to take opium at all. The habit is chiefly amongst middle-aged and old men."" This evidence was confirmed by most of the witnesses. The last of the Sikh regiments inquired into at Delhi was the 29th Punjab Infantry. Lieut.-Colonel Reid said the general tone of the regiment ""is against its use;"" that ""the habitual opium eater's appearance was against him, for he seemed to have deteriorated physically."" The Colonel said further in his evidence:  ""'Nine men, that is 1 per cent. of the regiment, habitually eat opium .... of whom 3 men, or one-third per cent. of the regiment, eat in excess; and 6 men, or two-thirds per cent., eat in moderation.' 'Morally the results are bad. The habitual opium-eaters are marked men in the regiment, and are not trusted like the rest. I would not enlist an opium-eater if I knew it.' Only one commanding officer of Bajputs appears to have given evidence, viz., Colonel Jamieson, 7th Bengal Infantry. He stated that in his regiment 12 men used opium in moderation and 1 in excess. The general evidence from the Sikh States shews that taking opium before 40 years of age is considered objectionable, and a species of licentiousness."" Then, with regard to the condition of the soldier in China, Consul Allan, Chefoo, said (Vol. 5):  ""I expect that the civil and military officials would indignantly deny that men under their orders smoked opium. In fact, the Brigadier-General in charge of the troops told me that he dismissed at once any soldier caught smoking opium."" 288 In the same volume, Consul Bullock, of New Chang, said:  ""Ask a Chinese which would win in a fight, a regiment of men allowed to smoke opium or one of similar men who were prevented from doing so, and he will laugh at the simplicity of the question. ... Opium-smoking is condemned in Chinese opinion as degrading, because injurious. The public voice cries out against it as a great evil to the nation."" Again, Consul Hurst, of Tainan (page 323) declared:  ""As long as China remains a nation of opium-smokers there is not the least reason to fear that she will become a military power of any importance, as the habit saps the energies and vitality of the nation."" Speaking of India alone, so far as malarial disease was concerned, so far as the native soldier, the cultivator, and the native States were concerned, it was shown by the evidence that there was no force in the argument that the cultivation of the drug was essential to or required by any of them. He now came to what was perhaps, after all, the crucial part of the position he took, and that was opium-smoking. He had never, in any speech he had made on the question, and he was not aware that any of his hon. Friends had done so, gone deeply into the habits of taking opium pills or small quantities of the drug. What he and his friends had always gone steadily against was the trade in opium and the practice of opium-smoking in China, the Straits Settlements, and in India itself. On this point he was at one with the Commissioners, for he was glad to say they went straight against opium-smoking in India. In paragraph 80 of the Report, the Commissioners said:  ""On the other hand, it was clearly shown before us that native public opinion generally Condemns the habit as disreputable, mainly, perhaps, from its associations, and this opinion is shared by the great mass of European witnesses, official and private, including the medical practitioners."" Again, on page 118, they say:  ""The practice of opium-smoking is generally looked down upon in India as a low and vicious habit. Several of the witnesses thought the practice and especially that of madak smoking injurious to health. Others thought that the injurious effects were not due directly to the smoking, but were due to the associations and surroundings of the habit. These are certainly  289 very bad. The practice of smoking seems to require that it shall be carried on in company, and the premises or 'dens' in which opium-smokers meet in India are of a squalid and insanitary character."" This view was confirmed in the memorandum of Mr. Haridas Veharidas, one of the native members of the Commission, which was attached to the Report. He said:  ""The practice of opium-smoking is generally condemned, but nothing short of its abolition by law will, in my humble opinion, put an end to it. It is most desirable that it should be made penal.... A strict law should be made prohibiting opium-smoking in any form and under any circumstances."" The Maharaja Bahadur of Durbhanga stated in a note supplementary to the Report of the Commissioners, that while he thought it was impossible to make any suggestions that could apply to the whole of India, and therefore hesitated to lay down any hard-and fast line, yet:  ""he would urge that opium should be sold in bottles or phials labelled ""poison,"" and the minimum dose which was likely to be fatal should also be legibly printed in the vernacular on these labels. ... The habit of opium-smoking is generally looked upon as a degrading habit. Mr. Haridas Veharidas has entered into the subject very fully; and I find myself in agreement with his views on the subject."" Other native gentlemen in various parts of India took a similar view. Among English officials who gave evidence, Mr. H. B. M. James, of the Northern Division, B.B., said:  ""In India it is a degrading vice, the mark of of a debauchee, and 99 out of 100 who practise it are degraded and worthless, perhaps criminal persons."" Mr. J. M. Campbell, Bombay, said:  ""Though the description under review may be overdrawn and misleading, the practice of opium smoking is evil and wasteful. It would be well if it did not exist."" The collector at Satara said:  ""The vice of opium-smoking evidently possesses a fearful fascination when once it is acquired, and its effects are deadly, depriving the victim of all moral resolution. With these facts made palpable, it is a serious thing for Government to offer any facility for acquiring the vice by licensing a shop, where anyone is at liberty to make a trial."" To the same effect he might quote many other witnesses. Now as to the prevention of the evil the Commissioners 290 stated that though they were unable to recommend the adoption of measures of restrictive legislation, yet they did recommend that the licensing of shops in the province for the manufacture and sale of opium should be abandoned. On page 72 of the Report the Commissioners said:  ""While we are not prepared to recommend measures of restrictive legislation, we are in favour of making it difficult for smokers of Chandu and Madak to indulge in the habit. We recommend that the Government should abandon in all provinces the licensing of shops for the manufacture and sale of these preparations, showing thereby that they are in sympathy with public opinion. In the Punjab, Bombay, North-Western Provinces, and Oudh this has already been done, and in those provinces, individuals, though they may manufacture the preparations for their own use, are not permitted to possess a larger amount than 180 grains weight. We recommend that these provisions be extended to the other provinces of British India. The manufacture of small quantities by private persons is wasteful, and the process tedious. Only confirmed smokers therefore are likely to incur the expense and trouble. The general adoption of this system, which is undoubtedly repressive, so far as it can be enforced will tend to prevent the spread of the habit, and lead, it may be hoped, to its ultimate extinction."" The Commissioners came nearly up to his standard in dealing with the question so far as opium smoking in India was con-concerned, whether they took the recommendation of the English members and Indian officials who proposed to take away the licences of shops for the manufacture and sale of opium, or whether they adopted the advice of the two native members of the Commission, who knew the country intimately, and who suggested that opium smoking should be put down by law. The trade in opium is falling away. The revenue from it in 1880-81 was Rx. 8,451,382, and in 1894-95 it had fallen to Rx. 4,138,300. Opium-smoking in India was condemned as a low low and vicious habit; and now he proposed to prove that in China this habit is undermining society, and from its effects the people were surely deteriorating. Mr. E. Starkey, who had been for 27 years a merchant in China, said:  ""There are many smokers in moderation, but usually after ten years or so of indulgence they suffer in health and require increased doses. The opium habit is undermining society in this province (Chin-kiang); the moral standard of non-smokers is affected by it, and the people are surely deteriorating.""  291 This gentleman was formerly an importer of opium. Our Vice Consul at Canton, Mr. Bourne, said:  ""It is correct to say that there can be no moderation: excessive habit is condemned as degrading and injurious, but the moderate habit only as likely to lead to excess."" Mr. Williamson, Acting Vice Consul in Corea, quoted Dr. Landes as saying:  ""It ruins morally and physically at least 90 per cent. of the Koreans who use it."" Mr. Frank Trench, of Chung-king, in China, said:  ""Opium-smoking is an unmitigated evil. It has enormously added to the sin and misery of this country. It weakens every physical power before long, and makes wreck of the man or woman eventually for certain."" Sir George Staunton, who was the representative of the East India Company at Canton, said, many years ago:  ""It is mere trifling to place the abuse of opium on the same level with the abuse on spirituous liquors. It is (i.e., the abuse) the main purpose in the former case; but in the latter it is only the exception.'' Miss Geraldine Guinness, who wrote ""Four Years' Sojourn in China,"" had travelled through six of its provinces, and was also personally acquainted with the opium question in Tonquin, the Straits Settlements, Colombo, and Aden. She gave a graphic account of some of her opium experiences in China. She spoke of how her heart ached and bled during the painful hours in which she had worked by the bedside of women and girls who had poisoned themselves by opium to save themselves from fates worse than death, to which they had been sold because their fathers and husbands wanted opium. ""The opium vice,"" she said, ""is not one crime simply, but a concentration of all crimes."" She spoke of the great opium palaces of lust in Shanghai that she had visited, where hundreds of women were held in bitter bondage. ""Crimes of the blackest dye,"" she affirmed, ""are directly traceable to opium in China."" Archdeacon Wolfe, in 1888, wrote:  ""The devil could not have invented a more pernicious vice for the destruction of soul and body than this of opium-smoking, and woe to the man who by word or deed gives any support or encouragement to the hell-born traffic! Men openly and without shame prostitute their wives, in order to procure for themselves the 292 means of indulging in opium-smoking. Little children are sold as slaves and turned away from the embrace of their helpless mothers in order that their degraded fathers may have money to buy opium. All this and much more may be told of the effects of opium-smoking on the miserable people; yet professing Christians in England see no harm in it, and openly advocate the abominable traffic, which makes it possible and comparatively easy for the Chinese people to ruin themselves and their wives and children for time and for eternity!"" In answer to the questions issued by the Commission and sent to China, there were varying estimates of the proportions of opium-smokers who suffered more or less injury. The medical missionaries said 71 per cent.; other missionaries, 74 per cent.; medical officials, 55 per cent.; sundry medical men, 61 per cent.; Consuls, 58 per cent.; other officials, 40 per cent.; one merchant, 80 per cent.; and the Sassoons, who were importers, 10 per cent. An LL.D. of Oxford, who was now in the pay of the Chinese Government, in sending a contribution to the Anti-Opium Society, wrote:  ""Having lived among the Chinese for 34 years, and seen the disastrous results of the fast-increasing consumption of opium, it has long been my wish to aid in any reasonable scheme that may be started to remove this enormous evil, which has undermined and almost destroyed the very life and strength of the nation. Japan, with her total exemption from the use of the drug, is proving more than a match for China, now almost overpowered by it. I fear that China has to go through a dreadful course of humiliation and suffering before she can be driven to free herself from the baneful effects of opium by using the strong and drastic remedies that are now necessary. Japan is a most dangerous enemy, but even if China can withstand a Japanese invasion she can never survive unless this soul and body destroying poison is completely exterminated."" He had proved that that portion of the revenue derived from supplying the army deteriorated the soldier and was immoral. Certainly that derived from the drugging of infants was immoral, and as certainly that derived from facilitating suicide and murder. No fewer than 53 witnesses admitted that opium was continually used in the promotion of sensuality. A gentleman living in Singapore, who had studied the question carefully, said:  ""The more I investigate the subject the more plain and clear is the ultimate connection between opium and sensual vice.""  293 Surely this was an immoral revenue. In India smoking was condemned on all hands by our own Commission, by the native Commissioners especially, and by our intelligent officials. All called out for the abolition of the habit and the destruction of this portion of our immoral revenue. When we turned to our customer China, the evidence was stronger still that our opium and her own were causing her destruction as a nation. Ninety per cent. of our revenue came from China, and we were aiding in ruining China by participating in the trade. We could not get over the fact that, although China might supply herself and did supply herself, we were participators in that which was immoral; and this was the ground on which he asked the House to vote for the Resolution. The argument that if we were not to supply China with opium China would supply herself is one which was very well met in John Dymond's Essays on Morality. He said, practically: I have no right to do that which is wrong, if it is wrong, because somebody else is going to do wrong. His words are:  ""If I were to sell a man arsenic, or a pistol, knowing that the buyer wanted to commit murder, should I not be a bad man? If I let a house knowing that the renter wanted it for purposes of wickedness, am I an innocent man? Upon such reasoning you might rob a traveller on the road if you knew that at the next turning a foot-pad was waiting to plunder him. To sell property or goods for bad purposes, because if you do not do it some one else will, is like a man selling his slaves because he thought it criminal to keep them in bondage."" This was their position: it was not that we supplied the whole of China, but that we supplied China with that which was immoral in its character and consequences, and was deteriorating to China. The hon. Member for Central Finsbury (Mr. Naoroji) purposed to make an addition to the Resolution; and that Amendment expressed views which he held; but he had not touched upon the question of finance, which was referred to a Commission. There were many who believed that our Frontier Policy in India was a policy which was of an expensive and unknown character, and required placing on a more permanent basis. Since the Afghan war we had had 10,000 more English troops and 20,000 294 more native troops. Whether we required them or not, Parliament had not the means of knowing; but the cost of them was largely eating up the increase in the revenue of India. In 1891 Mr. Smith declared, as Leader of the House and of the Government, that the policy of the Government was to diminish the area of poppy cultivation, and that it would be persevered in in the future. Mr. Gladstone put pressure upon the Government to pursue that policy, and the House carried the Resolution in favour of greatly diminishing the cultivation of the poppy and the production and sale of opium. What was the Government going to do or say now? In 1891 six Members of the Cabinet, and 12 of the rank and file of the Government, declared their conviction of the immorality of the opium trade; and in 1893 the majority of their supporters voted against the appointment of this Commission, believing that the House had settled the moral question involved. Were the Government now going to put an end to smoking opium in India as recommended by the Commission? Were they going to repudiate or to fulfil Mr. Smith's pledges of 1891? Were they going to withdraw or add to Mr. Gladstone's pressure of 1893? Was their policy one of continuing to draw a portion of their revenue from this foul source, or would they endeavour to abandon it? He had proved that a great portion of the comparatively small Indian revenue was a revenue immoral in its origin, that the Chinese and Singapore trade was an immoral trade, and that we were making profit by debasing our neighbours. Some of them had laboured hard believing that the good name of this country was at stake. Opium might be capable of being used in old age or for medical purposes with advantage; but the trade in it generally was an immoral trade. The Christian Churches said so, political economy said so, morality and ethics said so; and all these forces would ultimately unite to say that the country should not carry on a trade which was so debasing and demoralising in its character. He concluded by moving the Amendment."	-39.0	1895.0	1890
887261	887261	S4V0105P0-01170	1902-03-19	AGED PENSIONERS BILL.	MR. GOULD1NG	Wiltshire, Devizes	"MR. GOULD1NG (Wiltshire, Devizes): I do not think that those responsible for this Bill need be discouraged with the reception it has received, for every Member who has spoken has given it his blessing, with the exception of my hon. friend the Member for Stretford, who has dealt with the Bill critically, and he is against it, but he shelters himself behind Lord Rothschild's report; but that Committee reported that they had been precluded from considering any old age pension Bill which they wished had not been the case. The right hon. Member for West Birmingham in this House regretted that they had so misinterpreted their instructions, and said that that was not intended. My hon. friend has a scheme 494 of his own which would create a pampered class, and it would only affect those in permanent and good employment, while going to saddle industry with the expenditure of old age pensions; but the casual labourer and women who in, their age require these pensions are left outside. For some time past this country has been convinced that the treatment accorded to our deserving poor in old age requires radical reform. A Committee appointed by this House in 1899 and presided over by a Cabinet Minister made careful investigation into the matter and reported  ""We recognise and we entirely concur in the force of this expression of opinion; but, on the other hand, we are unable to ignore the fact, abundantly supported as it is by the evidence we have had before us that cases are I too often to be found in which poor and aged people, whose conduct and whose whole career has been blameless, industrious, and deserving, find themselves, from no fault of their own, at the end of a long and meritorious life, with nothing but the workhouse or wholly inadequate out-door relief, as the refuge for their declining years."" Again the great friendly societies to whom the country is so indebted, had in too many instances the shadow of insolvency hanging over them. Mr. Stead, the well-known friendly society secretary, declared that 75 per cent. of the deficiency in the funds arose from old age sick pay pay given to men who were not sick in an ordinary way, but sick with chronic illness due to the infirmities of old age. A Return issued in 1893 showed that I in 3 over the age of 65 are in receipt of poor law relief. When you make a reduction in these figures of the well-to-do, you have the alarming fact that 3 in 7, or nearly one-half of the working classes in this country in old age, no matter what their calling or past conduct may have been, come under the stigma of pauperism. While we know that many endure untold hardships, exist on an inadequate sustenance often on the verge of starvation, rather than suffer that which is both repellent and repugnant to their whole nature viz., association with those whom they have always avoided, and to whom freedom and independence have no attraction. The First Lord of the Treasury in his election address, and in many speeches  495 since, and in letters, acknowledged that this question has to be solved, and stated it must engage the anxious attention of the Government in the future. The right hon. Gentleman the Member for West Birmingham I will quote a sentence of his, though I exonerate him entirely for not tackling the question when his hands are so full at the Colonial Office. The right hon. Gentleman said  ""I want, before my political life is terminated to see something done for the old. I want to see something done in order that men who have led a life of toil may look forward without dread to the old age that comes upon all of us."" And again  ""Legislation which will help to smooth the declining years of the poor against pauperism, these are the things that is the programme for which I believe the overwhelming vote has been given in the present election."" I quote the right hon. Gentleman because there is an important letter from the Prime Minister on the question in 1898, in which he said  ""I have expressed more than once my full approval of the principles involved in Mr. Chamberlain's proposals. "" As we have heard a good deal as to how the money is to be found, I would like to read what the Chancellor of the Exchequer said, not as an ordinary M. P., but as Chancellor of the Exchequer. He said in 1895  ""The Government also intended to reform the poor law, and in co-operation with the great friendly societies to aid poor working men in some way or other in their old age. It was time, too, that they considered the condition of those who were reduced to end their days through infirmity or old age in the workhouse. It was time that they should ascertain whether they could not give to the deserving amongst them comfortable quarters something like home, something that they need not look upon as he feared they now looked upon the institution with loathing and with pain."" The right hon. Gentleman the President of the Local Government Board is also pledged on this question, because he said at Bristol  ""The labouring poor had become very impatient and they did not understand the Parliamentary etiquette which compelled the question to be shelved."" Therefore I think the promoters of this Bill may almost claim the thanks of the Government, and their support, for bringing forward a scheme for consideration today. 496 To my mind, with the question of Old Age Pensions is inseparable that of Poor Law reform. There are many inmates of workhouses who are better housed and surrounded with greater comforts than many of those who contribute to their keep, and of the recipients of Poor Law relief who are above the age of sixty-five, some 370,000 on January 1st, 1892, nearly two-thirds are classed ""outdoor,"" and so to a large extent deserving poor. We are spending in this country eleven and a half millions a year on Poor Law, and one and a half million goes in the payment of officials the cost of in-maintenance in London is PS28 14s. 2d. per head. Add to it repayment of loans, wages of officials, and it rises to the great figure of PS38 10s. per pauper in the rest of England and Wales, in-maintenance is PS11 7s. 5d., add repayment of loans, wages, etc., and it rises to PS22 7s. 2d. I should like to know where some of our deserving poor would be if they had distributed among them even their portion of that sum, without the taint of the Poor Law, and were able to spend their days with their friends. I would like to point out that the figures I have given do not include the payment to those who have outdoor relief, nor are the salaries of the relieving officers included. If we remove from the category of paupers the deserving poor over 65 years of age, our poor law should be administered at a much less cost to provide for the thriftless and improvident. The promoters of this Bill have endeavoured to give effect to the recommendations of the Committee presided over by the right hon. Member for Sleaford they desire to utilise existing machinery adapting it so as to remove all taint of pauperism, so as to avoid that in any scheme there should be a large portion of the money granted by Parliament for pensions, eaten up by a new army of officials. The salaries and wages of the present staff of the guardians amount to nearly one and half millions a year. There are close on 1,800 relieving officers, men well acquainted with the history of the poor in this district. How do they propose to remove the taint? A special Pensions Committee considers and decides on the claims and nothing need prevent that Committee being strengthened by co-option. The  497 badge of free citizenship remains the payment of the pension is made through the same channel, viz., the Post Office, as for other pensioners or, in cases where the pensioner has no friends living with whom he cares to reside, he can live in cottage homes with all his; freedom. We class these men as aged pensioners they would rank as deserving veterans of labour in the same way as the Chelsea pensioners represented the, deserving veterans of the service. In the beginning there would exist two lists, as it is rightly desired that those deserving poor at present in the workhouse should be able to regain their freedom without delay. The County Councils have, through their spokesman said that they have not the necessary machinery. The Poor Law Association, on the other band, welcome the work. Then, Sir, it is proposed that the Local Authority should administer the fund, and that they should benefit from the saving that will ensue in the administration of the ordinary Poor Law they also pay the larger share to ensure economic working, while the Treasury contribute PS6 a year per Aged Pensioner. It is not proposed that the Treasury should have any representative on the administrative authority, because all the money given for Old Age Pensions should be used for that purpose, and not for the payment of officials. The Committee presided over by Sir Edward Hamilton estimated that the scheme would cost ten and a quarter millions in 1901, and twelve millions in 1911. Everyone who has studied the report of that Committee will see that it was extra liberal in its allowance. Every aged pensioner in England was to have 6s. a week, and in the case of Scotland and Ireland 5s. 6d. per week. It will be agreed that 5s. a week given to an aged person as a pension would be considered as adequate for most agricultural places, and for residents in Scotland and Ireland. The only complaint against the scheme is that the cost would be too great; but that complaint has been advanced whenever Old Age Pensions have been considered, and long before we incurred our present expenditure. We are now paying extra taxation for the war without any inconvenience. One thing, at 498 all events, this war has shown, and that is that the nation can bear the necessary taxation required for this purpose without much inconvenience. The old argument that the country could not afford the outlay has had the bottom knocked out of it. I have alluded to the pledge given by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. If the Chancellor of the Exchequer will follow the policy he inaugurated last year, and boldly broaden the basis of taxation in order that all may contribute, then the amount will be quickly and easily raised. I do not believe even the old theories of free trade would stand in the way. Earmark the taxation for Old Age pensions, and I believe it will be cheerfully paid. Those of us who have taken an active part in this measure are very glad that my right hon. friend the President of the Local Government Board is the Minister responsible. We all know his courage and sympathy, and many of us on this side of the House cannot forget the great help he gave us in the last Parliament in extending the Workmen's Compensation Act to agricultural labourers. I would entreat my right hon. friend to add to the gratitude of his followers in this House, the gratitude of the untold number of the working classes throughout the country, by taking the solution of this question on his shoulders, and by establishing a scheme of old age pensions before this Parliament comes to an end. His sympathies are with the industrial poor. He has never hesitated to show it in his speeches and actions. I would point out to him that during the last century Parliament was mainly occupied in satisfying the wants and removing the grievances of the middle classes and the well-paid artizans. Little or nothing was done for the industrial poor; but surely in this twentieth century it is time to give them an innings. When many of the continental nations are dealing with this question, when many of our Colonies are tackling it, surely it behoves the Mother Country to wake up, and for this Parliament to declare that it will wipe out the inscription that is to all intents written over the portals of many of the working classes: ""Abandon hope in old age,"" and the fear that is engraven  499 in their hearts and haunts their old age that they will have to work for a certain period and then their certain doom is the workhouse. Let this House decide to burst these shackles once and for all that sorrow the declining years of the deserving poor, and determine that the deserving poor, as well as the rich, in this country shall end their days emancipated and free."	-35.0	1902.0	1900
